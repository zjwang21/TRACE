Vice Mayor Lowenthal. Councilman Andrews. Councilman Richardson recalled recommendation to cancel the city council meeting of August 4th, 2015, due to National Night Out.Thank you, Councilman Mango.National Night Out is a fantastic event that last year, once I was elected, was the first year that I could not attend, and we had several dozen community groups get together and host events in their communities. And I really felt like it was an important part of my role as a councilman to be encouraging the community groupsto meet on National Night out and to stand up for themselves and public safety. And so I would hope that considering how long our council meetings go, it might just make more sense not to have one because we we thought last year we'd be out by seven and make the rounds.But Commander LeBaron and I weren't able to make it to any because of actually, I think he got out a little earlier than I did, but we were here so late that we couldn't attend any of them. So I hope that we will be supportive of getting out in our community and talking to the neighbors.Councilman Andrews.Yes, thank you, Mayor. You know, I'm glad that we brought this forward because I was wondering what it'd be like to attend the National Night Out. And then on Wednesday, the community comes together with, you know, with the various activities.And since I've been in my office, my staff members have always had to attend and volunteer if needed. So I'm looking forward to this myself, and thank you for bringing this forth. This is not going.Thank you, Councilmember Richardson.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thank you, Councilmember Mongo, for bringing this forward. This is huge national night out and it continues to grow. We've got one of the best ones in the Gardenia Avenue BLOCK Club. You know, we've got a number of neighborhood associations who host them.And because I have come to city council meetings for the last five years since I was chief of staff as well, I've never had the chance to actually attend one of them. So. So I look forward to the opportunity of attending my first national night out because I will not be at the city council meeting.Should the city council vote on this item?Sure.Thank you. Next, we have a many Lowenthal.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I just wanted to appreciate Councilmember Mungo's effort to raise awareness and generate interest in crime prevention activities in our community. District to neighborhood and business associations have partnered with Long Beach PD to host National Night Out events in the past, and I certainly welcome their collaboration this year.Hopefully if we are to take action on this, many of us will have an opportunity to visit these folks that are partnering with our police department. Thank you.Okay. Next up is. Sorry Councilman Rasta thank you.And I have myself attended many national night out so not since I've been on the council and you know I will be supporting this this motion. However, I do know that, you know, the reason we don't get an opportunity to do this generally is because this is this falls right in our budget cycle.And I was curious to know whether or not, you know, if the budget is going to be released on that day. Are you are we going to wait a week to comment on that? Or is there going to be a study session or anything like that?Yeah, there actually is going to be a study session, a pretty in-depth study session, from what I understand earlier in the day. Or it will be at four and then it will be over by the time the events start.At about 330.But I'm not I mean whatever time that it gets an upsetting but sure. Okay they'll figure it out. Nexus.

Motion carries with you now item 90.Item 19 Report from Financial Management Recommendation to receive and file the Fiscal Year 20/21 Budget Performance Report City Wide.Mr. America. Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor. We will have a report from our Director of financial management, John Growth, and our budget manager. Manager Great Noon. Essentially, we provided a document to the public and to the council about the impacts of COVID 19.And that's something that we'll go over with now with our with our finance team.Good evening. And member of the city council. This is Greece. This is the first performance report of our flight and includes an initial assessment of the COVID 19 pandemic impact on our flight to finances, as well as the potential impact on outyear budget projections.This report, as our city manager just mentioned, is based primarily on the April 13th, 2020 memo that is needed as an attachment to the performance. The COVID 19 pandemic, along with the measure and litigation, has exacerbated our projected budget situation.The Budget Office, under the direction of the city manager, will develop a plan to address the situation, which may be a multi-year plan to be implemented over several years. The size of the projected shortfalls indicates that there will likely be significant impact assessments beginning next year and at Fy21.Long Beach is not alone in this. As many cities in California and across the country are dealing with the financial crisis caused by the pandemic and having to consider similar major actions. This projection is based on assumptions and information available during the early stages of the pandemic.So it is important to note that the economic and.Can't hear anything. Hi. This is John GROSS. I can continue this. Can you hear me? Okay. Go for it. Okay. So but Grace was saying is it's important to note that the economic environment and impacts are constantly changing and we will be impacted constantly.We will. Shortfall at the end of.I think Greece is coming in and out. Let me continue. For this report. We anticipate that there are five funds that are impacted, the general fund measure a special advertising and promotion entitlement and the airport. Yes, Grace. I'm continuing because you're going in and out, so it might be easier for me to continue.So we expect about 38 to 44 million in overall revenue losses or unbudgeted expenditure increases across the fund, across all these funds for the general fund we're talking about for FY 20 potential shortfall of 14 to 22 million.If no corrective actions taken in Greece, then the manager will be taking some corrective action. This shortfall takes into account potential revenue losses and expenses related to the pandemic that are unbudgeted and not reimbursable. And it does not include any costs that may come from assistance to businesses.For Measure A based on the current projection. We're expecting a shortfall in revenues of around $7 million, but due to strong up by 19 performance, we are expecting to end on budget based on current projections for Measure eight.We just don't have extra money for special advertising and promotion fund. Were anticipating a revenue loss of about $2 million and by the end of the year the funds available may drop from 5 million to only about 900,000 at the end of the year.The budgeted expenses in Fy20 are not reduced. We still do have an operating reserve of 5 million set aside for operating profit fluctuations and the future Olympics. Four Titans. There's going to be a revenue shortfall of at least $6 million, primarily in oil revenue.And future projection updates will also take into account the potential loss of ancillary revenue used to pay debt service entitlement fines, which include potentially the aquarium, the Queen Mary and Rainbow Harbor. For the airport fund. We're expecting a revenue loss of about $10 million in this year due to low passenger volume.And there is currently a very high cash stream due to both that revenue loss and the cost of capital improvement projects. And the airport staff is reviewing those actions. We've been really helped recently by $18 million from the CARES Act and that will really help the situation.Other funds are anticipated to be impacted by the pandemic, but with a lesser overall impact. As the manager and a decrease talked about, the city manager is implementing budget actions with regard to the pandemic spending to protect the city and its services as much as we can.We will certainly spend whatever we need to spend to address the pandemic. The actions we may take and the is looking at is evaluation of one time projects for saving, reduction of non-pandemic operating expenses where feasible, and actively looking for funding and other mechanisms to offset the cost.In addition, if we need to, we may need to go look at using city's operating and emergency reserves at the end of the year. The bottom line is that the pandemic is having a significant and severe impact on our finances.We will continue to update our projections and update City Council on new development strategies and actions being taken, and that includes the staff report. And hopefully Greece is back on the line and we're available to answer questions.Yeah. Thank you, John. I am back on a daily there this time, so hopefully the connection will be better. But thank you very much.Thank you and thank you both for a great presentation. So I want to just just briefly just say that I'm just so impressed with our finance team. I think we all have nothing but great things to say about this team.And you guys have been just really fantastic during this crisis. What's the most important thing in this emergency is to ensure that we are providing assistance to the public, making sure that public safety resources are out there and that we are doing everything we can with our resources to take care of the public and make sure peopleare safe and healthy. And you guys have all been quick to make that adapt, to make changes, and to then begin preparing for the future. I think we should all be prepared and understand that the budget this upcoming year is going to be tough, it's going to be hard, and we're going to have some tough decisions tomake. And I know that the Council is committed to centering and ensuring that people remain safe and healthy as our top priorities. And it's going to require us to also reprioritize other things that may have been important in the past.And we need to know and be certain that that that the future of our city has to be being being prepared to take on these large health challenges to stay, keep people safe, and provide those basic services that people expect.And so I think all of that is going to be in front of us in the future, and I look forward to those discussions in the months ahead. Councilmember, your anger. Thank you, Mary. I think I totally support everything that you said.The staff has been doing an excellent job and making solvent through a move to approve the report. Thank you. Could somebody cue up a second, please? If I can get a second and a second by Councilman Richardson. But then government.Do you want to add anything? But for the most. Okay. Councilwoman, I'm going to give anything to add.I just want to thank everyone for the work. And I think it's going to be critical that the reimbursements come in. And the second tier on a multi-year approach, I think is the most.Prudent.Way to handle a lot of these big challenges. And I think that we're are just going to need to be patient.With Aaron and pitch in.Because we need to come up with a way to make sure that we.Protect our.Workforce and our city services for the taxpayers.Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.I support the motion and I really want to thank the team, both the finance team and POM. I think you guys have done a great job. I'm really happy that years ago somebody decided to put together an additional fund, so I know that we'll end up relying on that.Hopefully not as much, but I think everyone's done a great job. Thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce.No comments, Mr. Mayor. I was just a little late to the game of extending the motion.No, no problem. Catherine Ashton. They also want to just congratulate. Well thanks down for for this is very very clear look at our budget projection over the next fiscal year. I want to go to the summary of actions.It's certainly support this, but I did have some questions regarding this four points in the summary on the staff report and the three. As far as where people place a hold or counsel discretionary one time pandemic related expenditures, which I certainly support and suggest that we should avoid starting or expanding to what are discretionary and structural programs. I would absolutely support reduced budgets, structural costs, while support that improves because you see savings in that piece. I want to kind of get in on what exactly does that mean? Mr. GROSS Increase simplification. That means we're going to institute potentially hiring freezes.A couple. Remember at this time we are not implementing a hard hiring freeze, but that is definitely something. We are working with the city manager's office to evaluate and consider what we mean by increasing vacancy savings. And we are taking a much harder look and scrutinizing requests from departments to fill positions that are currently vacant right nowand evaluating the filling of those vacant positions to ask whether this position can be delayed in hiring due to the redirection of staff to respond to the COVID response? Or is this something that we could put on pause longer term?And as we evaluate each case on a case by case basis, and if there are positions we delay in hiring, that will naturally create savings within the department's operating budget on a one time basis, at least for now, within FY20.So in approving this item tonight, are we giving staff the go ahead to move and take these actions? Implementing actions.Just remember we.So Councilmember this time. So we're essentially just kind of outlining what our strategy is. The council is going to be fully plugged in before we start canceling any major projects. So we're in the evaluation phase. We're managing the budget kind of on a daily basis.So in terms of, like great said, we're going to evaluate whether we need to fill positions or not. But we if and we're looking at every single expense about whether or not we should move forward. So I am placing some holds on those so that we can generate savings.But before we completely cancel any projects that, you know, you'll get a report from us on, on what our recommendations are and be able to weigh in on those going forward. Thank you. I just need that clarification. Thank you, Councilmember.I think that concludes our coverage of the questions, councilman, often about. Okay, great.

That one is.It's the Sarah Henry, the POW. I think we're trying to admit her.Okay.Thank you for bearing witness.The lady with the bookmarks.See? There she is.Get them to us momentarily. Councilmember Desai, did you have questions about this? Comments? Did you want to hear the staff report?I don't have questions or comments, but if the staff member wants to. Perhaps for the purpose of the public. Very briefly, describe what five is. I believe it has to do with Proposition 15.Sarah, you're muted.Molly. I am here now.This is, by the way, Sarah Henry, our amazing public information officer. She also staffs the Commission on Persons with Disabilities. There's a whole lot more so. Oh, yeah. And keeps up with our legislative agenda, both state and federal.Yeah.So I didn't prepare a presentation tonight on this item, but this is the Proposition 15 on the November ballot supporting the Schools and Local Communities Funding Act. It is taxing the commercial property an annual or every other year assessment of actual value versus when it was sold.And the city has to gain what stands to gain about $7 million a year from this, the school district would gain about $5 million a year from this. And then, of course, our transit agencies and other municipalities would gain a lot as well.Thank you. Any questions or comments? Thank you. Miss Henry, there's another Sarah. I have a meeting with her tomorrow. Councilmember Desai. Any questions? Great. Just let me just comment.I don't support the split role tax approach. I believe we need to, because this is all about modifying Proposition 13. And I get and I understand that there's an argument that commercial and industrial wasn't meant to be part of Proposition 13 when it was passed in 1978.But the reality, though, is that especially in the times that we're in, it's particularly the very small businesses, the small mom and pop type of businesses who would be affected by this? Sure. The city of Alameda or even the school district stands to gain from this split roll approach.But I believe as a matter of principle, I believe Proposition 13 should remain intact, as it was originally put together back in 1978. It served businesses and residential quite well, and I would hope to see it continue the way it is in terms of dealing with funding issues.There's a whole range of other approaches that that I believe California ought to take. And so I'm not supportive of this flat roll approach.Thank you. And just a thank you. And then perhaps one of my colleagues whose hands are up might want to clarify some of the provisions in Prop 15. But I thought the vice mayor stand up, then Councilmember Vela, then Councilmember Ody.I'm pointing to where you.Are and I.Don't know where you.Are. I won't say much. I will say vice mayor, vice mayor, former vice mayor and current vice mayor. And actually, we were going to bring actually a referral asking our council to adopt this this evening. And so I just wanted to give my thanks to the city staff for actually seeing the importance of this and the councilweighing in on this and bringing it forward. You know, I think what we know about Prop 13 is that there were loopholes that were left in that have unintentionally removed billions and billions of dollars each year from our schools, leaving our local communities underfunded in ways that many of us.I didn't grow up in California, but people of my generation benefited from, and then we removed it from them, transferring the tax load from companies who used to pay for it to homeowners and individuals today. I'll let my other colleagues weigh in, but I just wanted to thank our staff for bringing this forward.Thank you, Councilmember Vella.Yeah, I just wanted to clarify, there were some statements made that I think don't accurately reflect what Prop 15 actually does with regards to small businesses. Prop 15 exempts all commercial property below $3 million in value, which is pretty significant.And it provides a tax cut on business equipment that will actually mostly benefit our small businesses. So I want to clarify, there's a lot of misinformation out there that this is going to hurt small businesses. It's actually not geared at them at all.In fact, this is about having places like Disneyland pay their fair share. Disneyland is paying almost nothing per acre and they have lots and lots of acreage, as well as large parking lot owners and folks like that who have, you know, large scale commercial properties.These are not small businesses. These are businesses that have considerable wealth and equity in their property. So if your individual property is exceeding $3 million, then you will not be exempt from Prop 15. So I just wanted to clarify that.I did want to echo the vice mayors statements, and I'm very glad that staff brought this to us. I think this very much needs to be done. This loophole needs to be closed. Our our youth and students and everybody who works at public schools and in public education deserve this.This is an investment in our future and making sure that large corporations like Disneyland pay their fair share. So I'm going to be supporting this today.Thank you. By the way, it was the mayor and staff that brought it forward. But I know I thought we would be mostly supportive, but we thought that it's good to bring it up to vote. And Councilmember Ody had his hand up.Then I'll go back to Councilmember Days. I can't remember that.I will also thank the mayor and staffer and Sarah for bringing this. Henry sorry for bringing this this up. I mean, as much as we all would love to be back in 1978, I mean, we're not. Times have changed.I mean, one example of that changes. In 1978, our school system was in the top ten in the nation, and now it's in the bottom ten as far as funding. So I spent the better part of the last month talking to almost any almost everybody running for election this year in Alameda County.And, you know, with COVID 19, there's a lot of issues with funding. And you saw the staff report. We'd be. To receive $7 million, which would be a good shot in the arm for the city of Alameda to deal with all of our unfunded obligations.But, you know, some of our transit agencies are hanging by a thread. And that 24 million that would go to AC transit may make the difference between having a transit agency and not having the transit agency. And then you saw the others, whether it's Bay Area Air Quality or East Bay Mud or BART or, you know, thePark District, which, you know, we're going to be depending on heavily for some of our future recreational needs in the city. I mean, this is way overdue and I hope it passes the first time. If it doesn't, we'll go at it again.Thank you. Councilman Brody, let's hear from Councilmember Desai, then you, Mr. Henry.Just quickly, while while the owners of property who are small businesses generating no more than $3 million might not be subject to this. The small businesses will still be subject to this because many of them are tenants of larger properties.You could just go to South Shore Shopping Center, for example, their tenant. There are small businesses there. There are small mom and pop businesses throughout, not just Alameda, but California. And it's going to negatively affect a lot of businesses, those small businesses.And I think we need to be cognizant of that, especially in this economic environment. So and I just think there are other ways to deal with the school issue.Thank you, Mr. Desai. Councilmember Vela, briefly.Yeah. Just really briefly. It's not it's not for I for companies that bring in more than 3 million it's for commercial properties valued at 3 million or over. And I just want to add that this isn't more taxes, this is taxing everyone, the specific taxes on a relatively few specific people.And it will just it's basically 92% of the revenues generated are going to come from just 10% of the properties in the state. So I just think that those that those facts are very important.Thank you. And with that.I'd like to move the approval.Okay. We've got a motion and second move by Councilman Vela, second by Councilmember Odie. Quick, Miss Henry, before they take it away.Well, I was going to make the point that Councilmember Vela just made that such a large portion of the revenues is coming from a small portion of the commercial properties. But the other point I wanted to make to the general public, and I apologize for not doing this beforehand, is that properties right now are generally re-assessed whenthey're sold. And so the assessed value is less than the market value for commercial properties. They're sold on average every 30 years. For residential properties, they're sold on average every six years. So you can definitely see the disparities there.And that was all I want to just mention.Perfect. Thank you. We've had a motion. We've had a second.

I bring this forward on behalf of not only my colleague, Councilmember Gonzales, but also all those of us who are parents of kids in public schools. The two of in front of voters this February present a unique opportunity for us to continue our decades long partnership between the City of Seattle and the school district and itsboard of directors on complementary investments. And the investments that are in front of voters this February are critical ones. Not only do we have a very, very long list of capital investments that would transform and reconstruct several schools throughout the city.But also we'll make investments in nearly, if not every single school in the city of Seattle. But in addition, the operating levy, commonly referred to as the PTA levy, also has a set of critical operational investments that are necessary for all of our students to excel in all of our Seattle public schools.So there's an ongoing partnership between the city and the school district, I think is a critical one, and I'm super excited to see this ambitious plan on the ballot and looking forward to voting yes myself.Very good.Councilmember Becky Shaw, thank you so much, Mr. Johnson, for your leadership on this. And I'm wondering if you could just hold up that map and the back side of it. There are no.Further people can.Give it to you. Thank you. So what I appreciated about this map, and I'm not sure that we can even begin to have it focused from the Seattle Channel, but this is the number of schools that will be aided by this particular levy.And the back side of it identifies, I mean, almost to the dollar. What kinds of things will be done at each elementary, middle school and high school? So I know that there has been some controversy around this. People are saying, well, how come that the McCleary decision didn't take care of it?Well, then it clearly didn't. McCleary decision didn't take care of it. And so for us to continue to have the great air quality public school system that we want, we need to support this levy. And I'm happy to be doing that.So thank you for bringing this forward.Thank you. Councilmember Herbold, thank you.And I did just want to speak to some of the controversy that Councilmember Bagshaw alluded to. There was a Seattle Times editorial last week that I made some inquiries about. They had to two contentions, one related to the size of the operations levy, and the second related to concern that it would be the levy would be underminingsort of the basic tenet of McCleary, which is to make sure that there is there there isn't unequal funding in school districts across the state where cities with school districts and taxpayers who are willing and able to fund basic education are able to do so more plentifully than other school districts.And what I learned from my inquiry is that it is true that the size of the operations levy, the request in the levy itself is a different number than what they can currently be legally collected. It is in excess of the legally authorized collection amount, but that doesn't mean that they're going to be able to collect allthat money. The plan is, again, and I think this is very consistent with the intent of McCleary. The plan is to go back to the state legislature this year to increase the amount that can legally be collected. Under state law.Thus maintaining that strong commitment that we have to make sure that different school districts across the state are not put in different positions depending on whether or not those particular districts are able to to pass. LEVY So in in in essence, increasing the the collection amount gives the Seattle Public Schools some some flexibility because by asking forthe additional capacity now, they don't have to go back if the state law is itself changed. And then the other point that I think is important to note that there was a question about the use of the dollars and again, whether or not the use of the dollars is consistent with the legislative decisions made in the legislaturelast year. And I think it's important to take note that the State Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction approved the Seattle Public Schools plan for the operations levy and took the position that it is, in fact, consistent with state law.Thank you.Thanks for those comments because my HERBOLD, any further comments? If not, we're going to move to public hearing any further comments. Okay. So as required by law, we have to sign up sheets for Proposition one and Proposition two.So I'm going to. Call you out in the order that you sign it. Sign up and we'll start off. Just one moment. Here, give me one sec. Okay. So we'll start off with Mr. Alex Zimmerman and following Mr. Zimmerman will be Melissa Pailthorpe.It's on proposition number one. I have to say she. So should I go to first and second?It's a little bit confusing, I'm sure.Mr. Chairman, I humbly apologize for interrupting. Can you start his time back, please? It may I have to sign up sheets, but the same people sign up for both. And so. Yeah. Why don't we just speak on both of them?No problem.One and two.So you're absolutely.Right. Proposition one and Proposition two.Absolutely. Absolutely right. Yeah. I'm very happy when I see something common sense, which was very unusual in this chamber. So situation right now, very simple. Yes, it's exactly what is I want explained you money need for school so exactly.Absolutely I'm not too much sure how much money this money what we have here, we're talking about billions. My experience with this board of school director. But as I come in circles as pupils, very low, primitive, not professional, we cannot give this people a chance.Operate with billion dollars. We need somebody who's have different opinion. They have same opinion like you should belong in you same principle. Like you use more money. More money in still in mind. Is this exactly what's happened? We are talking about billions and billion dollars.You know, I'm absolutely sure, like profession professional, business consultant, because I don't have speeches for couple of minutes. We have more than enough money. And now in this system, we can fix it every cent, ten times cheaper. Five times cheaper, maybe three times, but much cheaper.So this happen and happen again and again. But what this I want to talk to right now about the of our operation with money in business principle what is every business have government or not government seven under thousand idiot who live in this city deserve a government 7 billion and billion dollars.I'm very happy with this because when 700,000 idiot pay a billion and billion dollars per billion and billion dollars, a billion and billion dollars for transportation for school for every cent in got better. So I'm very happy when this 700,000 natural born degenerate idiot will be a cop and Colin Campbell like you totally in scold but I'dlike to totally because of this you look right now is a pure fascism when government together with corporation suck blood and mind you from us stop fascism cleanse this chamber. Stand up, America.Okay, these were all in line with the public now. So Melissa will be followed by Jake Ewert.Hi. My name's Melissa Pailthorpe. I'm the president of Schools. First, the organization that mobilizes the Get Out the vote campaign for the school levies. And here as a volunteer and a parent in our public schools. Thank you all for supporting this resolution.I think council member bags have pointed out that the capital levy has significant funding and improvements for the buildings across the city, which is really critical. We have a number of aging buildings. We've been working on that for a while and we have to keep working on improving those for our kids.And as Councilmember Johnson pointed out, we do have a funding gap between the McCleary solution and what we're able to raise locally. So our E.P.A. levy this year is absolutely critical. And as Councilmember Herbold pointed out, we are asking for additional authority, knowing that we would have to, in fact, have legislative action to collect on that.Seattle is not unique in that several districts are taking this tack because we don't want to have to come back to voters and ask again and spend more resources and time on that. So thank you for your support for our 53,000 kids and appreciate all the work that you're doing.I would also like to remark that this does go hand in hand with the fact, Larry, we need both pieces to make this work in our city. So thank you for that as well. And I want to apologize on behalf of Greg Wang because he had to leave, but that was the point that he wanted to make. So thank you.Thank you, Jake. You are.Hi. My name is Jake Ewert. I'm a volunteer with schools. First you just heard about I'm also a parent of kids in the Seattle Public Schools. I've got a second grader, a kindergartner, and a little guy will be in kindergarten soon.These levees are really important to me, very, very important to the city. The Capitol levee is obviously important to improve and replace some schools in the operations levee. Obviously important to bridge the gap between all the improvements and funding the state has made and the money that public schools need for services.Now, a lot of folks have been moving to this town and will continue moving here, interested in putting their kids in Seattle public schools. It's really important that we continue investing in them. I know one thing about the money that's going to be collected, every single dollar is going to be used to support our kids.So it's a great investment. I urge you to vote yes. Thanks very much.Thank you. And thanks for letting us know Greg was not here, but we did have him, his and Greg on the same street. And Greg, thank you for all the work you're doing. Okay. Seeing no further speakers signed up to speak either in favor or opposition to the resolution.The public comment period for this time will be closed.

And we're a little rushed on time. If we can, we would like to take action on this today.But if not, we will do so at our June 15th. Go right ahead, Auntie. Good morning. Andy McLellan. Council Central Staff. Just as a note, Cherie Sue is the lead stock of this item, but I will be presenting the verbal staff report this morning.I mean, as you noted, we also have staff in the departments, but options on the call materials for this item begin on page 22 of your packet. Proposed Ordinance 2020 201801 Placed on the November 2022 election ballot, a charter amendment proposal to move elections for County Executive, County Assessor, County Director of Elections in County Council members fromodd numbered to even numbered years. Each of these county positions was most recently elected in an odd numbered year for a four year term ending in in either 2023 or 2025. For each position, the proposed charter amendment would change the following term only to a three year term 2023 through 2026 or 2025 to 2028.And then move to move to an even your schedule, subsequent terms starting in either 2026 or 2028 would again be four year terms. A little bit of background. Every November, the state holds a statewide general election. By default, county officer elections are held in even years, with an exception for counties governed by a charter that provides forideal elections such as King County elections for the county executive assessor. Director of elections and councilmembers are outlined in Article six of the King County Charter. As we've, as I mentioned before, they are currently elected in odd years.The remaining county office, the prosecuting attorney, is a position created by state law and is elected in even years. The Elections Department administers elections countywide for federal, state, judicial and local positions, along with state and local ballot measures.Table one on page 24 summarizes the type of elections currently administered and even at odd years of the seven home rule charter counties in Washington, Kingston, Home and Whatcom hold elections for county officers in odd numbered years. Moving to the analysis section, beginning on page 25, as we just as I just noted, but in table two summarizeson page 26, the proposed changes to the election schedule under the proposed Charter amendment, both for the county executive and council members from districts one, three, five, seven and nine. These were most recently elected in 2021 for a four year term to end in 2025 under the proposed Charter amendment.The next term would the term would change the following term only to a three year term from 2025 to 2028. Again, after that, the terms would be four years for the county assessor, elections director and council members from districts two, four, six and eight.These were most recently elected in 2019. Under the proposed charter amendment. The next term would change for a three year term for 2023 to 2026. After that, the terms would again be for years, the remaining county elected office prosecuting attorney was most direct elected and most recently elected in 2018 and serves four year terms.The proposed ordinance also repeals some sections that would no longer apply. Summarizing some of the cost considerations in this can be found on page 27 of your packet. Operational costs election staff indicate that moving county elect county officer elections from odd to even years would not directly result in operational changes or costs to department, executive or electionstaff believe it's unlikely that the proposed change would impact turnout and even are odd years and therefore unlikely it impacts staffing and costs. The only potential, a potential operational change or cost would be if moving it to even year elections resulted in two page ballots.Administering two page ballots would incur additional costs for printing, storage, space and staff time to sort through the boxes. Data does not show that moving to giving year elections would necessarily result in two page ballots. There is a table on page 27, table three, that summarizes the total number of ballot items in recent elections.The exact number of contests on a ballot given ballot would vary with respect to the allocation of election costs among county, state and local jurisdiction. Election costs are divided proportionally across jurisdictions appearing on a given ballot, the allocation of cost would shift.Is moving county officer elections to even years changes whether or not the county appears on the ballot. Turning to your direction or directing your attention to table four on page 29, this shows the potential fiscal impact if county officer elections had been held in even years instead of on.Moving County office elections from odd even years when occasionally have a fiscal impact to the county, and even years if the county would otherwise have no races or ballots or other measures on the ballot and table for these would be highlighted in blue.If the county does not run a ballot measure in odd years, local jurisdictions may see an increase to their election costs, since there would be no county races or measures. Since 2009, there have been three elections where holding county officer elections in even years would have increased cost to local jurisdictions.The 2009 primary, 2011 primary and 2015 primary elections in table four. This is highlighted in orange. In the in these odd year elections, the county did not run a ballot measure and only ran county officer races. If county officer races had instead been held in even years, the county would not have any races or measures on theballot. Additional costs would have been passed along to the local jurisdictions. The cost to the county with the increase in the cost to the state would increase in this case. I will now discuss some of the potential policy considerations.This begins on page 30 of the open reading packet. Low voter turnout over the last 20 years, I can tell you have seen higher voter turnout in even number of years. There's a chart on page 30 that summarizes voter turnout or general elections in the county over the last 20 years.You can see that since 2010, the county's average voter voter turnout rate is 77% and even number of years and 47% an odd number of years. Low voter turnout data is also available from King County elections by precinct, and this is displayed in the two maps on page 31.Regarding impacts to your voter turnout based on voter turnout in other counties, data does not suggest that holding Cobb County not holding county officer elections in even years rather than odd would impact volunteer turnout. Number of races on ballots in county officer elections to even years would increase the number of races on even your ballots and reducethe number of races on all of your ballots. It is not clear to what extent voter response rates are impacted by ballot lanes, ballot position or voter interest in the types of races. What measures and finally, alignment with federal and state elections.Moving county officer elections even years would align with the election schedule would align the election schedule of these county offices with federal and state elections, which are held during even years. This means that county officer elections would take place in a different electoral context.Whether council desires, desires to align county officer elections with federal and state elections is a policy decision. Just a quick timing consideration to place this potential charter amendment on the November 2022 ballot. The last regular council meeting date for adoption as a non-emergency would be July 19th, 2022.As I mentioned earlier there, staff from the Department of Elections to answer any questions. This concludes my remarks. Thank you. Thank you very much. And excellent work. And this was mentioned, Julie Wise and Kendall Hudson from the Department of Elections are here to answer any questions.Do any of my colleagues have questions of Andy or Julie Wise who can.Vote.Hudson? COUNCILMEMBER two.Thank you. Caracol Wells. So my question is, I sort of heard a sort of reference phrase generally the state legislature considered a change like this to move a lot of these other races at a statewide level to even years.And there were a lot of legal hold ups and challenges in terms of what state law required. Did anyone do an analysis of how this might run afoul or not run afoul one way or the other of other state election laws?I'm for this. What I would need to divert to election staff, where we would have to get back to SRI or somebody would have to get back to you offline without question for the amount of analysis done. Do we have any data either of our election staff wanting to answer that question?Good morning to Chairman Reynolds and council members. It's great to be with you all this morning. Kim County Director of Elections Julie Wise. Councilmember Dunn I'll attempt to answer that question. Under RTW, county offices are up for election an even numbered years unless a home rule county decides otherwise.I know this is, I think just mentioned by Andy. So of those seven home world counties in Washington, King Snohomish and Whatcom counties are the only ones who hold elections for county officials in odd years. So I believe it does not run afoul of current RTW.Thank you. Are there any other questions? Okay. Look, so, councilman, rebels itching for a question and then this is prepared for me. Thank you. Maybe for Andy. Thank you. First of all, for the very detailed staff report and the visualizations in the staff reporter are really impactful.And I think they were super helpful. You mentioned that you looked at the number of resources that would increase or decrease if we made if the voters chose to to make this move. I did a quick count myself, and I believe that the difference in any given ballot would be between one and three positions, up or down, no more than that in any one year. Is that is that on track with what you found when you looked at it? I believe so. Again, I apologize. Sherry Steele is the lead staff on this, but I believe that is what was in every staff report table.Yes. I mean, it makes sense because you've got your council member in each vote, only has one council member and then you've got the executive and two other county wide positions, but they are not all up in the same cycle.So you would have your council member plus the executive, I believe, or you would have two other statewide positions. So and that depends on whether your council members, even district or district. But the point is when people talk about the ballot getting longer, the most number of positions that you would see added to any ballot would bethree. On ballots that routinely have between 20 and 30 plus items on them. That's without a whole lot of measures. And by the way, this this this council has been responsible for a whole lot of measures. Thank you.Thank you. Council members online and then followed by council member Jim Barnes.Thank you, Chair Wells. Thank you, Andy, for this great briefing. Can you explain a little bit more what the reasons are between the fiscal impact chart? The table four that you had provided were the reasons behind increases or decreases to estimated costs.Yes. Just give me 1/2. I do apologize and I will defer again if the election staff wants to increase. But I believe, Julie, if you would like to help, I believe it's if one is removed, there'd be costs because there's proportionately divided among the jurisdictions.If the elections were shifted and ones were removed, there would be a cost that if the jurisdiction still had ballot items on the ballot, that they would receive that reduction in cost if the counties that had one more time.But that's what I think is happening there. It's offsetting the cost. If the county would remove their ballot items from the ballot, but again, would defer to election staff on the exact date of calculations. Thank you.Julie, did you want to add anything to that?I think he did a fabulous job. But yes, it really is the cost. The cost shifting between King County, the state and local jurisdictions based off of what appears on the ballot. So, for example, let's use like a real world example here.So in 2015, primary, the city of Kent. So if there wasn't anything from King County on the ballot in the 2015 primary, the city of Kent would have seen its elections cost go up from 43,000 to about 62,000.Right. For the years that the county cost would have increased. As Andy laid out in the in her presentation and in the report, you know, the years the county cost could have increased that numbers between 1.5 and 2.5 million.But it's all about that shifting between county, state and local jurisdictions about what appears on the ballot.I don't think I'm understanding at all, but I'll ask for further clarification offline.And then I'm happy to. We have Chief of Staff Kendall Le Van Hudson, who does a fabulous job explaining it. So we want her to take a go at it as well.We're certainly happy to do that.Let's have let's do that. Is she here? I'm here. Thank you. Count for number 500. Kendall Hudson, chief of staff for King County elections. This takes me multiple times to grasp when I first started. Seconds number. It is not you.The way election costs are divided is based proportionately on the number of registered voters per jurisdiction. So Kent's portion is based on how many registered voters there are out of the total. When you add the county in or take the county away, that means a whole lot of registered voters out of that total.So the costs aren't going up in any way. They're just spread out differently depending on what that denominator is. I don't know if that helps, but we can we can go off and do it again, too, if that helps.So why would county costs go up? First of all, by reading the chart that costs would go up if we moved to odd years or mine. I mean, even years are in my misreading that.It would really depend on the year. So there are some years where the county now wouldn't have anything on the ballot. In those years, local jurisdiction costs and state costs would go up. There are other years where the county otherwise wouldn't have had something on that even year ballot, or all of a sudden the county is payinga large share of that election. So the other I think thing I didn't mention is it doesn't matter how many things you have on the ballot. If you're on the ballot, it's based on how many voters you have.So the county could have one race or the country could have five races and ten measures. The course, the question of the cost is the same.I got it now. Thank you so much, gentlemen.Thank you. Councilmember Dombroski.Thank you, Chair. Call Wells and Andy, thanks for your excellent staff report presentation. Thank you, Director Wise, for being here. Very interesting issue with respect to the turnout and the issue of ballot drop off. We know that in a presidential year, a lot of people vote in that presidential race and some don't vote for anything else onthe ballot. But usually as you go down, there's a drop off. Where would the county races appear on the ballot? These are the federal candidates or even years in Congress, state candidates, when we have the statewide elections, legislative candidates.Kind of. Where would these races appear? Other ballot questions, city races. If they were to come over.Thank you, Councilmember Dombrowski, for the question. You're correct. They would come after you got federal, state, and then it would.Be all.The state offices and then the county. And we can, of course, draft up an example of what that ballot would look like.Oh, you could. Sure, we could do that.That would be.Amazing. So I was actually I didn't know it would. So the county races would be the last on the ballot down at the bottom on the back side. Is that what you're saying?That is correct. But they would come before, right? Like if there was local jurisdiction ballot measures. And except for judicial, I think would be the very last.Okay. I don't mean to put you on the spot on this, because I.Think.It might be interesting to see see a ballot. And then since we have some counties that are doing this, of the 700 charter counties in the state, three of us, I think you said are on odd year, the other four on even.Could we have some analysis done of the percentage drop off of the county races, you know, and maybe apply that to here? I think as I understand it, the expectation is that are the number of people participating would still be expected to be higher.But I'm kind of curious as to the magnitude of that. If they were to use other jurisdictions, say the mean of the other four counties that are doing it, even their drop off on a county council or some of those are commission counties may be kind of what that would be.Okay. Thank you. And Counsel.I have one more question.Okay. Yeah.This is of great this is of interest to me. I didn't hear it addressed in the public testimony, which was excellent or in our staff. And I'm not sure if that's because it's more of a political question. But when you're talking politics, you're often talking money and we no longer have public financing in the county.We did have a program years ago, and that is a big issue in terms of access. And I'm it seems to me the cost to run an election where if if the number of voters you have to reach, it'd be higher.And I am interested in whether we could do any assessment of of that, either at the county with our independent staff or maybe maybe some of the folks who are interested outside the outside of our government could help us with that.But the issue of kind of incumbents being able to raise a lot of money and a barrier that that attracts to greater participation on the ballot is such is of interest to me as we explore this question. Thank you.Jerry. Thank you, Councilmember Perry, followed by councilmembers. Hello. Thank you. Thank you for this. For all of the great testimony and for this report, direct wise, I'm always interested in your reports. And so it's from what I'm hearing statistically, if we actually follow the data on this, that there is more participation by by a huge volume ofpeople voting on those currently off year elections when they're moved to on your elections or on year elections moved to even year elections, there is because there's a certain amount of voting in the on year elections. And then then what this what the data is saying, if I'm hearing it correctly, is that it only increases, it doesn'tdecrease, but it only increases when it is moved to the even year elections. Is that correct? Director was doing to answer that. Councilmember Perry, thank you for the question. You know, it's really difficult to predict what changes could happen with turnout.But yes, even your turnout often reaches 70, 80% in the end. But then in an odd year elections, we will see like here in South King County jurisdictions, hitting 30% turnout. So even years generally, again, are getting double what the turnout is in an off year election.And I'm not sure if that answers your question. Well, I just I'm trying to be really clear on like trying to understand this. And first, I'd love to see a ballot. That would be awesome. And maybe I need the the off line conversation that councilmembers are asking for.The question I have is, statistically, we have the statistics, I think, that show the increase in participation specifically for those that would otherwise have been in an odd year election when they moved to an even year election, either in our state or elsewhere.We have the statistics available to us, do we not? Of those that wear those ballots, then have an increased response than those of where they sit on the ballot, simply because an exponential number or a greatly increased number vote on even year elections.And by virtue of those that would already be motivated to vote in odd year elections, you already have that population. Plus you're putting in front of people who vote only in even your elections that don't often vote in odd years.So you're putting it in front of more people. So I'm just wondering about the data itself. So because we have these sort of big ideas about it, but I know that you were talking about the statistics and others were talking about the statistics.Is it possible to actually see those statistics where there's been a shift that we've been able to record? As in to say, you know, selecting those that voted that don't previously they vote only and even your election said don't previously vote in of your elections showing statistically where those folks now vote when they had the opportunity.You know for those folks down ticket the police director was. Councilmember Perry, just to clarify on the question, of course, I'm happy to get my, you know, my data from the office around this to see what sort of data we can pull out here.So I think we can definitely follow up. I'm not sure if the question is, do we have any models or examples of things that used to be an off year elections and are pulled now to the general and that we've seen a higher turnout in that.I can't in the 22 years that I've been here in elections, can't recall something where we're going to be able to identify that. But we certainly will take it back to the office and dig in deeper around that.And it sounds like it looks like, Councilmember Perry, that that was your question is do we have something that that would which would show a similar sort of change? Right. Are there examples that exist that way? Because I think that's the verbiage around this is people are saying, no, no, it won't.And others are saying yes, it will. And do we have any simple examples of where, in fact, that has been the case? I'm just curious about that. Councilmember Perry, I'm going to move on now to Councilmember Satellite previous question, because we're really getting late.We're already almost 15 minutes over our meeting time. And I want to have to thinking about did she be able to comment on her legislation? So Councilmember satellite and then councilmember about it.Thank you. Chair Caldwell's I think I'm asking something in a similar spirit as Councilmember Perry, but maybe hopefully easier data to track down in the areas that have shifted to even year elections to local level elections see the same or significantly higher percentage turnout as compared to if they were still in the artier elections.This is not a trend that we see.From some members. Actually, we can try to dig into a little bit of the data around California. California has completed sort of a recent change, which is what comes to mind with Councilmember Perry's question as well. But when we look across the state, turnout patterns across counties with even versus your county races don't show any real pattern. And turnout varies so much anyway across the state. But looking across the country, we haven't really been able to find any real valid comparisons to help us understand what might or might not happen with such a change as this.But again, happy to take it back to the awesome Team Kerry elections team to see if there's some more data sleuthing we can do here in Washington state and across the country.Thank you.Thank you. I'd like to now have Councilmember Balducci speak on the legislation. And Councilmember Bell, I think given the lateness of the time, we will defer taking action on this to our June 15th meeting so we can get the material from director wise as well.Yes, thank you, Chair. I think that's that's good to make sure that people get answers to their questions to the extent that there is available before we before we take action would would make good sense. I just wanted to say a few words about this.The this proposal came to me from some advocates in the community for who are looking to improve access to elections. It is a principle that this council has supported in a number of ways over the last several years, including expanding access to ballot boxes, including really pioneering prepaid postage for ballots that then went statewide.We have, along with our elections director and department, been very diligently committed to increasing access to the ballot box and thereby making sure that the people like us who are elected to represent the public are elected by as representative of a sample and as large of a sample of the public as possible.And so this that's what this is about. This is about making elections, continuing to make elections fair and accessible. You've heard a lot of numbers, and I know that there's a lot of desire to dig down deeply. But just at the very base level, you look at the turnout for positions in this county like assessor in 2019, where the turnout was 31% of registered voters like our elections director who we love. But who's the vote on her line in 2019 was 41% of registered voters. And then in 2018, the year before, when our prosecutor countywide position is up 61% of total voters.So you see just the number. The increase from one year to the next is in double digits. I think it was pointed out very well in some of the excellent public comment that we heard today that we we would invest in something that got us safe, two, three, 5% increase in participation.And here we're talking about 20%, 50% in some years. It's it's very compelling. But for a neighborly example, last year, in 2021, our King County executive race saw 40% turnout. The Pierce County executive, who's I think they're statutory county and therefore do elections in even years.82% turnout. Turnout for King County Council members in 2021 range between 30% and 47%. Turnout for Pierce County Council members in 2020 ranged between 75 and 85%. And you're not always going to get those eye popping numbers because it's not always going to be a presidential election.But those are the people who voted for president and Pierce County Council. They got down there to those to those lower level ballots, lower level votes. Voters who are more engaged in odd year elections tend to be older, whiter and wealthier than the general electorate that vote and they are voters more likely to be paying attention andvoting in off year elections by moving to even year elections. We would align those with these important local offices with more high profile state and federal offices that attract higher turnout by more voters and more diverse voters. Younger people, more people of color, more renters.That makes us the people who are elected to sit here at King County, more representative of the people who send us. And that's that's got to be good for democracy. So I'm going to stop right there. I guess the last thing I will say is we are by no means pioneering here.If we do this, if we put this out to the voters and the voters approve it, we will join the majority of counties in this state that have their positions elected in even years, because most states do that because they are cold states.But we will also join other charter states that do this. So charter counties, I should say. So it looks very compelling to me. I want to make sure that members have a chance to get their questions answered and that we can then hopefully move forward to ask the voters to have their say about when they would liketo see these positions on the ballot. I thank you, Chair Caldwell's for the extra time today. Well, thank you. I found Jeremiah's very compelling, and I'm glad that I also signed Spencer to this legislation. Are there any questions of councilmember ability to.If not, we will take this up at our next meeting, which is on June 15th, and we will hope to have some materials or a sample ballot that we can look at that will be provided by Director Wise from the Department of Elections.And I think this has been a terrific discussion and something that is new to all of us here at this county that I think has a great deal of promise. And I thank you, Councilmember Belgian chief, for bringing the legislation forward.Now that I'm Kirk, I know that Councilmember Von Bauer was excused from some votes. Were there any other members who were excused? Madam Chair, council member Monday about what is on the line right now. Oh, yes. Okay. Councilmember Bowen.Right. Would you like to vote on the measures that you missed?Thank you, Madam Chair. Can you hear me all right?Yes, we can, Madam Chair.Thank you. All right. Barbosa Affirmative.Okay. So for any of the votes that you missed, you are saying you about you vote now affirmatively for all of them.That's correct.Thank you very much. And did any other member miss the vote? No, Madam Chair. No, nothing. Very good. Before we adjourn, I'd like to let you know that our next regular meeting of the committee of the hall is scheduled for June 15th, at which time we will hear from a panel providing a status report on the HarborviewMedical Center. We'll also take up action on the ordinance, placing the ballot a charge, a change to our ballots to even number of years. And we will have further discussion and possible action on the reappointment of beneath the condo wall as director of the Department of Public Defense.And a preview for our meeting after that, which will be July six. We're planning now to have a panel and gun safety measures that are provided by the state, the county and other local jurisdictions, jurisdictions likely these will the panelists will be members of various departments in the county.And we will also have a discussion on what else might be done to ensure greater public safety in the question of gun use. I know that Councilmember Dan Barsky is already working on some legislation, and if that timing works out, we could take that up as well.If anybody else is working on legislation, we might be able to include that as well. So one other item that we will also hear from Dwight Daly and we will take up a motion for a discussion and possible action on that is sponsored by council members on extreme weather sheltering.And so I think that that'll be a good time to get ready for this summer. I thank you all for participating in today's meeting. And if there's no other business we are chairing.\nSummary:", "answer": "AN ORDINANCE proposing an amendment to the King County Charter to move elections for certain county offices from odd-numbered to even-numbered years; amending Sections 640, 647 and 650.20 of the King County Charter and repealing Sections 650.40.15, 650.40.25 and 660 of the King County Charter; and submitting the same to the voters of the county for their ratification or rejection at the November 8, 2022, general election."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThe Report of the Planning Land Use and Zoning Committee Clerk file 314425. Remand of the approval granted through clerk file 3143564a contract rezone application of 17th and Greenwood Avenue, LLC C Terry Zone An approximate 12,000 188 square foot site located at 7009 Greenwood Avenue North from neighborhood commercial two with a 40 foot height limit to neighborhood commercialtwo with a 55 foot height limit and a mandatory housing affordability suffix. The committee recommends the council grant the application as conditioned and the report of City Council of the City Council Council Bill 119511 an ordinance relating to land use and zoning affirming the reason approved ordinance 125640 and accepting and amending property use and development agreement ascondition as a condition of the zone approval introduced May six, 2019.Thank you very much, Councilmember Brian.Thank you, colleagues. If you recall, last fall, we we had a process where we went through this and made an approval of the contract free zone that was appealed to King County Superior Court. King County Superior Court remanded it for to address the issue of the transition that came to the committee about a month ago.In the committee, we had 5 minutes of what's the right word, testimony, I guess, from both sides, and then made a recommendation. That recommendation was giving direction to staff on how to proceed. They revised the the puta, the property use development agreement and we have those now before us today.There's the clerk file, which is the findings, conclusions and decision, and I'll talk to that first. And then the second item is an ordinance which brings in the the powder highlight just on page three of the clerk file, the what the Superior Court directed us to do pursuant to R.S. W 36.7 3.140.The contract rezoning, approval and Property Use and Development Agreement are hereby remanded to the City Council to address compliance with SM c23 .34.009 Deed two, which requires that a gradual transition in height and scale and level of activity between zones shall be provided unless major physical buffers, as described in subsection, are present in the area where thecommercial lot 287710-4100 shares the rear boundary line with the single family residential lot at 7010 Palatine Avenue North. We discussed a couple of options in committee and ultimately chose to set aside the rear lot of the lot defined there as the buffer in the findings of fact for the this click file.I want to read the second one in particular. It says The rear yard of the single family residential lot at 7010, Palatine Avenue North can be modified to provide a landscaped open space that could be integrated into the landscaped open space on single family residential lot.And then it lists a lot number, which I believe is the lot immediately to the south of it. And then in our conclusions we add a conclusion section. This is also on page four that says a landscaped open space in the rear yard of the single family residential lot of 7010 Palatine Avenue North provides a physical openspace buffer between land use, between land uses and allows for a gradual transition between the height and scale of the neighborhood commercial zone on either side of the property and the single family zone on the west side of the property.That's about all I have to say on this. If folks have questions, I'm more than happy to move forward. I should say that we'll need to substitute version two of the file for version one, so maybe I'll go ahead and move the substitution.Now let's take the substitution first. That's the easiest one. So go ahead and formally move the substitution. I guess I could take that as your form of motion informal movement there a second. It's been moved to second and you make the substitution as.Stated by Councilmember O'Brien. This is a subscription only all those in favor say I. I oppose. The ayes have it. So the bill is substituted. Cosmo O'Brien Did you have any more words to say on the clerk file or the bill itself?I do not.Read any questions for many of our colleagues on this matter. Okay. CHEERING Then I want to thank everyone for testifying and thank you for doing the committee work on this and listening testimony, I think on more than one occasion.So that being said, we will move to to vote those in favor of granting the application as condition. Please vote i. I those opposed vote no. The motion carries the application is granted as condition and the chair will sign the findings, conclusions and the decision of the City Council on the Council Bill.I will move it past council. Bill 11951. I'm sorry. Let's go. Councilmember Brian is pointing in. That means hold.Up. I believe the puta as amended. I'm looking at kettle here. Do I need to just substitute the updated puter as the attachment? So I will move to update to amend the ordinance to update the attached to the with the one that has been completed and in front of us in our packet today.Just so I'm clear before it's second and you're basically amending the council bill 119511, correct? Correct. Okay. Their second. Okay. All those in favor of the amendment adding the puta two counts. Bill 119511. Say I, I oppose the ayes have it.And now we have an amended council. Bill, any further words to say on this one? Okay. At this point I'll move to Kath to pass counts bill 119511 as amended. All those in favor say please call the roll on the passenger bill.Let's do it that way.Herbold, I. Or as Mr. O'Brien. Hi, Jacob. I Sergeant Gonzalez. Hi, President Harrell. I aid in favor and unopposed.The bill passed. I'm sure I'll sign it. Okay. We're going to take items. Just one sec. Let me get my bearings here. Let's do take the next. Items individually.

Ms.. Frick.Yes, Mayor. Members of the council tonight seems to be the night where we hopefully conclude many issues that have been undergoing analysis and debate for years on end. This is one of those items, billboards, and we're hoping to present to you something that the council, in fact, will approve tonight so that we can get this taken careof. And Amy Burdick will provide the staff report is broader.I'm still.Here.Yes. Aren't we all?I apologize for my items.So we are here to talk to you about billboards tonight. You're probably familiar with this. 2009. It goes back to 2009 where the city council adopted a moratorium. The council extended that moratorium for a year and then asked us to come back with some revisions to the billboard ordinance.We did that in December of 2011. The first reading of the ordinance was presented and approved. The second reading of the ordinance did not pass. So the ordinance failed for lack of a majority vote. In March of 2012, we did come forward with some changes to off premise advertising, which you did approve.And then in October of this year, 2013, you directed us to go back to our original language from December of 2011. We have done that. In fact, you also asked us in October of 2013 to add some language related to the ability to enter into development agreements.For.The development of electronic billboards. So we have done that. We have presented to you an ordinance. We did take the liberty of making a couple of cleanup changes in the ordinance as well. And in the past six weeks or so, we have had meetings with all four major billboard companies to discuss the changes that we are proposing. In essence, we are suggesting that conversion of billboards to an electronic format could be permitted within the city. It does involve a cap and trade program, if you will, or a take down program with the goal of removing billboards in non-conforming areas.So we have presented to you the original language. We have made a couple of changes, as I said, to clarify the findings that we would make on a copy. And we are prepared to move forward with staff's proposal tonight.I'm sure you have questions. I'll wait for them.Okay, Mr. Johnson.Well, thank you, Mayor and Miss Frick. You're right. This certainly has been a long, long saga. But we'll see what we do tonight. I first of all, I want to thank staff, particularly Amy Bodak, for your long, hard work on this item.And you democracy may not be the fastest system, but I do think it's the best because we'll end up having I think is a better product from robust discussion. So I just want you know, I think this council appreciates particularly your efforts whenever you have something that makes everybody happy, that's the nature of democracy.But I think tonight. Yeah, so that's that's pretty close to the best we're going to get. I do have one question. Miss Bodak, we had discussed about the map you had produced several times before, but I want to make sure it was available publicly and hopefully attach the item.Mr. City Clerk If possible, could you describe that map as. Modica? My understanding is this map, at least as that. Or as currently reads, shows the public where electronic billboards could be if I granted a copy accurate?Yes, sir. We did pass the maps out and we did work with the city clerk's department and the city clerk to make sure that this is attached to the agenda item. This map was originally presented in 2011 and it shows the approximate location of all 350 plus billboards within the city and our approximation of where we thinkthe billboards could go in the future. This is an approximation. We did lay out the zones that they would be allowed, and we did include a landscaped freeway buffer as defined by Caltrans to try to demonstrate what areas of the city we expected electronic billboards to occur.It is an art rather than a science because it does depend on, you know, the approval of each individual copy. So we.We.Can't present this with with 100% accuracy, but certainly our best guess.Well, thank you, Ms.. Bodak and I encourage everyone who is interested to take a look at that online. I think the bottom line is that vast areas of the city, including residential neighborhoods, are not eligible for electronic billboards.Is that is that correct? As a as a generalization?Yes, sir. That's very fair to say.All right. Well, with that, I would like to go ahead and move the staff recommendation the second.The O'Donnell.Secondary.There's emotion in the second Constable Lowenthal.No past. Thank you.Councilmember Neal.Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. Miss BODETT, could you explain subsection C to me, please? Specifically 21.5 4.170.Yes.I think his.Page. Yes.So what we have defined under this ordinance, all billboards that don't have a copy would be considered non-conforming. That was not our intention. We are trying to define certain billboards as being non-conforming and then allow for the opportunity for other billboards to be converted.So the the the billboards that fall under this category, are you familiar with them? I believe it's like five of them. Are they conforming now? Are they are they conforming under our current?Well, no.They're not.They would be non-conforming.And.Have we.Had. But they're conforming under state law, correct?No.They would not be. If this is a defined landscape buffer under Caltrans definitions, they would not be able to build a billboard there now.Okay. So these particular billboards have been grandfathered in and they've been there for so long that. Have they had? I guess what I'm getting at is have we had complaints and challenges in regards to these as far as people trying to a requesting that they be removed.I'm not sure.What.Five billboards you're referring to.My understanding is that they are loaned the the four or five freeway.So there are a number of billboards along the four or five freeway and there are a number of electronic on-premise signs along the four or five freeway that the two electronic signs that you see on the four or five freeway are not considered billboards.So we do not have any electronic billboards today in the city. We only have static billboards. So we don't have experience in dealing with complaints related to electronic billboards because we technically don't have any in the city.Well, I would like to move a friendly amendment on this, if we could. And just as we strike subsection C 21.5 4.17 on.Okay. There's.Well.There was that. I'm sorry. I wanted to clarify that, actually. Was that a friendly amendment or without a substantive motion?No friendly amendment.Okay. Well, that's where Johnson.Thinks by spirit. Well, I guess I'd ask staff. Describe why. What is section C? What does it do? And what was staff's intention in placing subsection C? And finally, and I usually only ask three part questions, I apologize, but what would be the effect of removing subsection C?So we have defined existing billboards that are built within landscape buffers to be non-conforming, meaning that they would not be able to be built today. They're they're essentially illegal or non-conforming. We have established a series of criteria to define those billboards which we would allow to be converted, and those billboards which we do not believe should beconverted. The removal of this section would negate the purpose of the ordinance, which is to remove non-conforming billboards. I'm sure you had more questions, sir. I can't remember them all.Oh, yeah. So based on what you're saying is the purpose of the substantive C is to provide an incentive for the billboard companies to participate in the cap and trade and convert to electronic or.In a sense, yes. You know, there are a number of billboards throughout the city that we believe should not convert to digital. And we believe that by complying with the Caltrans standards of not allowing an electronic billboard within the landscape, buffer is one of those situations.There is one caveat where an existing billboard within the landscape landscaped buffer along the four or five freeway could convert. And that is if they acquire credits through Caltrans, which a number of the billboard companies already have, and that Caltrans would allow them to use their credits that they've gained from another location in the state and applythem to the Long Beach location. Our ordinance specifically allows that to occur within the landscaped buffer, provided that they have the Caltrans credits and apply those to the Long Beach location. Otherwise, we are treating this as a consistent land use.We are not segregating one company versus another. We are looking at this as as one land use issue across the board. We have determined, you know, that there is a number of of non-conforming billboards within the city that that should be removed, that are in inappropriate locations.And the removal of this section would negate that purpose.I will given staff's opinion that removal would be against the integrity of the statute and given the fact we've talked about for three years. Mr. Neal, I respectfully not want to take that amendment.Are you making a substitute or are you just leaving it as is for now?I think I'm just going to leave it at that.Councilman O'Donnell.I actually James Johnson asked my question. So I'm I'm ready to hear from the public.Okay. So, you know, other counties coming in right now, I'm going to open it up to public comment. Please step forward if you have a comment.Good evening, Vice Mayor, council members. I'm Ron Miller, executive secretary of the Los Angeles Orange County Building and Construction Trades Council. We stand in support of this amendment. We have an agreement with a couple of the billboard companies that will put a lot of our folks to work, taking down the illegitimate billboards and putting up whatever newelectronic billboards transpire, which are going to put men and women from your community to work. So that's the bare basics of it. So we stand in support. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker.Well, it's a little redundant because there's an agreement that we're going to have electronic billboards. But I would like to give my advocacy that, Proposition two, that we should have electronic billboards. Even if it sounds superfluous for me, I would say it first of all, it's an abridgment a speech.Not to have billboards, to make announcements. And Mr. Parkin might want to address himself to that problem after I'm finished. Would it be in the of the speech not to have them? I would also say that it beautifies the landscape.Really. It's like having lights on a Christmas tree with gifts. It because. Beautiful. Well, having a picture framed. Yeah, it's beautiful. Surely the Japanese and those in Las Vegas have learned this virtue. And that night, their streets are left with billboards that are quite beautiful and gorgeous to behold.Also, it would be to our advantage to see to for the rest of the public to see that we are really concerned with business and what makes business works. These billboards would be advanced and also be business oriented.They provide information. They are a virtue, not a defect, like some socialists might maintain who put a damper on business to attain the so-called public good. Well, it isn't. I would also like to say that this is a cue, Mr. O'Donnell, that when I spoke earlier about about having an advertisement film for a production company, film productioncompanies might be amended to say that a film should be made a half an hour film made but provided with things that would make it memorable. Like Sharman and Champagne, they'll enjoy it and also go along with enlightenment in that regard.Oh, and what is conformity? What is a billboard? It doesn't conform.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Good evening. My name is Tim Fox. Same with CBS Outdoor based in Los Angeles. Thank you for your time. First, I want to thank staff. As you guys know, it's been a long process and a lot of work has been done.We have a few concerns about the proposed ordinance as it is. I have a letter I'll submit for the record, but the brief synopsis of it is the first issue in table 54 one. I believe the correct was there are some spacing issues that we would like to address.The industry standard in most cities is different than what is stated in the table, and we think that if we could address that and bring in an industry standard which would be approximately 500 feet between what we call posters and a thousand feet between digital signs.It's basically the Caltrans code, but it just maybe a little more clarification. And there is also no spacing entered in one of the boxes if you were going to take an existing sign and expand it. And there was another provision within the proposed ordinance that we're concerned about where if a our company is one of them, wedo have inventory within the city that we could use to take down and build digital or convert. There is a requirement that all of the removals have to occur before we're allowed to build a sign. We would hope there would be some discussion on the ability to perhaps build the sign, not turn it on, and then wecould do the removals just for some protections to make sure that we don't lose the rights to existing signs. I know that was addressed a little bit in the ordinance, but just maybe some more protection, that type of thing.Other than that, we're happy to move along with the ordinance, you know, and have if you have questions, we'd be happy to answer. But thank you again for all your help.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Good evening, Vice Mayor. Council members. My name is Mike Murchison. I'm here on behalf of Regency. I want to clear up some issues on the subsection that was discussed here a minute ago. The purpose and intent, as I recall from the city council three years ago, was to focus on those billboards that were in the residential communities. Subsection C deals.Strictly with freeway billboards that are within the landscape.Area of 660 feet.Nothing but that. So we're talking about very few billboards.Very few faces. In the faces that Councilmember Neal is referring to are five faces that if subsection C was.Left in, there would be deferred.Non-Conforming. Now, what does it mean when they're deemed non-conforming?What it means is, is.That you got to go through a cap and trade program.Okay. So everybody's on board with cap and trade. So 4 to 1 ratio, I'm talking about five faces. So on a 41 ratio, if I've got five faces, then I'm gone.And in fact, in that particular instance, Regency is wiped out of half of their inventory in the city of Long Beach.So are you in a.Position tonight that you.Don't want to take out one subsection C an impact half the inventory of the company here in the city of Long Beach? I don't think so. Your purpose here is to vote on an issue that has to do with the billboards are in a residential community.The ones we're talking about, the.Freeways have never been discussed. Never had opposition. No comments that I'm aware of by any residents here in the city of Long Beach.Furthermore, we're not talking about replacing them with digital.We're talking about just leaving them alone. The reason why Regency.Has these five faces.Is because they had these billboards here longer than state law. They were grandfathered in. I understand where staff's coming from. I understand the fact that they want to be on the same page with state law. That makes perfect sense to me.Unfortunately, that one sentence in subsection C will basically take half of the inventory out of what Regency currently has and does very well with.I don't think that's your intent tonight.I thought your intent tonight from the last three years of going through this was to focus on the cap and trade program in a residential area with all the billboards are in the residence and what their concerns are not on billboards that nobody really comments about that are on the freeway.So I respectfully request that you consider subsection C all over again to.Remove it and get clarification.On the specific impact of that language. It's one sentence. Thank you very much.Thank you. The public comment.Very good. You? I'm always afraid of the creeping crud. I would suggest it. They've got those. The five billboards that the previous speaker just referenced, that you put in language that if those ever do go digital. Each one will be at a cost of $1,000,000 a month.Which would flow to the city. I don't like to use digital billboards. I've seen what happened up and in L.A. and the creeping crud and I can just see in a matter of it wouldn't be too too long one.Eventually they would be coming in, marching right down into neighborhoods. So restructure the language. So you make it very clear that there exists no conditions under which any digital billboard would be allowed, be it on near the signs that it's on city property or within the city of Long Beach, whether it be near the freeway or ina city that you don't want it. But if, in fact, it does happen. Million dollars per board per month. Thank you. And if you can't figure out what to do with $1,000,000 per boy per month, let me know and I'll show you where the money can best be used.Thank you. Okay.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Good evening. Council members Victor Dela Cruz with Manatt, Phelps and Phillips on land use council to Regency Outdoor Advertising. I just want to follow up on what Mike Murchison had said. The ordinance, as it's currently crafted, has four different types of non-conforming billboards.You have the billboards that are located in residential areas, in plan development districts, all those areas where we don't want billboards to. There are the billboards that are on local streets exactly where you want to remove the billboards from.Three There are the landscape freeway segments, the areas that frankly, nobody cares about. These are freeway oriented billboards that don't disturb residential neighborhoods at all. And then four, there are those billboards that are on rooftops. Those are the non-conforming signs we would like to do is to have subsection C removed because those particular billboards, one, don't disturbany residential neighborhoods and don't hurt the integrity of of our residential neighborhoods. Second, it's important to realize that these billboards on the four or five, we may talk about the integrity of the ordinance and the fact that there's somehow going to be a strong incentive to remove billboards on freeways to participate in the cap and trade.I can assure you that no billboard company is going to remove a single freeway off of the 405 as part of this program. They are way too valuable. These are the cream of the crop of the billboards. And unless if subsection C is not removed, what you would be forcing Regency to do is to take down itsfreeway, its freeway oriented signs on the four or five, its most valuable signs in order to be able to participate in the digital program. You may recall that at the last council meeting you directed staff to include development agreement language for those companies that could not participate in the cap and trade program.And we'd like to thank staff for working with us to incorporate that language. That language is in there. But unfortunately, because of subsection C, we would be precluded from participating in the development agreement process. What we're asking for is if we want to convert any of these billboards on freeways to digital.We would then go through a whole process of planning, commission planning, commission review, city council review in exchange for significant public benefits for the city and revenue. And you could choose to approve those digital conversions or not. We would still have to go through a very long process, but we would just ask you to remove subsection Cso that Regency can participate in this program, just like all of the other billboard companies. Thank you very much.Thank you. Councilmember DeLong.One of the speakers talked about the the permit process and when the the non-conforming signs would be taken down. And could staff elaborate on that?Certainly we did realize that this was be an issue the last time around, and we have tried to write the ordinance that would provide some level of protection to the to the applicant. We do have a requirement that when they get a a C up and a copy is being processed, the Billboard company has to provide uswith a list of non-conforming billboards that they intend to remove as part of this cap and trade program. They get to determine which ones they want to put forth in terms of which ones they want to take down.As a package that would be part of their c u p permit. But in order to assure that a billboard does not get constructed or converted, we are going to require that the removal does happen of those non-conforming billboards.The assurances that we have provided is that the c u p, the one year vesting period of the c p is delayed or extended until such time that that bill, that last non-conforming billboard is removed, that they still have a full year under their c p to implement the electronic billboard.There is grave concerns that allowing somebody to essentially build a house and let them move their furniture in, but don't let them live there that they're going to, you know, end up living there when our back is turned.So we do have grave concerns that if we structure it in any other way, that the billboard company will effect effectively flip the switch and that the electronics will commence and we will have no authority to to get them to remove the non-conforming billboards.Okay. So but we're in the process. Do the old billboards come down.After they have been granted ACP by the Planning Commission? They apply for a demolition permits. They can certainly get building permits plan checked, but they don't get to have the building permit for the new electronic billboard until after the demolition of the old billboards are complete.Okay.But I guess my concern is maybe if I own that business, I wouldn't want to turn off all my revenue for X period of time before I had the new revenue coming in. And I guess what I like to propose and you can tell me what truck and would you see is I don't know why we wouldn'tdo it. More like a certificate of occupancy that will let you build the new board. But you can't occupy you can't activate it until the old billboards are down. And while I understand your concern that somebody might violate that regulation and turn it on, that we need to have a strict enforcement penalty, and I know it's athousand bucks a day or, you know, do something that's extraordinarily painful, that if you turn on that sign before the old ones are removed, it's going to cost you dearly.I'm pretty sure we would not have a high enough citation that would accommodate that. $1,000 a day to an electronic billboard is really not a lot of money. Our issue is, you know, consistency with how we treat the building code across all land uses.We do not allow occupancy until all requirements are met. And so we are very firm on this. This position.Well.Kind of give me give me an example of that. When you say what's like a billboard, do you tear something down? And then you might have multi-month before you put something up and you lose your revenue in the meantime.Give me an example of something that's similar in the city.I'll give you an example of somebody who's not supposed to demolish a partial house in a in a while. They're waiting for their local coastal development permit and they still do it.Yeah, but they didn't lose revenue. In the meanwhile, we enforce them.Maybe they had rental income that that they ended up kicking out and then we've extended and delayed the process.Right. But that's completely different. That's that's where that building owner chose illegally. But that building owner chose to to move those tenants out and lose revenue. Show me an example where the city is insisting you lose revenue off the existing operation for a period of time.I don't think it's an issue of revenue for us. It's a it's a the perspective of you don't get to have the vested right or the opportunity until you have complied. And so there's there's no creative way that we can come up with to demonstrate that they're going to comply and remove their billboards in order to getthe right that we are granting them for the electronics. It is a privilege that we are giving them to to allow them to convert to electronics.I think that's the difference between us. You know, when you say you don't look at the revenue perspective, you're not looking at it from the customer's perspective. They're a customers of the city. So I think we do need to give them the ability to get everything up and running, but they cannot turn it on.They can't occupy it right until they meet that. And then there needs to be some kind of a stiff penalty or some other action. And maybe, you know, we start a process, we have to take it down or something.But I don't know. I think we get here in a different way. And I also think that if a a billboard company tries to challenge us, challenge us and do something illegal, they're going to find it very difficult to continue to do business in the city of Long Beach.So let's let it percolate a little more. But I'm going to come back with a substitute or friendly amendment on this issue before we close it out. But could you also comment on the item regarding the number of feet, the 500 feet, a thousand feet that the gentleman referred to and what our requirements are and which onesare both confirmed to the state?I'm sorry, sir, can you repeat that?So one of the gentlemen talked about that. I guess in the language, it's 500 feet, maybe for some billboard, a thousand feet for a digital billboard, but that doesn't conform with what state code is. Can you elaborate on that?Or if not, we'll have the gentleman come back up and asked the question again.We're actually being more liberal than the state. We are allowing boards within 300 feet.Okay. Could you the gentleman that's a question for you. Could you come back up so we could resolve that?Tim Fox, CBS Outdoor. I'll read the paragraph I put together. Make it hopefully more clear. Sorry about that. Another issue of concern is in table 54, dash one as it relates to spacing between billboards. The city's proposed spacing is a minimum of 300 feet or Caltrans requirements as they are on the freeway.Most, if not all, cities require a spacing distance of 600 feet between larger non digital 672 square feet, what we call bulletins, billboards and 300 feet minimum, sometimes 500 feet, depending on the city. Between the smaller, non-digital, 300 square feet or less.Billboards. Those are called posters. There is also no spacing requirement noted for the enlargement of an existing sign, or at least the way we interpreted the the the table. We would propose that the city adopt the spacing of 600 feet between non-digital billboards, between the size of 300 to 672 square feet, which is a poster in abulletin. A minimum of 300 feet between billboards, 300 feet or less, and a minimum of 1000 feet between all digital billboards. That's just a proposal.So how does that compare to what staff are recommending at other cities?Again, on on on the electronics, we are much more liberal. We are suggesting a minimum of 300 feet. The speaker just said a thousand feet.Okay.So I still believe that we're being more liberal.Okay, I'm finished for now. But maybe before this comes back, I say I'm going to ask for either friendly or a substitute to address the the permit issue. So perhaps you could give some thought to see if there is any other approach that might be satisfactory to both of us.Thank you.Councilor Johnson Well, thank you, Vice Mayor, but one of the speakers had mentioned about the non-performing billboards along the freeway and the desire to keep them static. If there were a static billboard along a freeway and the ordinance were to pass as proposed.Would that still be allowed to exist?Correct. It would be allowed to exist in its current state, and if the company wished to convert it, that would be allowed if it if that company had Caltrans credits.Okay. So basically illegal non-conforming, it.Would remain illegal non-conforming that would be allowed to remain in its static position.Okay. Thank you.Controversy.Gypsy But I think in following that up, if I understood Mr. Murchison, I think the issue is the the face requirement. It's not just that they should be allowed to continue there, but maybe if you clarify that a little bit more about when he mentioned five, five faces and that if you were to convert, that you lose, is that correct? You lose your inventory. That doesn't make sense. That's not seems to be our intent.Our intent is to remove non-conforming billboards throughout the city. We did not look at one company's inventory over another company's inventory. We kept this at a very neutral level where we did not get into qualifications and scenarios of what billboard would be converted and what building would not be converted.We did instead look at opportunities and granting the privilege of converting to electronic. There is a mechanism for all billboard companies to work with the other billboard companies to remove non-conforming billboards within the city. This ordinance does not limit a company from only removing nonconforming billboards within its own inventory.In fact, it it provides an incentive that when all nonconforming billboards are removed, the conversion is at a 1 to 1 ratio instead of 8 to 1 or 6 to 1 or 4 to 1. So we do stand by the position that this company in particular could continue to maintain its static billboard on the four or fivefreeway. It could continue to pursue conversion through the receipt of Caltrans credits. And if it wishes to convert to to electronic.Keep that can you or Mr. Chair if we could have the individual who brought that up, could you clarify what their concern focuses on about the five faces and, you know, obliterate the inventory? And I understand that we're not focusing on a particular company, but I think when a business comes and says, if we do this, welose our inventory.So I do not believe that this is the only company that would be required to remove billboards in order to get the benefit of electronics.I didn't suggest that. But could we just get clarification? I mean, does that that's kind of an onerous thing to be presenting to the councilman? I need to understand a little bit more before I take a vote.I'm going to go and have customer ships. If you can, please answer the councilmembers question on that.Sure. So Regency has nine total billboard structures in the city, and they're all on freeways. All of the other companies have significantly larger inventories, but their billboards are, to a great extent, located in residential neighborhoods, on local streets, precisely the sorts of billboards that the city wants to come down.Relatively speaking, the terms that the value of freeway adjacent billboards verses the value of billboards that are located on residential streets where you don't have nearly as much traffic. It's it's it's it's apples and oranges. So if if subsection C were to remain Regency in order to convert one of its billboards to digital would have to takedown four of its extremely valuable billboard faces on freeways. And those billboards don't really bother anybody because they're not in residential neighborhoods. And if I recall correctly, when stat when staff was asked to include a development agreement option, it was precisely to deal with this situation and the development agreement.Language right now allows a company to negotiate a development agreement for digital conversions if it can show that it is infeasible for them to take down enough nonconforming billboards. Unfortunately, because of that, because of that language, if if if our billboards on freeways are deemed non-conforming, then Regency might be in a position where it won't be ableto negotiate a development agreement. So all we're asking for is the ability to participate in the digital conversion process by coming to the city, because it isn't feasible to take down our structures and we would negotiate a certain dollar amount and other community benefits as part of that development agreement that would go through planning commission and citycouncil review. But does does that does that make sense in terms of.No, I understand that. And my my understanding I misspoke. I thought the council had asked staff to see if there was a possibility of being able to do that in lieu of coming up with some kind of cash in lieu of having to take them.We do have the ability and it is written in here to enter into development agreements. We do not set the negotiated positions because that would be based on individual negotiations of a development agreement. It is not an either or situation.You can't just walk in and ask for a development agreement in order to convert to electronics. You have to demonstrate, as Mr. de la Cruz mentioned, in feasibility to convert to electronics because you don't have enough inventory or because you are unable to come up with a cooperative relationship with somebody else who may have a lot ofinventory. Those are all legitimate grounds for determining that it is infeasible for them to come to do additional takedowns. And so we do include language that allows them to enter into negotiations, but does not but does not guarantee, you know, a development agreement based on on specific parameters.We awareness park and other cities that have done this. Is this is this the framework in which they've handled this situation? That's my first question. Second question is, how many other freeway billboards are we talking about in the city?They're talking about, I believe, nine.We do have we are familiar with a number of other cities that do have development agreements for billboards. Each of them have their own unique terms because they are, you know, specific to those cities. West Hollywood industry are a couple of those cities.We do have I want to make it clear that there are nine structures that Regency owns, but there are 15 phases. And I think that that's what Mr. De La Cruz was referring to, that he had five places on the four or five, but I think that only equates to three locations.There are.According to this map, you know, probably 20 billboards within the freeway landscape by far along the four or five freeway that would be potentially impacted.So help me on that. So for these other entities, if they were to want to convert, they could take their inventories in other parts of the town and take those down and then convert along the freeway to electronic.But correct.No. Along the 405 freeway, no. Along other parts of the freeway, like the 710 freeway where there is no landscape buffer. Yes. So we are talking about 20 billboards that exist in a legal non-conforming state right now. And so none of those 20 would be allowed to convert to digital along the four or five freeway, but theywould be allowed to remain as nonconforming billboards. And and, you know, and they would also be allowed to convert to electronics through the use of Caltrans credits.And just to add to that, if if we take these billboards out of the equation, I think one of the important things to understand is what is. So let's picture the future of the that the billboard landscape in Long Beach right after this ordinance is passed.What's going to end up happening is that all of the billboard companies will do a will will take down their significantly less valuable billboards on residential and local streets. And you're going to see applications as part of a cap and trade program to convert the billboards that that are not in landscaped areas into digitals and regency wouldalso like the opportunity to be able to do that. And the only way that the only way that it would be able to do that is if if if those billboards that it has right now are not factored into the calculation of what is non-conforming only for purposes of removal.Because of the ordinance, the billboards would still be non-conforming under the ordinance. We're just address addressing subsection C for purposes of removal, which leads to the question of whether a billboard company would then be able to negotiate a development agreement.So it doesn't really it doesn't really radically change the equation at all.I think I think it conservatorships go very.Quickly when I'm understanding from this photo it does not preclude them coming to try to negotiate. That seems to be the crux of the question. Does that subsection preclude them from negotiating with the city or does it maybe the city attorney can opine on this since you wrote it.They have to demonstrate technical enforceability in order to come to us for a development agreement. So that means that the non-conforming billboards, you know, are infeasible for them to remove regardless of who owns it.Yes, but have we defined what their responsibility includes in terms for an argument?We have not. We have been very, very careful about being very narrow in in what, you know, what we're putting in there for in terms of terms for a development agreement.And again, I want to clarify, though, that they would be, Mr. Mayes, that you can address because that they would be able to negotiate with the city, obviously, considering whether or not they can make an argument about enforceability.The difficulty they had and I think this is what Mr. De La Cruz has articulated trying to articulate, is that they would have a non-conforming billboard in place. And the overall arching goal of this ordinance is to remove non-conforming billboards.If the current language remains, they could come to the city and try to negotiate with a development agreement or for a development agreement. But we would say you have a non-conforming billboard that you can remove. So how? There's nothing that would preclude them from removing it.So how do they demonstrate in feasibility? It wouldn't simply be because it doesn't make economic sense for them to do. It would have to be something more. And what the ordinance envisions in feasibility to be is a situation where a company simply has no.For instance, if a company came to the city and had no billboards in place, obviously they have nothing to take down. So they could demonstrate that it would be infeasible to for them to participate in cap and trade so they would be eligible, presumably to do a development agreement if they did not have a number.Let's say the number is they need to remove six in order to participate in cap and trade. If they said to us, yeah, but our inventory is only four, well obviously they can't remove six. So we would say, well, remove four, who will waive the other two and you can participate in a development agreement.Or the other alternative is that the ordinance envisions is that a company, this is another possibility has no current inventory. They could acquire inventory or partner with another company that has current inventory in the city to take those five down or whatever the number is they're going to be taking down.And then they could participate in the cap and trade and build a new electronic billboard someplace else. So it does provide flexibility, but Mr. De La Cruz is correct under their particular scenario. If that if the language remains the same, they most likely would not be able to participate in a development agreement because they could not demonstratein feasibility.And let me ask, is there a way that we can. Struck some alternate language that protects the integrity of the intent of removing nonconforming but understanding that we've got a smaller business entity in the city so small but a an entity that doesn't have I mean, whose inventory is restricted in that particular case, what it kind ofmakes it difficult.There's really no way to do that because as Ms.. Black indicated, we didn't look, we can't treat each company differently. Their billboard is just as non-conforming as other companies billboards along the freeway. So that really can't make that.We can remove it altogether as a requirement, which is what he's requesting. And that would what.Would that do to them? The overall ordinance, if you remove that.Substitution, if you remove that, then those billboards would no longer be considered nonconforming. And so then they wouldn't have to use that as part of the equation. They would be able to come in and say, Well, we don't have any non-conforming billboards along the freeway, therefore we want a development agreement with you.Does that make sense? Yeah.No, it does. It just it's it seems to be particularly onerous on I know, you know, singling out a business, but we have a situation because we're developing an ordinance, putting it on top of an existing situation.That is and I think that's why we put the provision in there, not just specifically for this company, but for a situation that would still allow somebody like this to participate. In other words, if they had credits from somewhere else, Caltrans credits from someplace else in the state, they could use those credits to convert that?That's correct. They could use them locally. So if you have credits in another area, they can be used here under this under this ordinance. Okay. Well.I'm going to I'm going to move on to the next council members cued up. Councilman DeLong.Two questions, Mr. Mason. You know, you've talked about a feasibility and you said it doesn't include economic and feasibility. Could it or could they say, look, this is making it 4 to 1, just doesn't pencil?I think it maybe I was too strong on that. I mean, in theory, the way the ordinance is written, it could I'm just saying, practically speaking, you know, going through the planning commission, the city council, it may be difficult to make the argument that, you know, finances alone make it infeasible, because in theory, everyone could make thatargument. But the the the development agreement section is broad enough. It's possible.I mean.Well, everybody could make that argument. I think it's going to resonate more along a freeway, high profile billboards. I mean, I do see that going to be a significantly higher value there than there would be something that's in a residential neighborhood that has a much lower traffic count, etc..So I do think there's a an argument to be made. The second question I had is so these billboards that we're discussing now to today without the without a new ordinance, but the existing one, are they.Illegal, legal.Legal, non-conforming? What is their classification?Today, under our ordinance and under state law, they would be considered legal non-conforming. They were all the ones we're talking about were all built before Caltrans implemented their landscape freeway design guidelines.Okay. And in the new ordinance, they'll still be legal non-conforming.There's no requirement under the new ordinance that anything be removed unless someone wants to participate voluntarily in a cap and trade so they can stay there indefinitely.I guess the the if it's possible to do it, the only I would like to see is, you know, the last time we talked about this, what we were desirous of is trying to get staff the flexibility of negotiating development agreements when the formula just wouldn't work for whatever reason, whether it be technical, would it be lackof inventory, whether it be economic feasibility, whatever. But to have that and then candidly, you know, we're hoping to hold staff accountable that you're going to negotiate the appropriate deal. And, you know, they're going to have to justify to your satisfaction.And ultimately the council's through a copy process that it makes sense.So and I believe that we've built that flexibility in there. The section that we'd be talking about is section 21, 54, 112. And if you have the draft ordinance, that would be on page three, that line 14.A.And it simply says in the event that an applicant, applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission and the City Council that it is infeasible to comply with the provisions of Section 2154 160, which is the removal cap and trade related to the removal of nonconforming.Or boards. An applicant shall then be eligible to apply for a development agreement in accordance with Chapter 2129, which is our development agreement section.I guess the major rhetorical question there, one, am I missing if if there is the ability to handle this situation and the proposed ordinance, I guess it's not clear to me why I changed anything.And I think what Mr. De La Cruz would say is that in a hyper technical sense, he I'm guessing he probably agrees with me that it would be difficult, practically speaking, to prove in feasibility if the only argument is I'm going to lose some money by not taking down this billboard on the freeway.That may that might be a hard sell in the community for and feasibility. And I think he wants more assurance or more certainty that they could participate in the development agreement without having to take down those billboards that have that they own specifically and adjacent to their freeway.And I guess while you can't predict the outcome, I guess what I would hope is that, you know, staff renegotiate the best deal they could with us for moving one or two or three. If it's something less than four, there's some number in there that makes economic sense for the for the business to go to digital.And yet the city has gotten the best deal that it can, you know, for us and our residents.And I don't want to speak for Regency, but I think Regency has said that they would not be interested in taking down any of those freeway billboards that they own as part of a cap and trade, even in the development agreement scenario.But.Some question.Dylan can ask a question if you'd like to.I'd like to ask that question.Please come forward.If you could address that, because clearly that would seem a bit rigid.To me if you had the ability to.You know.It's practically almost all our inventory to be able to participate in. And it's a very it's there particularly valuable billboards. But the reason I've been kind of scurrying up here and trying to get something in, which is I'm hearing that there's a little bit of hesitation to remove subsection C.I want to also propose another alternative that I think would do the job very simply through the through the insertion of some additional language. If you look at the section 21.5, 4.1 12, which deals with development agreements, it says in the event that an applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission and the City Council thatit is infeasible to comply with the provisions related to the removal of nonconforming billboards. We could add some language saying excluding the removal of billboards in landscape buffer areas, then the applicant shall be eligible to apply for development agreements.And I think that that solves the problem quite, quite, quite simply.Hello, Mr. Mays. Do you want to.Opine on that?Well, I guess it has the exact same effect of removing subsection D, so it's really a policy decision of the council. And if it's council's desire to allow those billboards that currently exist adjacent to the freeway that are non-conforming to stay, then it's just too simple to remove subsection C as it is to try and fool aroundwith the development agreement language. It has the same effect either way.I guess. You know, just speaking for myself, I mean, I'm supportive of staff negotiating a deal with that business and having the confidence and staff that, you know, they're going to extract something from those signs. And I would imagine if the company said, listen, we're not going to give anything, we're not giving a single sign, nothing.All we want is new. My hunch is staff isn't going to go for that deal. Hopefully I have the confidence and you know, if we can figure out how to direct this or they can go through the development agreement process and they still got to go through the planning commission, they still got to go through copy.I mean, there are a number of hurdles that they're going to have to go through to make their case. I don't mind giving them the ability to make the case. No more. It takes us out.But one of the things Ms.. Boda suggested is that we could change it. We couldn't do it tonight, but we could bring it back next week at second reading because you can't do this on the fly. But you could change the development agreement language to require specifically that as part of any development agreement that at least onebillboard be removed. I don't know if that meets region C's concerns. Probably not, but.Yeah, I don't. I mean, I'd I personally be concerned about a number that is as as low as the floor likes. I want to give staff some flexibility about it. I don't want to be arbitrary, but I guess another perhaps way to do it.I say you couldn't do that tonight anyways. May we pass the ordinance as it is? We've we've taken a bite at this apple every once in a while and keep working this issue for another 30 or 60 days.And if we have to come back with another small tweak, do it at that time and maybe not not try and do it tonight, since it doesn't at least I'm not sensing any consensus here of what the best move forward is, other than a desire to to be open to a change in agreement.Okay, I see a few nods there so I'll, I'll relinquish the mic, but that would be where I think we ought to go.What is motion say right now?Mr. Johnson's motion is on the floor.Can't have accountability until next year.Just briefly, I would support what Councilmember DeLong proposed just now. It's come back with that.Is if I'm saying this correctly, what we have is we have a motion on the floor by Councilman Johnson to move the staff recommendation forward, but also with the understanding that we would possibly get additional information or some options on this one piece that's in discussion right now on this on the section.Mr. Johnson, are we okay with that? And that and that additional information on this one piece could come as soon as the second reading. Is that what I'm hearing also from Mr. DeLong.Would probably wouldn't bring it back at second reading. I think what Mr. DeLong was proposing, if I understood it, was just to pass it as is, which was Mr. Johnson's motion. And then at a later date, if council wants to take it up again, as you have this time, to insert something that would give more flexibility tostaff after we had a reasoned opportunity to look at it, you could certainly amend like any ordinance amended at any time.Yeah, I guess what I see as part of this is we're directing staff tonight. You know, they come back in 30 days with a recommendation for how to tweak it again, if they have it or whatever a reasonable period of time.It's I think I think what we're doing is asking for a proactive that it would come back to us, that that piece of it is a correct.Yes, it could be a heck of a memo. It could be rescheduling through the council. But yeah, give a time certain. And you know, Amy, if you can comment on how much time you think you'd need to to address that issue.Could you give me 60 days?Sure. Thank you.Get 60 days.60 days from the effective date of the ordinance.How about 60 days after second reading?Sure.Okay.And we try it out. We actually do need to vote on this because there's the ordinance and then there's a resolution referring it to the Coastal Commission. So we will need a second vote.Okay. And I still have the other issue, Vice Mayor, but if there's other people cued up with something, go to them too and I'll come back at the end.Conservatorships keep my question would be the staff. I know it was immediately shot down, but could staff give its reasoning why, if we were looking for an alternative that you offered that alternative of, they would have to replace at least one billboard if we get some.Just quickly the thinking behind that, because I don't think we you know, it was like, no, no, we want to do that. What was the reason for that?The intent of the ordinance is to remove billboards. If the development agreement does not address that intent of the ordinance, then, you know, that really should be the basis of where negotiations start. And so we would suggest that for any development agreement that would be negotiated related to billboards, that it starts with the basis that there hasto be some removal.Right.Well, I would think that I think what Mr. DeLong said then is just a little bit more on point, and is that I think that's the intent of the ordinance is to do that. But staff should have the flexibility to figure out how that can be negotiated.I do agree with them. Also, I think that we'd all have a hard time supporting, you know, an adamant refusal not to remove any to be able to do that. So I think while you've indicated one, I think the intent of the ordinance is very clear is to remove.She removed Billboard. So I would feel comfortable that, you know, having staff, being able to negotiate what that entails and how that's done would be sufficient to follow through the intent. And if we can, Mr. Chair, just quickly, because we had this whole issue has been about them and they seem to be waving about.No, I know. As long as they have a question, customer ships keep going.What was your.Our our our big concern is just the nature of the billboard industry and what will happen if you move forward with this chunk of the ordinance and you leave us laying out there for for for 60 days. What will happen is that other companies and, you know, we all get along, but nonetheless, they will they will jumpout of leases. They will go to property, and they will go to property owners and say, we have the right to enter into into agreements with these property owners for digital billboards. Regency does not. And and that's why you know, and this goes back I think we were at this, you know, 2 to 2 years ago orso. That was the key issue back then that we were already starting to have companies come to our to to come to our properties and talking to the company to to the property owners that we have relationships with to try to jump those leases.So I would beg you to please, you know, if you're going to do it, either table it and so that you can come back with the staff report or just direct staff to incorporate the simple language that would allow that would that that would not that would not require non-conforming billboards to be a part of the equationin order to participate in the development agreement process. I think my, my key thing, Mike, when I suggested that alternative language, the language pertaining to non-conforming billboards with about freeways and landscape buffer areas, those would still those would still remain non-conforming.So the ordinance wouldn't touch that. It would just basically say that, yes, Regency may have non-conforming billboards and freeways on freeways, but despite that, they can still negotiate a development agreement. And that and that's the little that's the difference between removing subsection C altogether and just including some language that has a carve out for it for developmentagreements. That's just as you know, it's not infeasible with the exception of those billboards that are in the landscape buffer areas. If you include that little parenthetical right there, you're not changing the ordinance at all except to be able to give Region C the opportunity to negotiate a development agreement.And as some of you have said as part of that process, staff, the Planning Commission, City Council could say we want X amount of dollars where they could say we want a billboard to come down. You know, it's within the discretion of the Planning Commission and city council as part of that negotiation to come up with adeal that works best for the city.Councilmember LOWENTHAL And back to Councilmember Dillon.Just if I could ask Dave's opinion, just based on what the speaker said. The issue of getting a jump on the leases that in that open market, that could happen anywhere. I don't know that that's a situation that we're specifically creating or unfairly creating.I see that that potential exists today.That is correct. All companies have the ability today to go negotiate leases for new billboards tomorrow, irregardless of whether we come back with two weeks, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days from now. It does not preclude anybody from negotiating in the free market.Okay. All right. The other thought that I have and wanted to see your thoughts on is if there is an interest and I'm not I haven't thought this through to ensure that that doesn't necessarily happen to a company that only has five billboards or however many how many billboards are we talking about where that potential could happen, where the jump on Lisas could take place?As described any freeway location.So it's five, right?No, no. This is four new freeway locations. And so there are property owners, for example, along the 710 freeway where electronic billboards would be allowed and that do not have any billboards from any company today. And so those property owners would certainly be in a position to negotiate the best lease that they wish to negotiate with thecompany that they choose.Okay. I understand that now. Thank you.Got somebody along.Okay. So my last item is biotech. I don't know if you had a chance to give any further thought as far as when the permits and so forth would be issued for the new building. If you have an idea, great.But if not, then I'll have Councilmember Johnson either take mine as a friendly amendment or I'll make a substitute, whatever your preferences.Mike May says he has some language.Come. Okay. Mr. Bass? Yeah.Councilor went along. I would clean this language up a little bit before it came back on second reading, but I think what we would be doing would be making an amendment to section 2154 161.What page.I'm sorry. 21 116.Mr. PAGE First.Page 12.Page 12.By 19, subsection D.All right, I'm ready.And what could work is something like that again. I would clean it up a little bit before it came back. In all cases, the new or replacement billboard shall not be activated or otherwise used for any purpose unless or until the non-conforming billboards have been completely demolished.Failure to abide by this provision shall result in an administrative fine of $1,000 per day.Okay. So, Mr. Johnson, you like a friendly amendment or substitute motion?Well, I guess I'll just ask staff. What? Do you have a concern with that or what would you do?I apologize to.The city attorney, but I do have concerns about that. And so if this is a the direction that the city council wishes to go, I would ask that there be in place a cash bond for each of the billboards that was supposed to have been removed but didn't get removed before the electronics were turned on.And that cash bond to be extremely significant and that that city council can direct where that money goes if we are to collect on that cash bond.I'm open to that. Yes.Councilman, darling, I don't have a problem with where you want to go. I want to make sure the the penalties are.Sufficient to do where.You want to go. I agree.So perhaps it makes sense to just ask them to come back with the second reading or I mean, I don't know.If we have the language.I don't want to I mean, I want to be able to get to a second reading times. That's minor.So we can't do that. I don't think we can do it justice tonight, but it's not a significant enough change that we could not. If we understand what the direction is and if the direction is a significant cash bond, we can certainly bring that back to you.That language on second reading, you may want to discuss again what significant is, but we'll come up with the number that we think is appropriate and then we can debate that number if we need to.Yeah, no, that's fine, Mary, to just just make it be careful that you don't make it so outrageously expensive to post the bond that it defeats the entire purpose that nobody does it. So let's just come up with an appropriate price.I just want to state that this is a very lucrative business. The conversion of billboards to electronics provides immense revenues and is of significant benefit to all of the companies who have inventory within the city. So I don't know what your realm of significance is, but it's in my realm, it's clearly more than $1,000.You know, I would probably add a few zeros to that.When you get the bond back, if.You. But you can't make the cost of providing the bond, you know, several.Months for what the revenue.At.That point you know over the.Clearly understood we're on the.Same page. Yes.So is that a friendly amendment?Okay.Okay. So we have a we have a friendly amendment on the floor. We've had public comment. We couldn't have a vote on the motion before us. And Mr. DeLong, just to just to clarify, is part of this motion still the additional request you had made earlier, Mr. Johnson, with it coming back, that piece of it.Or no? Yes. Correct.Correct. But we gave it 60 days, etc..Okay, great. Okay. So do we have a motion on the floor? Members, who's going to cast your vote before?Excuse me, before we take a vote. And there's some confusion as to exactly what we're doing. But I think that what is taking place is it's basically a motion to approve staff's recommendation with two friendly amendments. The first would be to bring the audit, bring the report back with a recommendation within 60 days after the ordinance becomeseffective that would give the city council more guidance or more suggestions in regard to whether or not it's appropriate to remove that section. See that we were talking about removing Modify. That's one friendly amendment. And the other friendly amendment is to not require the removal of all billboards that are being removed prior to the construction of thenew billboard. But instead of that requiring a cash bond be posted in a significant amount at the time of approval, or in conjunction with the approval of a copy for each billboard that is to be removed?That is correct. Mr. WONG That is correct, yep. So. Johnson Ken, we're going to go ahead and go to a vote, cast your votes on a yes.Are we still ahead of schedule?Yes.Motion. Motion carries nine votes. Yes.We're getting we're getting close over three.The city attorney, we also need a motion on the resolution estimate.Wasn't there a second vote.On this item?Sorry, there's. We need a set. You're correct. We need a second.\nSummary:", "answer": "Recommendation to declare ordinance amending and restating Chapter 21.54, related to billboards, read and adopted as read.

Councilmember Urunga Recommendation to request city manager to engage regional stakeholders regarding the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's efforts to modernize the Community Reinvestment Act regulatory Framework.Councilman Richardson.Thank you, Vice Mayor. So a few comments on this. So we have a unique opportunity on our hands, and I want to walk folks through what this is. So in response to this investment in redlining certain neighborhoods, Congress enacted the CRT Act of 1977 to promote financial reform.CRT encourages banking institutions to meet credit needs of all communities they serve, including low to moderate income communities through decent, through investment and lending. Here's the problem. Within its 41 years of activity, the CRT has only been modified two times.Unlike the banking industry, which has undergone extensive organizational and technological changes such as interstate banking, internet and mobile banking. Current CRT regulations do not fit the banking landscape, does not adequately meet low to moderate income communities financial needs.So here's our opportunity. In April 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury released recommendations on how to modernize CRT using four categories one assessment areas to examination clarity and flexibility. Three The examination process. And four performance. Following this outline, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency entered a 75 day comment period in August to gather input from financialactors and community stakeholders regarding these focus areas. The comment period is.Extremely rare as.The C.R.A. has only been revised twice in the last 40 years. The recommended the recommended changes will shift CRT framework from a narrative based framework to a qualitative assessment, ensuring that that the CRT Act is in alignment with its original intent.Here's a few statistics to consider. So in the U.S., there are approximately 9 million unbanked households, 43 million people without without bank accounts that rely on alternative financial services, such as check cashing and payday loans. The average and annual cost of not having a bank is roughly $500 for people who rely on a prepaid debit card.Currently, the L.A. Sierra assessment area monitors all of L.A. County and Orange and Ventura Counties. However, nearly one in five neighborhoods does not have a bank or credit union. In the L.A. County area, which means approximately 600,000 residents in 46 neighborhoods across the county are unbanked.Locally, speaking here in Long Beach, nor the ninth District was the only council district without a bank, and the West Side still doesn't have a banking institution. So thank you, Councilman Rangel, for signing on in support of this.In closing, this is a critical and opportune moment for us to enhance the accountability and responsibility of financial institutions that the responsibility they have in our communities. Historically, Serra's impact on low and moderate income households has resulted in affordable housing, economic development, neighborhood revitalization and lending to the underserved.Updating the Sierra is in alignment with the city's adopted 2018 federal legislative agenda, and it's consistent with the Long Beach economic blueprint. Support of this effort advances economic inclusion opportunities and financially empowers the low income communities. That said, I want to just acknowledge this letter of support and say he couldn't be here today to express his.He sent a letter of support from Randall Hernandez, a chair of economic development. And I want to thank James Alba from City Community Development for bringing this to my attention. Thank you.Thank you, councilman. Councilman Miranda.Thank you very. I want to thank you for bringing this forward. This is an opportunity for a revitalization of our neighborhoods through improved lending and business opportunities. And I totally welcome the opportunity to grow this. Thank you.Thank you, sir. Next council. Woman mother.Yes. Earlier. I appreciate that. I was asked to sign on to this item. I'm interested in a project like this, but as I've stated, I'm really concerned about our allocation of resources. So it's hoping the city manager could tell me how many hours of staff time they think that it would take to participate at this level.From what we understand right now.We've we believe this would be a very short period of time. It simply would be to get a letter in that summarizes what our feelings are. So probably just two or 3 hours, we believe. Diana, do you agree with that?Yes.Wonderful. Mr. Richardson or Councilor Richardson, are you open to a do not exceed 5 hours of staff time?I think that is incredibly disrespectful of the intent and the opportunity we have in front of us. My district doesn't have a bank area is filled Long Beach. We have a unique opportunity to express how we feel about this.We've attempted time and time again to partner with banks and institutions. And what message do we send after item after item tonight? We just allocated the item of $70,000 for deal was Muertos. We just had a whole conversation about resources in our parks and recreation.And what we're talking about right now is simply a comment letter give putting Long Beach in a better position for C.R.A.. Here's what else I'll say. We always talk about the cities that are our size Atlanta and Miami.All of those cities have their own C.R.A. assessment area. We are lumped in with all the county of Los Angeles and Orange County and Ventura County. What that means is if a loan is is deployed in Pomona, it counts for Long Beach.If a loan is deployed in Ventura. That counts for a Long Beach. If a bank branch is deployed in Santa Ana, that counts for Long Beach. The industry wants to modernize these standards. We would like to modernize these standards.Staff is aware of this. It takes 3 hours. So, no, I'm not open to that.Well, I think that your response to my response is disrespectful. I warned your staff about this when they brought me the item. I've been very supportive of everyone's items on the agenda tonight. I gave double the amount of time the staff requested for.All I'm trying to do is, as I stated four weeks ago and as a policy that this entire council.Should always be.Tough law. This council unanimously approved.You guys excuse me. I think he was asking him and he said he gave you the answer.That's fine. Yeah. Okay. But as a response, as a policy that this council unanimously approved, that we would start to discuss and send things to committee, which I was not asking to do at this time. I'm very supportive of the item.I think that this is a good thing for us to do. But what I do not feel is appropriate is that we continue to toss stuff to staff with no controls over when, where or how and what other items are being put where.The item regarding the deal, Los Muertos was her funded item, and one of the things I'm definitely interested in for the future would be to say that every councilmember has $100,000 of staff time available to them and they can allocated as they wish.If that were the case, that would be different. But this is not the case. Currently, the cases, whatever councilmembers bring, the most items receive the most allocation of staff time to their priorities. And that's not necessarily a fair and equitable way to distribute staff resources.I'm very supportive of the item. I'm just trying to, on a consistent basis, starting last week, quite frankly, I believe with Councilmember Price's item, sending things to committee because I would like to get controls over the over prioritization where everything in the city is a priority one.I believe this is important. I believe a letter is a great thing to do. I wouldn't be surprised if staff had already crafted the letter because it is so important. If it was so important, I'm surprised that it's October 9th and the comment period has been open since August.But what I would like to say is I'm very supportive. I don't think giving double the number of hours. I'm trying to set a framework, a framework that I thought you were very supportive of when it came forward from Budget Oversight Committee.It seems like to respond to that because then those. Okay, fine, Mrs. Pierson.I queued up before the back and forth.Well, that's.What I was trying to.Say. So I know. I just want to say that I'm I queued up not to engage in the back and forth, but to say that I think it is absolutely essential that our neighborhoods have access to banking and that we as a city need to do everything we can.Myself, where I live, I, you know, my closest bank is downtown, takes me 5 minutes to get there based on lights. I understand that one is the challenge of not having banks, and two is the challenge of having predatory check cashing agencies.And so I wholeheartedly support those. And I think I hope everybody just focus on this.Thank you. Thank you. Yes, Councilwoman Margo.Is there any amount of staff time limitation that you'd be open to discussing? It's not to put a limit on the fact that we don't do it. It's more to set a standard of it's only going to take 2 to 3 hours.Why not?Councilwoman attempted on one of your items?I don't remember the tonight of every week I barely bring forward item.Councilman, there have been 16 items we've heard and in two different hearings.Correct.All of which were brought by this. Bring on someone, have a conversation in advance. You cannot legislate relationships, Ernie Hudson.You don't have the floor.Do you? Just ask me a question. Thank you. No, you just asked me, was I willing to open so that warranted response?You didn't answer the question.You just started a dialog.That's how I answer my questions.Okay.You know, I think we should have a better conversation about about how we go about this.This is a fairly.Ministerial, small.Thing.And I think we're sending the wrong message at this point.I agree.And I'm.Hopeful that the minister for small things, because.This is an approach. No, the answer is no.So to my point, the reason I feel it is most appropriate is because it is a ministerial and small thing. And one of the hardest things is that our big giant items, it's so hard to get our arms around them that we're never going to be able to get to that point.And so just as a side note, your staff were notified that this is how I felt about the item and it was discussed with them. Chief, the chief last week. Thank you.Thank you. Any more. Okay. Fine. We. Please. We've only had a public comment, so would you please cast your vote? We've already called it. There's no book. Excuse me. Any public comment? Okay. Thank you. We'll move on to develop the item 18, please.I need the vote. Okay, let's get.\nSummary:", "answer": "Recommendation to request City Manager to engage regional stakeholders, including the Gateway Cities Council of Government and the Southern California Association of Governments, regarding the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s efforts to modernize the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) regulatory framework; and \r\n\r\nRequest City Manager to participate in the commenting period by articulating the City’s vision for a modified CRA."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nSix A recommendation to accept the quarterly sales tax report for the period ending September 30th, 2014, collected during the period April 1st, 2014 through June 30th, 2014.Good evening once more. This is another report. Excuse me. All of a sudden, my ear just went. Hmm. This is another report that was carried over from a previous meeting. Well, we report to you on a quarterly basis the sales tax revenues.Now. The. It is our fourth largest revenue source and it is important that there is attention given to the various elements and various impacts upon sales tax revenues. We should also be aware of the lag sales occurring in the one quarter are not our revenues received in the next quarter.So when we talk about this, we're talking if we're talking revenues there, they come later than the actual sales and we need to be aware of that as we talk about it. Most. There we have hired HDL companies to receive confidential data from the Franchise Tax Board and to provide HDL provides various analyzes to the city.These analyzes include the year over year change by major industry group historical trends over time by major industry group historical trend for the city as a whole. Historic trends by geographic areas and the geographic areas I just want to footnote were originally chosen by the City Council and we keep adding as we see new shopping areas, newareas developing. So we may want to revisit those at some point and decide if those are really things that we want to track. The surplus gap comparison. This really shows you how much sales tax dollars alameda alameda and spend in alameda versus what gets spent in other cities.It's referred to as the leakage report. It also has county wide comparisons, statewide comparisons and a general economic analysis of the nation, the state and our local east bay. This is a one of the analysis that we receive is called the 13 quarter trend.And it shows that over the 13 quarters since the most recent 13 quarters, we are trending up and that's good news. But it also tells us that when there is an economic downturn, this is a very sensitive and very volatile piece of revenue and we need to pay attention when that starts to happen.This. The next slide tells us about the per capita sales. This is the sales tax revenue per pop, per piece of population per person in the city of Alameda. And we still have the lowest sales tax revenue per capita as other major cities in our county.And we recently changed the county, the cities that we were looking at in order to be more comparative with those that we felt had similar population sizes as well as similar shopping, not just our neighbors geographically. So we are now looking at Oakland while they have.You know, bigger population. It still is interesting to look at. Per capita what they are generating and sales tax revenue. And as you can see, Alameda is still at the very bottom.So I'm going to ask a clarifying question. In the past, have you included Piedmont?No. This is one of the first times that we've included. Did we include people I can't know?Piedmont is not included. We have.Not now. I said in the past, that was my question.We haven't in the past looked at Piedmont, but we have started getting some of that data so we can start including Piedmont as a comparison if we wish to. But it's not. Wasn't high on our list of comparatives.Thank you.Madam Chair. May I make a comment? Actually, the two cities that we're looking at revising is Albany and Richmond, and the cities that we're thinking about supplanting it with is. Um. Um.Elsa Prieto.No, not. No. Sorry. Walnut Creek. Yeah.And Pleasanton.And Pleasanton. So comparable sized cities. Comparable. More comparable median income. Because Albany is much smaller than than we are. I mean, yeah, substantially smaller. And Richmond's demographic is much different than ours.Okay, so we can have a discussion on that. Right now, I just want to leave it to our clarifying questions. Thank you.So just to reiterate that the quarterly sales tax is a lagging indicator, but it's worth tracking because it is one of our four largest revenues. And we can as you look at the written report, you see that there are geographic reports and industry reports and some other charts that are included.So we can alter those to some extent. We do have a limit on the quantity of items that we can report, but we can alter them. So I wanted to point that out to you this evening so that if you choose to look want to look at different comparisons, we can start that process.And that concludes my presentation. I'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have.And we have no speakers. Correct. All right. Member Ashcroft, did you want to start or.Thank you, Ms.. Boyer, for all the presentations you're going to do for us this evening. So I you and I'm looking at the staff report now on page two. The and again, there is a lag in the actual collection of these.The reporting follows the the actual collections. So the South Shore Center, I was surprised to see a drop of 2% over the past year because it seems like so many businesses have been added. But is this just a matter of not having the most up to date information?So remember that these are the sales that took place in the period ending September.No other way from April to June.April to June.Okay.So is that really a high sales season?It's not the holiday shopping season. Exactly.Or back to school are back. Those are the two real high points at a retail establishment that's mostly what you have at South Shore is retail rather than anything else.Okay.Generally, I see this as very positive. I realize that it is not only cyclical, it's dependent on the economy. And when consumers are feeling more confident, they are more confident about spending. And there is also. It's in this report.I believe the the fact that brick and mortar stores now have competition from the e-commerce. And yet there is a mechanism by which, yes, we are recovering.We share in what's called the county pool. So what when a a. When there is an online sale and there is no brick and mortar presence in our in our city, the sales tax accrues to the county pool, and that's shared among all of the cities in Alameda County.So we get a share of that pool and that is increasing over time.And then thank you. Which which is important for us to capture that. And then with regard to now, I'm on exhibit one and there's the per capita sales tax surplus gap comparison that you referred to. And I did also note the footnote at the bottom of this graph, the last sentence that says this The information is providedonly as a starting point in identifying potential sources of sales tax loss and should not automatically be interpreted as an expansion or levering leveraging opportunity without more detailed analysis and assessment. And the the one example that just comes to mind, because it's been discussed in the community is somewhere on this table, I do believe, is the factthat we lagged in the gas station sales of gasoline in the city. And so we've recently added a gas station as you come in from the tube. And even though I certainly remember many discussions by this body previously, it apparently didn't get out to the whole community because mostly I'm hearing complaints from people about why are welooking at a gas station as we come out of the tube? And I think there's two answers to that. One of them is Sean Roskam in of Catullus promises me that that screaming from landscaping and possibly a fence even is going to help to obscure that view a little and make it a little more palatable as youcome through the tube. But on the other hand, that's what sales tax generation looks like. We just did a couple of weeks ago the ribbon cutting at the new Safeway out at Marina Village, which is quite lovely. And already I understand we're not seeing it in this report, but that the sales tax numbers from Target that's beenup and running now for more than a year and some of the other retailers, I'm sure that Safeway is going to do a great business because it's the first grocery store that far out on the island. But this this comes with, you know, it is development.We've heard some negative things said about development, but this is part of what development looks like.To comments one grocery stores don't generate a great deal of sales tax. Most of what they sell is not taxable. It it it's hard to tell you exactly what percentage because each store varies by what they have to offer sales tax on gasoline because the price is dropping where that's going down.So it's very cyclical right now and not something that is going to really boost our sales tax revenues over the next three or four quarters, I would say.Thank you.I smell.A question. Thank you for the report. And stepping us through. It is good to have the allies to help guide. But I wanted to go back to the $313,000 that was recovered a basically to the positive of Alameda.Is that going to to stay because that business is here and now reporting here so will will get their sales tax not necessarily that number will get their sales tax. Or is that sales tax spread over a number of years and are in arrears?I'm not sure of the answer because I will have to do some research and give you an answer later.Because if I look at the total quarter. Um, and I don't know how that how that figure balances, but if that figure, if that $313,000 is part of the $460,000 from Harbor Bay Parkway, is that correct? On this is page two.Yeah, I'm not I'm not certain.But to see how that. Yes. To see how that. If that's a one time or.Is it.Ongoing or is it a we expected to see some of that continue out to. If you could clarify that in the next quarterly.Yeah, I can clarify it. And then I can tell you that typically when they find an error, they give us all of they go back as far as the beginning of the year. They give us that money and then make sure that it stays corrected from that point on.And how much are we going to get? I don't know at this point.Not going to look all the time when we were on the other end of that. Yes. Where a significant amount of money went the other way.That's true.So I think if we can make sure that we flagged that in the next report. Yes. See where it lies. That's all I have. Thank you.Member de SAC.Right. Well, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Uh, interim finance director Ms.. Borja. Really appreciate the presentation. You know, I think from the big picture of things, the reason why we sales tax is important certainly is it's one of the revenue sources by which we finance the quality of life that we all hope to havehere in Alameda. So it's important. And unlike a number of other revenue centers, the sales tax is one which you can more or less plan around in terms of how you design and strategize with regard to your built environment, but also plan with regards to, you know, what kind of business attraction, business retention this is expansion strategies. So there is there is a lot of wiggle room when it comes to sales tax generation. So for that reason, it's a right place of focus. When I look at the sales tax bar chart that you had where you have like is this as an industry and in general consumer goods and then restaurants and hotels.The bar chart where you had kind of the dash colors versus the solid colors. What's really interesting is when you look at business and industry, it's great to see that it went from $500,000 in sales taxes to a roughly slightly over $600,000.But, you know, to staff's credit, we all understand that when it comes to business sales taxes, that, you know, it is highly volatile. More sales taxes, as it is, is a volatile revenue source business as as business. The business sales tax is that much more volatile business can leave or they can maybe change their their place fromwhich they conduct the sales. So so I think rightfully, city staff is recognizing that while our sales taxes in general have increased, what has been driving that is perhaps a business to business sales tax. So on the expenditure side, just because we have sales taxes go up by what, 200,000, $300,000 on the on the revenue side, onthe expenditure side, I know that staff isn't going to bake into cake 200 to $300000 more in expenses. So so I think, you know, staff is certainly on the ball there. I think there's a lot of opportunities that I think we as City of Alameda further contemplate how to utilize our economic development manager, Darrell Doan.There's a lot of places that I think we should be excited about. So. So it is true. We're an island. And by virtue of being an island, our sales tax per per capita numbers are going to be lower than many other places.But there are places where where we can mobilize. I mean, just by bringing right speed, for example, if we have right speed, make sure that when they sell a truck, make sure that we that the sales tax comes to us.And it's and as we plan Alameda point, maybe we should look for the you know make sure to prioritize those kind of businesses. And I'm sure that city staff is as is Jennifer Ott. And as we make our early discussions with prospective and developer Alameda Partners, I'm sure they'll keep that in mind as well.But, you know, there are strategies that we can do also that are on a smaller scale when it comes to sales tax retention. You know, we've we have a lot of vacant spaces in Alameda and with with some of those vacant spaces, perhaps we can, you know, have Darrell Doan and city manager staff think about, you know, what kind of pop up strategies that we might employ, pop up retail and do that. In a intentional manner. And finally, one of the things that we need to also do is, you know, figure out ways to get, you know, residents to make sure that that they spend here and in town, you know, and when they can, you know, maybe, you know, the special dress or the special suit, you know, maybe they'll go to San Francisco or Walnut Creek for that. But perhaps for a lot of a lot of other items, you know, that they're purchasing elsewhere, they'll do so here.One final point on on grocery stores, because grocery stores are an important part of a shopping center for obvious reasons. And while they are not a sales tax generating generally, maybe 30% of their sales is is taxable. Grocery stores are important in that they drive foot traffic.They drive customers to come. And that's why when you look at all the different shopping centers that we have, practically everyone has an anchor. Anchor store is anchored by by the grocery store. So so it is an important part of an overall economic development strategy, even if even if they're not as high tech generating as a target. But final point, it's great to have target here. We need that kind of sales tax. But we also need to think and I think we're on we're moving in that direction. We think about, you know, things like the business to business sales taxes.We need to think about small scale pop up strategies. So I look at this as data that is a beginning point for a wide range of strategies, and that means a lot of exciting times with our Darrell Dunn.And we do include him when HDL comes to review the quarterly information, Darrell and his staff are included in those discussions and they have an opportunity to ask lots of questions and to secure more data. So it's an ongoing process.Thank you.And Brody.Just a couple quick questions. Again, thank you for the report. And, you know, doing all the reports today, it's a lot of work to generate this information and gather at all. So on the the geographic area, you know, where would somebody at home or someone like me sitting up here find the sales tax revenue for target Alamedalanding. Is that is that so link or I'm sorry all other areas.It's in all other areas currently but we have added Alameda landing and you'll see that in the next report.And then even if you take out the 85,000 year over year for for Target, you know, we still had some good increases. What's going on with like north of Lincoln and Webster? Do you know that was one that actually had a deal?I don't know. I would have to do some research on that. Generally, when we get this data, it's accumulated from other data. And so you have to really dig through the. All of the information in order to pin the exact where the changes occurring and why.And then on the I guess it was exhibit one, the the graph. It's per capita. So that's the total per capita. So a place like San Leandro, which has a higher tax rate, you know, would by virtue of that, have a higher per capita.If they have a higher sales tax rate. Right.So it might be helpful in the future, you know, kind of compare what the sales with the sales rates on the yeah.If if they have a general sales tax rate, they may have a sales tax rate that is to support a specific bond issue and therefore should not be reported in this. But I can check and make sure.Yes. Just so you know, we're comparing apples to apples. Yeah.So cars.Cause they do sell cars.Customers have a higher tax rate.So and I think that's an important point because when the car dealerships left Alameda ten years ago, it was a precipitous drop.Yeah, you can see it on the the green line or whatever.There you go. Yeah. Thank you.Member de SAC. Oh, I.Just wanted to quickly say to that. My understanding is Peet's Coffee is interested in Webster Street. Did I read that correctly?Yes, you did.Well, that is exciting news. I just was, especially for it. Sales tax generation and foot traffic generation activity. Thank you.We've been working on them for about 18 to 24 months. Great.Awesome, wonderful. Thank you.Clarification question.Member Ashcroft.Thank you. I'm wondering if staff could just clarify. Councilmember O.D. asked where we would find the target sales tax numbers. And I think the answer is, even when those reporting periods come up, we won't. And I don't think we'll see.CVS and some others could bring that to.Us in order to get access to the Franchise Tax Board data, we have to treat it as confidential information. It is not even resident on our computers, so that's why we hire HTL. They we give them permission to get our data.We do not have nor can we release any information about specific taxpayers. That's what we have to agree to in order to get the detailed information. We can tell you in general, big categories like service sectors, or we can tell you by geographic areas.But and if we have something that's Alameda landing, you know, all the stores that are there, you have to make some assumptions.Know that was the question. Are we going to be able to identify Alameda landing in the future?Yes, we we have already asked for that, right?Yes, you have. Thank you.And I appreciate the report. Thank. Thank you. So in regards to sales tax, I know there are many elements that do shop on our historical districts and our historical districts and sales taxes, sales tax. So you can also continue to shop and Park Street, Webster Street.Of course, we have South Shore. And for me, in regards to whether we have another gas station, we have gas stations on Webster already. We do have other gas stations. And I will encourage people to shop all of our districts to our historical districts.And so personally, I am concerned about the building of more retail. Retail provides low paying jobs. And as we saw earlier today, many people are concerned about low paying jobs. That would be nice to have and to attract and some there were quite a few people that referred to car sales and maybe that's not going to becoming back. However, I think entertainment quite often is more of a win win in regards to our meetings are very supportive of, from what I have seen, entertainment, restaurants, things like that that are of other ways of bringing in sales tax revenue.So thank you very much. Yes, sir. We'll have a motion.Please move that we accept the quarterly sales tax report I second.Okay. All those in favor I oppose abstentions. Motion carries unanimously. All right, next item.\nSummary:", "answer": "Recommendation to Accept the Quarterly Sales Tax Report for the Period Ending September 30, 2014 Collected During the Period April 1, 2014 to June 30, 2014.  (Finance 2410) (Continued from January 20, 2015)"}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nMotion passes.Thank you. Item number 18, please.Communication from Vice Mayor Richardson, Councilmember Pierce, Councilwoman Mongo. Councilmember Your UNGA recommendation to receive and file a report on the status of inter-departmental efforts around the education, prevention and enforcement of.Illegal fireworks in Long Beach.Thank you. So we know every summer, increasingly our offices are bombarded with phone calls and the police department does a tremendous job in the time leading up to the 4th of July, in the months, months after, for the 4th of July, and dealing with the issue of illegal fireworks.And I wanted to make sure that we do have an opportunity out here in public session to hear from our our fire department about our efforts. I want to highlight one thing. And, you know, this is a really cool lawn sign that's going up in front of my house.I know that it's really sensitive for people who have pets. I know it's sensitive to people who have newborns like myself. I have a pet and a newborn, but it's also a very serious issue to people who value quality of life and, you know, veterans with PTSD and folks who are who are actually harmed by these activities. So I want to hear from our city staff on some of those efforts. And I just have a few questions after that. So let's go ahead and turn it over. Steph, thanks. Chief Mike Duffy Mr. Vice Mayor. Council Members.Good evening. And I'm joined here at the podium with my partner and public safety and city chief Robert Luna. And as was just mentioned, the 4th of July holiday is just under a month away. And as usual, the holiday will be commemorated with block parties, legal and organized fireworks shows and unfortunately, illegal fireworks.As I've reported in the past, the NFPA reports an annual average of about 18,500 fires caused by fireworks from 2009 to 2013. And in 2014, the U.S. hospital emergency rooms treated over 10,500 people for fireworks related injuries. 51% of those injuries were to extremities and 38% were to the head.The risk of fireworks injury is highest for young people ages 5 to 9, followed by children aged 10 to 19. Your police and fire departments have been working together for several months to address fireworks, education and enforcement in a proactive manner and to encourage the Long Beach community to have a safe 4th of July holiday.The staff report will provide a brief summary of these activities. Our primary focus is public outreach and education to communicate that message that all fireworks, even those labeled safe and sane, are dangerous and illegal in the city of Long Beach.As in previous years, the fire department will continue to coordinate public service announcements and press releases, distribute educational materials in English, Spanish, Carmi and Tagalog to communicate our message throughout the city. We are using a variety of media to accomplish this, including social media sites, electronic signage and posting fliers in highly visible locations such as parks, librariesand city busses. An example of what's in city busses is right here, and I'll be able to share that with with you after excuse me. We're also utilizing our CERT program, volunteers and lifeguards, to distribute educational fliers to residents.And additionally, fireworks are illegal. Magnets are now displayed on all fire department apparatus throughout the city. Representatives from the fire department will speak at block parties and other community events about the illegality and dangers of all fireworks. And requests for block party permits will continue to be coordinated through the Special Events Office, but the block party organizerthis year must sign a permit stating that they're aware of all regulations, one of which is an acknowledgment that all fireworks are illegal. Our other focus is on enforcement. As you can imagine, our communication center receives hundreds of fireworks related calls on the 4th of July.In the days immediately preceding and following. In many cases, the caller is not able to identify a specific address, making it difficult to locate and report a reported incident. It is also common for a suspect to flee the scene prior to the arrival of fire or police staff.Last year, our enhanced police and fire patrols handled over 80 fireworks related incidents, issued citations and multiple warnings, and seized over £600 of illegal fireworks. Additionally, the fire department responded to five fires and one serious medical emergency, an injury that were all directly related to fireworks.It is important to remember that this increased call load for both fire and police over this holiday period is in addition to what we would normally expect to see in our normal call volumes. This time of year is already typically busy for us in the 4th of July holiday period just compounds that every year we ensure thatwe have all available personnel on duty to handle what we know will be a very busy period for public safety in Long Beach this year. To respond to reports of illegal fireworks on the nights of July 1st to July 5th, the fire department will deploy two additional patrol vehicles, each staffed with two arson investigators to work inconjunction with our police department's proactive patrols. Patrols will continue to target those areas of the city known for historic use of fireworks and respond to reports of illegal fireworks activity citywide. Anyone cited or arrested for fireworks violations may face a fine of up to $1,000 and be sentenced to jail for up to six months or both.The fines and penalties may increase depending on the fireworks classification. Fireworks may be voluntarily disposed of at collection bins, which are located at all fire and police stations as well as lifeguard headquarters. The above. Measures are these measures are being implemented to encourage community to have a safe 4th of July holiday.And for those who want to view a fireworks show, I would mention that there are two professional firework shows already scheduled one on July 3rd in Alamitos Bay and one on July 4th at the Queen Mary. Mr. Vice Mayor.Mr. Mayor and Council Members, this concludes my report. Chief Luna and I are available to answer any questions you may have. Mr. Chief Looney, you have something that I thank you. Thank you. So. So you see our you know, we are working together, our fire department, our police department, they work hard every year.And we know that if you want to see fireworks, you can go to Alamitos Bay or you can go to the Queen Mary. But we all know those of us who live in our neighborhoods understand that this is going to require a little bit more.We're going to need to work with our neighborhood associations and our neighborhood leaders to make sure that we are doing our part to sort of hold each other accountable. I think we need to send a clear message. I think these these lawn signs will help to send a very clear message.And so I want to I want to, you know, first just ask the chief, how would you envision we could sort of work with our neighborhood groups to disseminate these signs and the other materials that we have? Like, you know, I have this one that's printed in Spanish and we have all you know, we have, you know, English, Spanish, combined, Tagalog, all of all over four languages. What outreach efforts are we doing to make sure that our neighborhood associations and our neighborhood leaders have access these heading into the 4th of July weekend? Mr. Vice Mayor, as of today, I'll give you a rundown of all the activities that we've been doing through our fire preventionand community. And how about, you know, we don't even need all of them. I just think very specifically, if you're a neighborhood association working to get this stuff right, we can get those. You can reach out to Long Beach fire headquarters.We can provide you access to those things. We will be making the rounds out to all the neighborhood associations, community groups, faith based organizations. Also be able to plug people in through our social media sites, our city website next door.A lot of the other social media sites that are active in our communities, we're targeting those as well to get the word out to people and we will be able to provide these these materials to them. Great. And I want to make sure I know funds are limited.So we want to allocate some resources to make sure we have, you know, enough of these lawn signs at our field office and at Fire Station 12, so we can partner to make sure those are available there, right?Yes, sir. Absolutely. And then in terms of we you know, we get a lot of chatter on social media that people don't know how to collect the right information to report, say an adult who's contributing to the delinquency of a minor and engaging here.So I know that the police department does go around to every single one of our neighborhood association meetings every month. So is it possible, Chief Luna, to make sure that over the course of this next month we're equipped with specific message on here's the information that's helpful to actually make sure we can, you know, we can levya fine or a ticket to someone who's engaging in fireworks. Can we make sure we have a message like that or a training available? Vice Mayor Richardson and members of the City Council, thank you for asking that question.Yes, we have been doing that and will continue to do that and step it up. Honestly, I wish we can get through the 4th of July with issuing zero citations, but I don't believe that's a reality, unfortunately. We are going to stress or encourage community members to make sure that when they do see somebody lighting fireworks thatthey call our communications center and any time the officers are going out there, we are encouraging the officers when they do see the illegal activity occurring to make sure they do.Issue the citations.And if the parents are involved, there will be consequences for them as well. But I can't tell you how important it is for people when they see this activity to report it. I think somebody will be less likely to do it if they know everybody's watching them and will call the police when they're doing so.Fantastic. So that concludes my my questions. And I just want to say, you know, we're we're one team here as a city. I see the chatter on social media on next door. I get it. I live in the neighborhoods.I understand the only way we can abate this is we really hold our neighbors accountable. So I have this lawn sign up. We'll have them available to our field office. We'll have them available at Fire Station 12. And feel free to continue engaging our police department and engaging your neighbors.Thank you so much and happy 4th of July.Thank you, Councilmember Pearce.Yes. I want to thank Vice Mayor Rex Richardson for bringing this item forward. And I think you asked a lot of the same questions that I was going to ask. I did want to. Find out. Just so I know, every year around 4th of July, everybody says there's not enough officers out.Chief Luna, how many officers do we have out on 4th of July?Lots of them.I understand. It's all of them. I know what I've been told.Yeah, what we do. The 4th of July is the busiest day of the year for the Long Beach Police Department, as well as my partner here from the for the fire department as well. Unless you have a scheduled vacation or there's some unusual circumstances, you are working one of the shifts on the 4th of July.So our staffing is significantly increased for that day. And I'm happy to report, although we're sitting here talking about a very annoying issue with fireworks, that really the men and women that work for the city entire, whether it's public works, the fire department or police department, if you take the last several 4th of July and how manypeople are in the city celebrating. Yes. And drinking, too. And some other things. We keep this city, at least we have in the past, thank God, very safe with the influx of people we have here. So we've done an amazing job.And I think it's because of our planning. Our strategies have been very effective in dealing with with the fourth.Great. Thank you so much. Again, I just want to commend the work and I know I'll have a sign in my front yard and hopefully my neighborhood associations will also be able to get many signs as well. Thank you, guys.Thank you, Councilman Andrews.Yes, I like to I just one question I can ask both. First of all, I want to commend our police chief and Chief DeVries for this. But because the question I'd like to ask is that can we put these signs up in our parks and recreation areas?Can these signs go up there?Councilmember? Absolutely. We're happy to provide the access to these materials and where you place them. I would leave that up to up to you, certainly. And I would encourage I would encourage, you know, any council member who is interested in getting these signs.We can definitely point you in the right direction. Thank you. Where you place them is up to you.Thank you.Thank you. Is there a public comment on this item? Please come forward. Sir. Mr. Goodhew.Very good. I would suggest we do two things. One. Anybody caught doing fireworks? The fine is 1500 dollars. Period. That's an emergency order. Number two, the individual. Will. Spend. 50 hours per month in the animal shelter. And in addition to that.We will pay any off any police officer or fire department member or any other security people. The city wants $1,000 if they find somebody and have for that, find somebody shooting out fireworks. Half of that will go to that officer, be it a policeman, fireman, somebody they hire, a city staff person, whoever.And we all benefit financially by that because quite frankly, posting those signs is useless, period. Half of them after kids will take those and use those. Like they're like the firecrackers from the fire that they set those that they use those to build.So let's get pragmatic about it. Thank you.Thank you. Seeing no other public comment members, please go ahead and cast your votes.\nSummary:", "answer": "Recommendation to receive and file a report from City Manager on the status of interdepartmental efforts around the education, prevention and enforcement of illegal fireworks in Long Beach, as well as an update on statistics from last year's efforts; and \r\n\r\nRecommendation to request City Manager and Long Beach Fire Department to partner with neighborhood associations and community groups to disseminate educational materials in advance of July 4th."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nOkay. Thank you. Motion carries. And we'll go on to the next item. Madam Clerk. I think we'll do 24.Communication from Councilwoman Mongo, Councilwoman Gonzales, Councilmember Supernanny recommendation to refer to the Parks and Recreation Commission. The review of and request the City Manager to direct the Department of Parks, Recreation and Marine to prepare a report within 90 days on current and long term deferred park maintenance issues.Thank you. Item 24, please. Councilman Mangled.So we got to touch on this a bit earlier in the item related to cleaning up Long Beach. I think that we have worked as hard as we can with as many nonprofit and community groups. And quite honestly, there are some recovery groups that we've worked strongly with in the community to do our best in cleaning upparks. We've done Volunteer Day and a lot of those things, but we need some structure to what is being done right now. It's a lot of one off opportunities and there isn't a uniformity. We've grown as a city so quickly and even Councilwoman Pearce was mentioning we're bringing on board another dog park.And the challenge for these things is that the community wants them. And so we want to be supportive. But a lot of times these comes from from funds that are only available for starting things and not maintaining them.And so it's really important that we have a maintenance strategy. And so I appreciate that many of us on the council have worked together to come up with a item that is robust enough to bring back some recommendations on how we can do that and make sure that it's funded.And so it is a tight turnaround, but we need to put our money where our mouth is and really stand up for the youth of our community and the cleanliness of our parks.Thank you. Councilman Gonzalez.Yes. I, too, want to thank Councilmember Mongo for bringing this forward. I know. Ah, you know, we've just talked about litter. Now we're talking about cleanliness at our parks. And to be able to take a deeper dove into what this will mean for our city is fantastic.So I thank you for bringing it forward. And I know I believe there was a report and I'm just trying to pull that out. My apologies. It was the or a newsletter. I'm sorry. It was the it was there was a section basically highlighted the number of hours worked in certain areas of the city regarding litter pickup at our parks. But I think it just related to just one park. And so I'd like to see if there's a way we can get that information for all of our parks. I know that's a big feat, but if there's more information we can receive in terms of number of hours worked in certain areas related tolitter pick up and maintenance, I think a lot of our residents would like to know about that. And so I look forward to working through this with our Parks Department as well as working with the other council members here on the dais.I know we can also get creative in terms of volunteerism. Perhaps there's a program we can create for parks in that respect too. So thank you very much.Thank you. We have Councilwoman Pryce.I support this item and I want to thank Councilwoman Mongo and my other colleagues for bringing it forward, and I look forward to seeing the report back. I completely agree with Councilwoman Mungo regarding the dilemma that we are in, in regards to responding to constituent concerns with the limited resources that we have.So I look I look forward to more creative opportunities being brought forward, and I look forward to us getting to a point where even though things may seem not feasible or viable at the outset, we're looking and seeking every opportunity to make them a reality for us in a way that works.So thank you very much for this item.Thank you, Councilmember Pearce.Yes. I also want to thank my colleagues for bringing this item forward. Bixby Park, obviously one of our very active parks that has had a lot of challenges with restrooms, cleanliness, tree trimming as well. And we've also had I've had a lot of conversations with different entities that are coming to our city, whether through conferences or doingour World Series here. And so I think it's also a good time for us to bring back the conversation around corporate sponsorship. And if there are some opportunities like we had, you know, I had a meeting today with the Spaulding, right?That makes the basketballs. Is there an opportunity to try to get them to participate in funding some of the opportunities outside of just youth programs, which they love doing, but also adopting different parts of our park so that we can have a plan, whether it's three years or five years, what limitations there might be, too, that.We can put a basketball hoop in the in the pool and they can fund that bet.That's a great joke. Let's do it.I'm going to go back to Councilman Mongo.So to address the sponsorship opportunities. I want to thank my colleagues that worked with me on the item that is now published on the Parks and Rec website. So if Spalding wants to sponsor a park or any other thing in the city, they have a method to do that through a one page application process.So you can work with the outside entity to craft what you think might be a good fit for the city. And then we can pull that all together through a one page transparent process. And they're working through the next phase of like showing the community anything that's been applied for and what's been approved and where it isin that process or why it's not a good fit at this time, but could be in the future. So I would encourage that and I look forward to more opportunities such as the ones that we have really nurtured like Spalding.Thank you.

Thank you. Members of the council, Andrew Webb here from Community Planning and Development to present on a text amendment number six to the Denver zoning code, which would establish a new temporary tiny home village use and associated use limitations and regulations.It would also make some small updates to large development review procedures in the zoning code, as well as a clarification to a cross-reference on parking reductions for affordable housing, which I'll detail further on in the presentation. And I'll invite the sponsor as well to jump in at any point during the presentation if she has anything else she'dlike to add. So first of all, I'll just briefly set the stage here with an overview essentially of what tiny homes are. These are communities of small, individual sleeping units, typically arranged on a site with common facilities in single in a separate structure, common use structure.Kitchens, bathrooms, that sort of thing there. They exist around the country. And they've gained popularity as as one of many tools in the toolkit for addressing homelessness. They are particularly of interest to vulnerable populations such as the LGBTQ community, veterans, people with pets, couples and others that have challenges accessing conventional shelter systems in cities.So we're doing this text amendment, proposing this text amendment because tiny home villages are not currently addressed at all. The Denver Zoning Code, the rising popularity is something that the larger group Living Project noted over the last year and a half.And we do have, as I'm sure most all of you are aware, a community, tiny home community here, beloved community village. That village has operated on unlisted, temporary use permits. This text amendment would take some of the lessons we've learned during that pilot project and codify them into clearer regulations and use limitations for future applicants and createtransparency and predictability. This slide shows the actual proposed use definition for this temporary use. Again, we're talking about multiple relocate of all structures on foundations just sleeping in. It's not full dwelling units located on a single zone lot with common facilities.The zoning use permit for temporary tiny home villages would be aligned with whatever building permits were issued. Building permits will vary in length based on the permanency of utilities and facilities. So, you know, chemical toilets and temporary utilities are permitted.But in those cases, building permits and zoning permits would be shorter. The maximum permit duration is up to four years. And then upon expiration of those zoning permits, no new temporary tiny home village could be permitted on a exist on a subject site for at least four years.The slide highlights how this particular use is different from a kind of a permanent, temporary or a permanent tiny home village concept that we're working on as part of the Group Living Project. The intent here is to grant some flexibility from the zoning codes, building form and site design standards, especially as they address the public realm, thepedestrian realm. For operators that are seeking to address this very important need in the city to address homelessness. We are working on the group Living Project on a permanent version of this that would require at least one common structure to be built up at the at the primary street and meet the city's typical build to transparency andactive use requirements so that it would so that a permanent use would fit in better with the fabric of the community. This slide shows the zone districts that would be where this temporary use would be permitted. It's essentially all zone districts in the city except for open space districts in the lower intensity residential zone districts.So the single unit to unit and row home districts, that would be permitted only on properties where there is an existing civic or public use like a church or community center. And there would also be a limit of 30 sleeping units in a tiny home village in those lower intensity residential zoned districts.For all implementations of this use of community information meeting is required and I'll detail that in a subsequent slide here. This slide shows the requirement of applicants. They include an operational plan that details how the how the facility, how the village will be operated, a required community input information meeting prior to a zoning permit application and asite plan that demonstrates compliance with the siting and design standards of this temporary use, which I'll detail here shortly. The community information meeting is a is a new process that we developed with other stakeholders for this use and also for the large development review use.It is a pre application requirement where the applicants would go to the community and gives an opportunity for them to begin building a relationship with the community. There are expanded notice requirements from some of our typical zoning code requirements for this community information meeting that are new as part of this amendment.They include the typical mailed notice to affected city council members and property owners. We're also expanding the requirement from the typical 200 foot buffer to 400 feet. So R.A. is within 400 feet. Other community organizations that are not registered are knows within 400 feet.And not only owners of properties, but also tenants of of of rental properties, both residential and commercial. So as a part of this, CPD has worked with a vendor to, to create a new database of about 135,000 apartment unit address data.So it's essentially all the apartment units in the city so that postcards can be sent to those units as well as commercial units where, where businesses might rent space to allow for us to to implement that new requirement.The operational plan requirements are listed on the slide. I won't go through every single one of them, but generally speaking, we're will be asking upfront for details on how residents will be selected for a tiny home village, how the facility will be maintenance, how housekeeping facilities will be provided, things like laundry and health care, that sort ofthing. We'll ask for details on community governance procedures and how how community will deal with members that have violated those requirements. Single point of contact for emergency and mitigation of external effects, among other requirements. The slide shows the the zoning requirements that would be established for temporary tiny home villages by this text amendment.So the primary street or front setback in lower intensity residential zoned districts would be 20 feet, which is generally aligned with typical requirements in residential districts, and it would be per per the zone district minimums elsewhere, side and rear setbacks requirements would be five feet.Entry features would be required on common use structures if they're located within 25 feet of a primary street. An entry feature is essentially a door that is accessible to pedestrians and is an obvious point of entry to the site.We're not requiring off street parking, minimum off street parking for this use. We've heard from operators that there's generally not really a demand for vehicle parking for this use. The number of units permitted on a site would, as I mentioned, in the lower intensity zone districts would be capped at 30 sleeping units on on all other sites. It would be determined by lot size and and required building separation requirements. Those are. Part of the of a recent building code amendment that the council adopted in July, also setting up some building code requirements for tiny home villages.The building separation requirement is ten feet, though there are allowances for smaller separation distances if buildings are built to meet certain fire suppression standards. And I'll also highlight here that accessory uses like pets and gardens would be allowed as they are and regulated as they are for typical residential uses.The slide just highlights some of the additional accountability mechanisms for temporary tiny home villages above and beyond a typical residential use in the city and county. So I mentioned the operational plan and its set of requirements. If there is public funding being used to assist or pay for a tiny home community, there would be contract requirements forthat funding. While we're not requiring good neighbor agreements, the community information meeting is the opportunity for an applicant to have that conversation with neighbors and potentially enter into that. Adding another layer of accountability between the operator and the community.And then the the Pre-Application outreach, the community information meeting provides an opportunity beyond a typical residential uses to to make the community aware of what's happening and answer get their questions answered. This slide shows some some possible development scenarios based on different lot sizes, accounting for building separation and typical structure sizes on a on a do soon a typical, very small lot of 4000 square foot lot inclusive of common structures. You could fit about five sleeping units and that goes up exponentially as you get larger on a 12,000 square foot lot, you could get about 24 units.This slide highlights some of the changes to other sections of the code that would be made by this text amendment. The first is too large development review. As I as I mentioned, that process was adopted into the code on in July and did include the community information meeting requirement.However, at that time, that meeting requirement was included in the section of the code that actually deals specifically with a large development review. This amendment would move the community information meeting requirement out of the older section and into a standalone section in the code where it can be cross-referenced by upon this text amendment.Elders in temporary tiny home villages but potentially future uses as well. It also adds the expanded notification buffers and the renter and business occupant notification requirements to the LDR process. Additionally, this amendment makes a small change to a parking reduction section of the code to clarify a cross-reference that allows for reduction of parking to for affordable housingprojects that meet the requirements of the inclusionary housing ordinance, which has since been repealed and replaced. This amendment updates those references to the city's current affordable housing standards so that current new developers of affordable housing can take advantage of this parking reduction.This line details the process for for this project. This has been going on for for quite some time. We really started talking about the whole universe of group living and kind of these unique and emerging uses in March 2018 as part of the group living process or project.And we've had many public meetings about this type of use and many other related uses. In spring of this year, it was we decided to pull this project at the request of the sponsor out of that larger project and send it through on its own.And we had several meetings at that time with inter neighborhood cooperation and a public meeting to present on the proposal and take some community input. We put a summary and red line draft of the text amendment out in late June for review planning board hearing took place on August 7th and received a unanimous recommendation of approval.The Land Use Transportation and Infrastructure Committee considered this on August 27th and did send it to the council. And that brings us to where we are today at the council public hearing. This slide just highlights a few of the changes that we did make based on some of the public input that we did receive.They include the limits of of the tiny home village use on sites in low intensity residential districts to those sites that already have some sort of civic or public use and limiting them to 30 sleeping units in those lower intensity districts as well, allowing the or requiring that for years past between establishment of a new tiny homevillage on a subject site after one vacates the site and then notice the new notice to renters and non R.A. community entities that serve an area. We have received quite a few letters about the project and providing feedback.Those have all been included in your in detail, in full detail in the staff report. These are the criteria for adopting a text amendment to the zoning code. This text amendment is impacted by three adopted plans the Comprehensive Plan Blueprint Denver and Housing and Inclusive Denver.This amendment is consistent with the goals and strategies from two of the two key comprehensive plan elements. It would advance several of the equitable, enforceable and inclusive element goals enabling by enabling a range of a range of housing types, promoting flexible options to and and promoting flexible options to meet the needs of people transitioning out of homelessness. It would also advance the strong and authentic neighborhood element by introducing the new renter outreach requirement and expanding outreach requirements in general. In general, such as expanding the the boundary in which we have to actually send notification to two community members and residents.The Sixth Amendment is consistent with many blueprint goals and strategies aimed at responding to the city's unique housing needs. It would enable a new housing option, essentially to be part of the toolkit for addressing homelessness. And this text amendment was developed through a robust public process as detailed previously.Implement several of all three of Blueprint's three equity concepts by expanding options for low cost housing that can help stabilize people's lives and improve access to jobs and services. And by permitting the use citywide, it helps contribute to the diversity of housing types citywide.And finally, this text amendment implements policies and recommendations from the housing an inclusive Denver that's the city's housing plan by adding a flexible new housing use that can help address homelessness and by establishing new outreach and public engagement opportunities.With regard to the second criterion. This text amendment would further public health, safety and welfare by implementing adopted policies for enabling affordable housing and options for people experiencing homelessness, and by creating more predictable, transparent city processes. And it would address the third criterion by resulting in uniform processes and regulations for temporary tiny home villages that are uniformwithin each zone district in which this temporary use is allowed. So with that, staff recommends the council adopt this text text amendment based on a finding that all review criteria have been met. And I'm happy to stand for any questions.Thank you very much. We do have 16 individuals signed up to speak on this issue this evening. So I'm going to call five at a time up when I call you up, if you could come up to this front row so that you're ready to jump up to the microphone when I call your name.Charles Allison Godfrey and Elizabeth James. Ron see Paul Bendell and John Hazen, if you could come up. And Charles Allison Godfrey, you are a first.Thank you, counselors. My name is Charles Allison Godfrey. I live at the cross streets of 30th and Zuni, and I'm here on behalf of myself, the University of Denver Law School's Land Use Law Society and the National Lawyers Guild.I have gathered about 50 signatures here from the law students that support the tiny home village zoning amendment. For years, the homelessness crisis in our city has existed at unacceptable levels. Metro Denver Homeless Initiatives Point in Time survey documented a 14% increase in the total homelessness population from 2018 to 2019.The crisis will continue to grow as homeownership has become increasingly unattainable for the majority of our city's residents, as rental rates skyrocket and as funding for housing assistance decreases. With the tiny home village zoning amendments. Denver has an opportunity to make a low cost investment.Will having an immense impact on the lives of individuals experiencing homelessness. As the beloved community village has shown time and time again. These village can villages can exist side by side with welcoming neighborhoods. The villages help foster an environment where formerly homeless individuals can have a space of their own, something many have lacked for years.The villages also allow time for people to develop skills that will help them stay housed in the future. We urge you to vote yes to expand housing opportunities for homeless individuals in our city. Thank you.Thank you. Next up, an Elizabeth.I'm an Elizabeth. Located at these 50th and Washington very near East 50th and Washington in Globeville. And I want to thank the council for having this public hearing. I'm here not to speak for or against the amendment, but to ask that the process be a deeply well-considered process, given the residual of the pain that continues to lingerin Globeville because of the manner that this came to Globeville, out of which came many of the lessons that are now being brought into this piece of, I guess it's legislation. One of the things I'd like to ask is that all all city council members really recognize that this is a citywide problem that can be resolved bycreating an inventory and it can be a matter of talking, looking quickly, going to find where the many diverse needs of homelessness solutions can be found. But I do feel like this process has not generated the deep learning that I think needs to happen for operators of these facilities, the tiny home projects, to be vetted for theirtheir cultural sensitivities and ability to create the bridges between the residents of tiny homes and the residents in the neighborhoods. Globeville. I'm here as an individual, by the way, not affiliated with any of the Arnaud's I've worked with, not on behalf of anyone else, and quite aware of many people in Globeville that are not here, that arewishing that that there there could be more constructive empathy. The situation, the process was mishandled both by the city council person at the time and the staff that came in from the DCC. I don't have any questions about where people's hearts are at.I wish that this was the type of process that could be audited.Through the city auditor sociologically.I think there's a great deal to discuss. I would like it to be looked at deeply without it being politicized. I think Globeville has all of the elements in concentration that have to be considered in every neighborhood when bringing in the mixture of populations that have a variety of combined stresses and and and aspirations and hope.A lot of what the stress was in Globeville was because the clover was the first neighborhood where the neighborhood planning was rolled out, deploying the planners. And there was there was a blow in relationship to that, too, and with the love for the tiny home residents, which should be respected.I would just ask the City Council to rise up to a deeper evaluation of what this process has been. Do a debriefing, look for best practices, use the standards that are used when National Science Foundation grants come in with programs come in.We need to look more deeply at this because.Just listening I'm sorry.Was your time is up. Thank you very much for full. Next up, James Ramsey. Thank you. My name is James Ramsay. I'm a resident of Denver. I own my own home in the Capitol Hill neighborhood.I'll just be brief.This thank you for considering this amendment to the zoning code. It offers a regulatory environment that allows individuals and members of the community to provide the sort of attainable housing that is not otherwise provided through higher costs and private development.I, for one, as a homeowner, would welcome a tiny home village on my block and in my neighborhood without question. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you. Next up, Paul Mindel.Hi. Thank you for having me. I'm here to speak in favor of the support of tiny home village tax amendment. I'm grateful for all the work that the Community Planning and Development Agency has done, and I've been a part of that group Living Advisory Committee the whole way.Um, so I'm also speaking on behalf of Quinn City Cooperative in Capitol Hill. I believe these forms of housing strengthens Denver's community by providing an opportunity for shared governance and micro solidarity. So micro solidarity is the act of small groups of people banding together and supporting each other economically and emotionally.It's not a particularly new kind of thing. People have done that since Indigenous resistance to colonization all the way through the Underground Railroad to today. You know, small groups of people trying to survive. So in this context, though, I think it's very necessary in the face of Denver's real estate, runaway real estate values and also just theneoliberal policies that we've inherited. And so I believe it's amazing that tiny home villages can allow sort of small groups of people to come together. And in the case of a beloved community village, support each other to create jobs and access to permanent housing.I also see it providing shared governance, which is also an important thing. I worked in a homeless shelter in Flagstaff, Arizona, and saw firsthand that, like moving dozens and hundreds of people in and out of a building each night created high pressure, and it also reduced the amount of autonomy and dignity that individuals received.And so I believe that, you know, these communities, which do allow an aspect of shared governance, of people having a say in a in the circumstances and decisions that affect their lives. I think shared governance is just a huge asset to Denver's community and to building out greater resources to those who are, I guess, most excluded byour current economy.Could you state your name for the record? Paul Bender. Thank you. Next, John Haden.Hello. Members of council. My name is John Haden. I live in the Five Points neighborhood and I have a property at 34th and Lawrence, which is just a few blocks from where the first community village, beloved community village was located.And so I'm here to testify firsthand as a neighbor about how extraordinary that experience was to have the village in in our neighborhood and what a difference it made for the people in that village to have that sense of community versus what we've seen in the larger shelters on the other end of of our own neighborhoods.So we had kind of this view of of two very different ways of treating people who are experiencing homelessness. And the village, the tiny home villages really are something I would love to see our city embrace. And I'm here to actively support that because I believe they are beneficial to the people who who live in the village. And also and perhaps more importantly for you, because I believe they're beneficial to the neighborhoods where the villages are located. And this amendment does something very important, which is provide the opportunity for these villages to be located throughout the entire city.And I, I really believe that if we have these villages in, in neighborhoods across the city, even in high income neighborhoods, that it will help reduce the sense of the homeless are other from us. People need to understand that people who are experiencing homelessness are in fact their neighbors, that they are people just like them.And by reducing the segregation of our city, by providing housing types from people of all income levels, we do we're taking a step in the right direction to do that. I would like to recommend one thought for you.There is a piece of land outside the city county building that was recently considered for a park, for art, for a museum that's not coming. It's owned by RTD, and I think it would be a fantastic site for a tiny home village right in the center of downtown, where our city can speak loud and clear.These are our neighbors. This is something to be proud of. Thank you.Thank you. I'll call the next five if you could come up to the front. Duane Petersen, Tyrese Howard Cole. Chandler, Jesse Paris and Julie Patino. Duane Petersen. Europe.Hi.Updating the zoning code for the tiny home village would allow for the expansion of tiny.Homes to be built in other locations.Providing opportunities to more individuals experiencing homelessness to achieve housing. Having a secure place to reside is important to one's self-esteem. Tiny homes offer safety and stability while providing an individual.With independence and dignity. Thank you. My name is Dwayne Peterson.Thank you very much. Tyrese Howard.Hello. My name is Patrice Howard. I'm going to speak with two hats. Now, most of y'all know me as an organizer with Denver homeless out loud, but I'm also a part of the Village Collaborative as a board member and original founder of this village.And I want to speak a little bit to the history which brings us to this place. So back in 2015 and 2016, I and others were in this very council chambers asking you all council members for support for legalization of tiny home villages, which were not yet legal at that time.2017 that legalization came came about through a variety of supports, mostly from community planning and development and others.And and the beloved community village.Was able to open up.For the first temporary temporary site. That struggle of.Of three or four years to just legalize the villages themself did not end. In 2017.When the village became legal.The unlisted temporary use permit process that the original village was under. Well, it was a great initial pathway was filled with flaws and and struggles that made it extraordinarily difficult to find other sites to to to go through the zoning process in.A streamlined and efficient manner.And so passing this zoning is is a critical step forward to streamlining the process to enable more of these villages to go up throughout the city of Denver in an efficient way and in a way that can build that community connection that is being talked about, and most importantly, in a way that faces the reality that housingis a basic human need and that right now we have thousands and thousands of folks who are homeless, sleeping on our streets, our alleys, our parks, our abandoned buildings, our busses, our shelters, and will continue to be. So this is a pathway just to make this a little easier to have a place to call home.So I am grateful for the support of Councilwoman Kennish in bringing this forward and in all her work that has made this a law that we can now vote on or that you can now vote on. And I don't have a vote, and I ask you all to please support this and moving forward.Thank you.Thank you. Next up, Cole Chandler.Good evening, counsel. I'm Cole Chandler. I live at 3024 Elizabeth Street and Denver's District nine. And I'm a co-founder of the Carter Village Collaborative. I'm also here on paternity leave. I just welcomed a new baby into my life.So I've gotten to talk with lots of you about the specifics of this text amendment. And I'd like to talk a little bit higher level this evening. And I think many of you will be familiar with this history.But we know that throughout the history of many of America's great cities, that certain zoning ordinances have been used as tools to exclude certain groups of people from accessing certain parts of town. We've regulated a lot sizes, home sizes, built forms, etc., in order to in order to produce well formed cities that serve to increase and preservethe wealth of a few while others are excluded. This historical reality has been one of the primary points of tension since the beginning of our effort. The history that Teresa was just remembering from back in 2015, when people were standing here in these chambers asking for a dignified resident led, tiny home communities.As soon as we started that process, we immediately found ourselves immersed in the power and access that has land accessibility in the heart of our city. Utilizing city planning tools, we have segregated our neighborhoods and communities based upon race, class, religion, gender, sexuality and more for generations.And we are weaker for that. The work of creating an equitable city is to take an honest look at that reality and find places to use the tools at our disposal to change that reality and rewrite that history, thereby liberating the land and the people who live on the land.This is what we have the opportunity to do tonight. We have the chance to make it permissible to build more community based housing, to put more houses on his own lot, to move outside of our traditional build to requirements in order to make space for a group of people in our city that are currently being excluded.We have the chance to rewrite just a tiny bit of history as we make a powerful statement that we all belong in Denver, regardless of our wealth, our racial background, our educational attainment, or the depth of our various struggles.This bill takes steps to make land access a bit more possible for those that don't otherwise have that right. And for that reason, it makes our city a bit more just and equitable, and thereby it makes all of us a bit more free.If this bill passes, the Colorado Village Collaborative looks forward to utilizing the tool, this tool, as we work with Denver's historic neighborhoods to find attractive ways to integrate our brothers and sisters on the streets into these historic communities.Together, we can weave a strong, robust social fabric that will make Denver an equitable, resilient and beautiful city for future generations. So thank you for your support and vision as we move together to free the land and free ourselves so that we may enter into deeper relationship with one another.Thank you.Thank you. Next up, Jesse Pearce.Good evening. Jesse Pierce represented for Denver Home, a sellout Black Star action moment for self, defense and positive and commitment for social change as well as universal African people's organization. We are in favor of this rezoning. As my colleagues have already stated, this has been a long fight with the city to allow for these things to beeven possible. This fight has been going on since 2012, since the urban camping ban was passed and we are currently asking for a repeal of that ban. So somebody sponsor. But back to this, there's been a long fight and now the city is coming to grips with the reality that we have a homeless crisis, even though wehave 23,000 vacant apartments. Because it's a real estate deal that the city refuses to do and members of this council. But I'm permitted to just trust the council as a whole. So I'm just going to leave it at that.With that being said, City, don't sit up here and try to take the credit for these villages, nor for the repeal of a ban that has been inhumane in 2019. We're still dealing with these type of laws, these sundown.Okeydoke. Jim Crow laws in a supposedly progressive, liberal city. So I don't even know where my city is anymore. I'm a native, long term native, and I don't know where this is going, but this is not my home and I do not feel at home here.So this is a start of we can do better and so on. The public actually what that looks like. But this is just a start. There's much more that's needed besides this. This isn't even scratching the surface, especially when we have 23,000 vacant apartments.So, yes, I'm in favor of this rezoning. Please pass this. It's a step in the right direction, especially since we could do better and we had the money and the resources to spend to program the public into thinking that it's time to show improve.I just came from the Show Me State, so you got to show me where and you can tell me. And that being said, I'll be running again in 2023.You could stay on the topic of this hearing.And we ask that you vote in favor of this. Thank you. Thank you. I'm not done yet. Thank you. Clinician others for your.Please address the councils of all individual council members.This is pushing this to actually get us this far. And like I said, there's more need. So since we can do better, let's do better and show us exactly what that looks like. Hold Council.Thank you. Thank you. Next up, Julie Pitino.Good evening, honorable counsel. My name is Julia Patino. I serve as the director of Basic Human Needs. How's that for a job title for the Denver Foundation? I'm here tonight in support of the zoning code update relative to tiny homes.The Denver Foundation is a 95 year old community foundation which invest very heavily in this community. We support not only community based organizations and individuals through grantmaking, but also through partnerships. The Tiny Homes Village, the Interfaith Alliance, a number of organizations that have been involved in the involvement of tiny homes, villages.Are all organizations that we've supported over the last five years alone. We have invested over $5 million in housing and homelessness and meeting basic human needs for this community. This is another cornerstone to ensuring that we have housing stock that is otherwise not available in the barren landscape that we have before us, particularly for individuals experiencing homelessnessor other vulnerabilities. We have a two fold relationship with the Tiny Homes Village. Not only have we been a funder and funded, not forks or excuse me, shovels in the ground, but really villages who came to us looking for funding relative to navigation and services that villagers sought out to help find jobs to attend school to meethealth needs to address another an array of needs. We have various nonprofit partners like Bayside Enterprises who are involved with that. We also have a role in terms of partnership in advancing housing policy and addressing homelessness from a grassroots level.Recognizing that people experiencing homelessness are the experts when it comes to addressing homelessness, and that even our well-intentioned efforts are not served unless we are including their voice and leadership. Thank you.Thank you. And recall the next group up. Tanya Sully. Mark Foul. Loretta Koehler. Chairman Sekou Kate. Bridget and Jeff Baker.Hello. My name is Tanya Saleh. I am a co-director of the Colorado Village Collaborative. I want to thank you all for your continued involvement and support for the Tiny Homes Village and finding a solution to the housing crisis in Denver.I would just like to start by saying you got a background of the Tiny Homes Village, but really what we see it as is transformational housing. We really seek to transform the lives of every resident that comes through our gates and our doors and give them a house and a key and a place to feel safe anddignified and unified in a community that they're not an outsider. But we are all one in the same space. Our goals are to expand and allow more people to have this sense of dignity and feel this sense of community.And due to their unfortunate situations of, you know, impossible rent in Denver and all the other factors that contribute to the housing crisis allow people to have an opportunity outside of shelters, outside of the limited other options for housing, and to provide a unique solution, not the only solution, but it is one.So we want to pave the way for expansion and fill a gap in this continuum of housing and to have an opportunity to expand on our women's village that we've already put the groundwork for. But this will allow a more streamlined path for that to happen and for more villages to come.So the personal transformation that I've seen in the village, through the residents, through people who have even supported this, is this sense of community, through even the success of us being in a part of a community. So we've we've seen crime go down in a neighborhood.We've seen either a positive impact or no impact at all. And so allowing this to take place in different neighborhoods outside of District nine and other districts in other places across the state, this is going to be the first step.This is a model for the city. This is a model for other organizations that are looking to find solutions for housing and clearing. Things such as permitting will allow us to focus on what we really seek to do, which is provide transformation, to provide healing, to provide community, and to provide a sense of ownership in the House, in the places they live in and feel part of it moving forward. Having this stability is the main factors that see success. So having a long term, a longer term place on the site will allow more stability and that'll be more success within our villages.This will be an opportunity for other organizations to implement similar model models. The biggest piece is equitable community engagement. As you can see, we've had some we're still healing from past community engagements with not enough time. So this will allow us to approach it in a time where renters, homeowners, businesses, Arnaud's we can all get together andcollaborate to see what we want our city to look like. So thank you all and I hope you can support this.Thank you. Next up, Marc, Val.Thank you. My name's Mark Fall. I'm a resident of Douglas County, unincorporated. And I want to speak tonight on sort of the technical aspect of the tiny home village I've been involved in the in the process since 2017 and being familiar with the design of the tiny homes and also how the community, Denver Community Planning and DevelopmentDepartment has supported this. There's been great concern for the quality of construction and the quality of the built environment. So I think that expanding the length of time that these units are in place is a doable and reasonable thing.I don't think that it's a substandard building for that kind of stay, and I think that that's very, very important because to let someone stay someplace for an extended period of time at all, the environment has to be built safely.And I think that the CBD has shown great concern for that. They've required a builder with a Class A license to do the construction and oversee the construction of these tiny homes. And the designs have been done by, you know, registered architects, profession, very professional manner, all that's been done.The other aspect of this is that if the tiny homes can stay in one location for six months, you need a new location every six months. If they can stay in a location for four years, then that decreases the number of new locations you need to scale this effort up.And it's a very successful effort, but for a very small segment of the homeless community. So to make it a more effective solution for a larger group of homeless people, a longer stay is important to accomplish that. Lastly, I think there's a proactive measure where the city of Denver will not be reacting to problems that come forwardwith that that other cities have seen in other tiny home communities. So I applaud the city of Denver for looking at this in a very proactive manner, and it's a great opportunity to be out in front of this and prevent problems that might occur with these villages in the future.Thank you. Next up, Loretta Koehler.Hi. I'm Loretta Kaylor, and I live in Baker historic neighborhood. And and I'm part of the group Living Committee. And and I want to just talk about a little bit about me and why I think this is a really appropriate First Amendment.And I think we should you should go ahead and vote for this. I've worked most of my adult life with in in low income resource kind of areas. So I still do. And so I see the needs that aren't being met by a lot of different communities and I see where we're failing for our city.I would like to see I've worked a lot in in housing in the past and a lot with transit, transitional housing and a lot with domestic violence. And I think there's a lot of people who end up finding themselves homeless.We know because of medical needs, because of bills, because of domestic violence, for whatever other reasons. And I think this is a means for some people to have some other kinds of housing. When I worked for Boulder County Housing Authority, we worked on ways to work for housing for all kinds of individuals.And it was difficult because housing is so prohibitively expensive. And we know that Denver's become prohibitively expensive. We see this on a daily basis. When I see Homeless off of Broadway coming into our neighborhood and I see people everywhere.I am very supportive of this because there are benefits for somebody having a roof over their head. And we all know that. We all know that having somewhere safe to go to that you can call your own is very important.We know that those kind of supportive services that have been offered for those people in tiny home villages have been beneficial for those people. And the goal is that they can move on and have.Something more permanent.We need to have transitional housing across the city. As James said, I think the one thing that I would do is I would support it in my neighborhood if they are the industry said they wanted to have that down the street from me.I more than welcome.It because I think it's appropriate.I'd rather have people off the street. The other thing is I want my city to be forward thinking. I don't want is to be.Regressive and not look at what the needs are of people. I think we need to find.New ways to fit those needs.And this is one.Of those ways. Thank you.Thank you. Next up, Chairman Sekou.Okay. Contrary to popular belief, my name is not Notre Dame. I'm not Jimmy the Greek. But I'm telling you flat out, this is going pass. 100%. It's not because all of a sudden there's been a moral change here.You have seen the coming. You don't pass this, Jack. You're in trouble. And I'll tell you how I knew I was going to pass. I saw Herndon outside Lehman. I knew. I knew it. I knew it because if I was.Brooks had been sitting there when you came up. But there is a caveat here. I want to pay attention. It would go. There used to be a sitcom called The Little Rascals. And there was a young kid in there.That they call missed data. And she ended up being the advocate for the group, like the lawyer. But lawyers talk out of both sides of their neck because they always create the loophole for the pendulum swing because they always want to be getting paid on both sides.They don't get. So watch this here. The caveat and the loophole in this one is what? Temporary. Hmm. Not permanent. Temporary. That means it is subject to change when there is a regime change. Uh huh. Yeah. So there's no closer to that.But that's all right. In a morning, I'll be meeting with Michael to change this and give back to make it permanent. Permanent? If it's not permanent, it's not real. When that last zoning change came up, was it temporary that you could temporarily build another house inside your backyard?No. So now we've got two standards one for the privileged, one for the poor, and they're diametrically opposed to each other. So you can fool some of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all the people all the time.Age Data.Please refer to the counsels of all but individuals.As a whole. Little rascals. You need to grow up. You're too old for this. Acting like children.I'm sorry, but your time is up. Thank you very much. Next up is Cricket.Good job.I. My notes. My name is Kate Rigo. I am not in any formal role with CBC, but I have some background working with CBC informally, and I also have a number of friends who live our beloved community village.So I spent some time just hanging out there as sort of a part of the extended community connected to that village. I'm also an urban planning student at UCD, so I've done a little bit of study related to planning and zoning best practices around townhouse villages.I don't have anything comprehensive prepared for that, but I just wanted to speak about one thing I hadn't heard mentioned. Yeah, I mean, fortunately so far everyone has been pretty supportive, but I wanted to encourage members of council to not listen to any whatever naysayers might be out there who are going to say things like, well, youshouldn't, you know, shouldn't be bothering with Tanya's village stuff because it's not going to end homelessness. You can only house, you know, 14 to 30 people or whatever at a time. And there's however many thousands of people here who are experiencing homelessness and done it right now.So there's really no point. It's only a tiny drop in the bucket, so therefore you shouldn't do it. So I just wanted to I mean, hopefully no one is thinking along those lines here, but at least wanted to say it's I haven't heard anyone here say that we think this is going to just end.Homelessness across the board is just an important piece of lots of solutions and things that that we're all part of supporting across the board. So I want to put that out there cause folks to go ahead and pass this, recognize that it's not the be all and end all of something that's going to end that's going toend homelessness or anything. But then once that is passed, continue to look for further ways to be proactive and brave in addressing homelessness and more and more creative ways. I'd also wanted to and just real quickly echo lots of other things that folks have said about the importance of these of of this type of housing, the diversityof housing type that it adds to cities as well as positive impacts on communities around them. And most importantly, I think the kind of dignity that does just that is part of this form of housing that that brings to people who are living in it.And I think that it's all time for. Thank you.Thank you. Geoff Baker Hello Council.I'm representing Curtis Park Neighbors and president of Curtis Park Neighbors. And we are fully in support of this because it is a small step in the right direction. We would like to see this go to a more permanent down the road.So hopefully we'll be back again to talk about getting this into permanent. But this is a great step. One piece of the puzzle for solution towards homelessness. There's many other things that need to be done, of course, but hopefully with this moving in the right direction, we will see these popping up in neighborhoods and down the road. We won't even think anything of it.They'll just be part of the the housing stock that we have in Denver. So that's really all I got.We are in support of passing this. Thank you very.Much. Thank you. That concludes our speakers. Are there questions from members of council on this item? Councilwoman Ortega.Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to ask, first of all, CPD, if we have seen any other applications come through just knowing that this is pending legislation and possibly now includes, you know, other sites around the city.While we've heard some interest in coming forward with an application, we have not heard of any anything formalized yet. We have not received any specific applications. Okay.And would you mind coming up for a minute, please? Can you just share whether or not the tenants who live at the beloved tiny home village are expected to contribute financially towards their housing? And if not, what other kinds of contributions they're making?So the current residents of the beloved community village are not required to make financial contribution. They are required to participate in upholding the community agreements and participate in community life, including coming to meetings that occur weekly at the village and then also participating in upkeep and chores around the village.So those are their community requirements.All right. Thank you. Have no further questions.Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman CdeBaca.Thank you, Mr. President. Cole.Can you come back? Sorry.I almost jumped on there to ask you earlier. Quick question about the cost of setting one of these up and.What do you have options with the types of material you use?So when we first built this pilot project, we built 11 units for $145,000, which was an amazing thing. And it was done by 6000 hours of volunteer service and lots of just community involvement all around. We think that was awesome and we think as we try to scale, that's really difficult to replicate.So we've been working on a financial model, working with social impact solutions. And Ken, while on that and what we've found is that our startup capital costs for creating a tiny home village of 25 units, which is really the goal that we're trying to get towards, would be $600,000.And so that would include all the staff time, construction, time, design time, all that kind of stuff for $600,000 and a community building with water and sewer hook ups like what we're trying to currently do in Globeville. So that comes out to $30,000 per unit, but the material costs for the unit within that are 15,000.And so that's with what we're doing right now, a stick build that's gone through a traditional permitting process. You know, there could be possibilities for innovation with shipping containers and other kinds of things like that over time. But right now what we're looking at is that stick build $30,000 per unit kind of price point.And so when since these are temporary, when the time is up on one of them, you guys had a unique situation and I think you kept the materials from the original one.What happens to the materials when the time on this one is up and is there a commitment to keep the materials circulating?Yeah. So everything that we have on that site at 4400, Pearl would go to to a future site. The only loss, so to speak, would be whatever pipes we put in the ground and any improvements that we might make to the fence or those kinds of things.And so our move costs factor it out over four years. Time is something like $160,000. When you figure out the cost to move the buildings, the cost of that piping and infrastructure. So we build that into our operation costs for $40,000 a year over the four year time period.Awesome. And Andrew, can I ask you a couple of questions.About the material? Does this does this amendment.Say anything about what we can use, what we can't use for these villages?It does not. As long as the materials meet the the building code requirements, which are essentially the international building code and the international residential code requirements for a structure.Okay. Thank you.Thank you. Councilwoman Councilman Cashman.Yeah, thank you, Mr. President. Yeah. Following up a little bit on what Councilwoman CdeBaca said. Andrew Sorry. Not trying to take it easy on your knees. So this particular zoning would not allow things like are these? How about prefab mobile homes?It would not. This anticipates purpose built sleeping units that are not full dwelling units that don't have, you know, kitchens and bathrooms in them built for this specific use. This does not permit the use of RVs or mobile homes which are regulated separately in the zoning code.Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilman Cashman.Councilman Hines. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. CHANDLER. Yeah. I just want to follow up on something you said a minute ago. You said there's no financial contribution, is that right.From the residents themselves? That's correct, yes.Thanks for read my mind. So no one has to contribute like $17 a day. They don't have to contribute at all financially.Correct.Do you require residents to do some of your residents work? Yes. Do you require them to surrender their paychecks?We do not.Do you require the residents to get permission to leave the premises?No.I'm just thinking of reflecting back to another kind of marginalized community that we've had discussions about recently. And you're not a for profit corporation, is that right?That's correct.Who are your investors? Who who gives you money?So we're back to Colorado 501c3 We fundraise from individuals and from foundations like the Denver Foundation and the Colorado Health Foundation. And we would love to see a third leg of that investment strategy be the city investing in us as well.Thank you. And congratulations on your little one.Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Flynn.Mr. President, I. Andrew, a couple of questions. The. Are the civic, public and institutional uses in in the low density residential zones single unit, twin unit and row house. The use tables in the zoning code don't have a lot of them listed something.A lot of them are not permitted like a postal processing center and and a museum and things like that. What are what are examples of those types of uses that are permitted with limitation in those zones? Can you in.Those in those church density.Churches. What else?Community centers and schools.So what is it? I didn't see a good definition of community center in the zoning code. Could that be a private one? Like. Like a VFW hall or. Or does it have to be open to the public?That is a great question. I believe.I only ask great.Questions. I believe it would. I believe it would include something like a like a Fraternal Order Hall kind of thing. Like you like you mentioned not just a publicly operated.Okay. So the one and one problem that I see and I don't know if this is something that came up during the vetting and I'm just seeing it during the hearing as I'm listening. Is that in the zoning code, in the zone, in those residential zones, community centers, overnight accommodations are prohibited.Does this need to be addressed or is this something that this text amendment overrides intentionally?This would be a separate temporary accessory use to.The primary site. That's right. So the primary use does not allow overnight accommodations, but the accessory use can.That's correct.Okay. That's all I have. Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Flynn, seeing no other questions. The public hearing for Councilman 834 is closed. Comments by members of council counsel managers, the sponsor. Did you want to go first?Yes, I did. I'm sorry. I'm stuck on the wrong screen.Go ahead.Thank you so much to all of the speakers for coming out tonight. We have, if you think about an analogy for this project, is like the Olympic torch. It's really those who are experiencing homelessness who lit the torch and really said, this is what we want to try and this is what we need.And then that torch got passed at one point to city agencies with a directive that said, figure out how to do this. And one of the people who spent the most hours I'm really pleased is here tonight, which is Jill Jennings Golic, who is our former she was our deputy director of planning at the time.She was an acting director for a portion of this conversation. And she and many staff members took the torch and figured it out. It wasn't a sprint. It was like a worldwide marathon. Like you imagine the torch having to go around the whole globe maybe several times.And I think that that was hard. It was hard for me and other council members to watch how long it took. It was hard for the staff who once they thought they figured something out, found another piece. And I want to share that.One of the things that was hard about it was the tradeoff between safety and the same standards for folks experiencing homelessness and speed. And I personally had a few rounds on that with, you know, the building official particularly saying, you know, can't we sacrifice this for speed?Can't we sacrifice that for speed? And then the question of, well, you know, do we want to, you know, for example, sacrifice the safety risk of a floodplain for the speed of putting a village in. So this was not easy.And I want to thank all of the folks who took the torch next, which is many of you who are here from the group Living Zoning Code Group. So I may miss someone, but I got Loretta James, Paul, John, folks who spent a lot of hours and many folks who aren't here who took the torch to say, what are we mostly as residents who have not experienced homelessness? We had some work groups that had folks with lived experience on them. But what do we as groups feel like our obligation is and thinking about making our city more flexible.And so all I really get to do is carry the torch across the finish line like a foot and a half. Right. So I'm pretty humble. It's not my ordinance. I just I'm just here to help at the end, the staff.I also want to just thank Andrew and Tina Axelrod, who's not here for spending all of the hours they did as long along with Polly in my office. So I put up a visual because one of the things that folks ask me a lot in the community is what are we doing to address homelessness?And I've tried to find a one page thing that visually demonstrates the continuum. And what I say to folks is some of the things on this list we're working on making better. So emergency shelter is on the far left end of the spectrum and.We're trying to make it work better by moving it to the right so that it's more oriented towards housing navigation. And so that's something that's happening. A lot of what we do is we try to move our way to the right, we try to get out of the red and into the blue.And so one of the things that for me is really important when I when I came to the decision, I spent almost all of my time on the blue, right end of the spectrum, my time in office. That's what the housing fund was about.That's what doubling the housing fund and bringing forward $50 million for land, for supportive housing and those below 30% of median income was about and I was passionate and that's where I thought I needed to spend all of my time and talents, because that's the end of the spectrum.At that point, you're housed and you're safe and you're stable. It doesn't mean you don't need other supports, but it means you're no longer homeless. And for me, the moment where the realization occurred was when we had one project come forward for supportive housing in 2018, only one, and they did not get state tax credits.The city had all of our money sitting there and waiting to fill the gap, but our money's little and the tax credit money is big. And when the tax credit money fell through, we didn't have a new project in all of 2018.And that for me was the line that we had this big gap right in the middle where tiny home villages sits, right? We're trying to make all the things, all the shelter better and move people along. And we have the solution that we know works.And I just have to say it every chance I get. 300 folks chronically homeless, some for decades were offered housing for supportive housing, and only one person turned it down. People don't turn down supportive housing. It's just not common.And so what we know is folks want to be in this housing, but I can't build it fast enough. I couldn't make up all by myself for that 2018 project that went away. This proposal for me was about understanding that there was this gap right in the middle and that we had to put more energy into it. And I appreciate the willingness of the community planning and development to take this piece out and move it faster. Because even if we don't have an application pending, we do have sites. There is fundraising already done for a whole new village and they are looking for sites.And so we would have been six months behind the game if we had waited to do this ordinance. But we're doing it tonight to move faster and to have more creative options. So what I often say to folks is the things on the blue end of the spectrum, especially even in the middle, they work.The challenge is getting them to scale. And that's what this ordinance is about. This ordinance is about saying we need a whole bunch of land to choose from because it's really hard to get. And I want to just address one question about why temporary.I agree that we should have permanent tiny home villages, too. But in order to build a building attached to the ground and hook it up to plumbing and hook it up to electricity, you need to own the land.If you're going to build it forever, it has to be your land. And that is hard to find and it's expensive to find. So the most important thing was to get any land quickly. So this was one of those speed things.It was about saying if there's a piece of land that's needed for a rec center in three years, let's use it. Now. If there's a piece of land that's needed for a grocery store in five years, let's use it now.If there's a condo project, that'll come someday, let's use the land now. So temporary land is not saying that folks don't deserve permanent homes. Everybody, I hope, will move out of that tiny home village and to the supportive housing that comes next and to the permanent affordable housing that may not have any of her services because theydon't need them anymore. But the land itself is hard to come by. So while I'm working to get people into permanent homes, this is about creating spaces for villages as quickly as we can so we can get to scale.It's about the most people we can serve. And then I just want to close by saying that this is about more than just this ordinance doing the work. The ordinance is really the easiest part. As long as it took to get that torch around the globe three or four times, it is easy compared to finding that land. So we need to call upon our civic institutions, our landowners, those folks sitting on something and ask them to step up. Our city has stepped up. We're going to keep doing that, but we don't have a lot of we don't keep a lot of unused land around, but we all need to think about that.Secondly, most of you know, I've proposed and the council has graciously agreed to put forward a request that our budget include support services. Folks can't move from tiny homes to the next step on this scale without housing navigators, who can help them make the applications and do the work to get that permanent step next.And so I hope that we're able to get support for that change in the budget, and we need to do more than that. Right. So we heard the $600,000 cost. The best practice research was presented last year at the Housing and Homelessness Workgroup, and we know that cities are often contributing to operations, sometimes to capital, not always. But we can be thinking about other financial investments. We can only grow the scale if the resources are aligned. And then lastly, our neighborhoods. This is a new use. There were a lot of questions, which is why it is so important that we have the community informational meeting in here.That is not the sum total of community outreach, but it happens before the application goes in and the application has to note what feedback came from that meeting and how it was addressed. That's a first for those of you keeping track of our land use process.We don't require anyone else in our land use. So I got questions about that. Actually from Inter Neighborhood Cooperation, they said, Is it fair to ask our most vulnerable project to do more than we ask other developers and others to do?And the answer for now is yes, because this is a new use and people need more time to learn about it and understand. But it is incumbent upon our neighborhoods to engage in this conversation with good faith and with open hearts.Everybody in our city deserves a chance to live in a home. It might be next door to you. The desire for something to always happen somewhere else is not realistic. And so I ask our neighborhoods to think about learning about these homes now, maybe before a project is proposed tour, a supportive housing project now and get tounderstand why those services create a greater amount of safety, both for the residents who live there as well as for your neighborhood, than it does when you're living in an alley right in your vulnerable and you are a potential victim and you are highly traumatized on a daily basis.So I call upon our neighborhoods to help make the final step of this possible, which is by engaging in good faith and helping to welcome these and learning about them and preventing rumors from spreading and using your sincere desire to shape how you can be related to this.There is a lot of room to shape the relationship here. I do commend Globeville for being at the table to help say, here are some things about how this site could be designed and how these things could be shaped.And I hope every neighborhood will step up and engage with those ideas. With that, I thank my colleagues for their consideration and urge a yes vote tonight. Thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Hines.Thank you, Mr. President. It's kind of difficult to go after Councilwoman Kane each those very powerful. Thank you. Denver. We can do better. As we heard last November, we can do better. So thank you, Councilman Kane Cannick, for your foot and a half of movement, which is a lot of work to move it a foot and ahalf. And thank you all of all the people here today who spoke in support of it and all the people who aren't here today who did a lot of work to make this happen as well, that you're bringing this text amendment forward.I also want to thank the district ten residents who are here today who came tonight and support call it perfect ten for a reason. And you're helping me realize how perfect perfect ten is. Mr. Ramsey, I hope I pronounce that correctly.It's specifically you who stated that you would be happy to have a tiny home village on your block. As Councilwoman Kennedy said, we need our neighborhoods to come forward. And we need to all of us, we need to make make a commitment to all of us as humans.And I would make the same commitment. I would be happy to have a tiny home village on my block as well. I think diverse neighborhoods are make better neighborhoods. And and I think that the some of the neighbors who who have concerns are in neighborhoods that have that are very homogeneous.And as we as we diversify our neighborhoods, I think we we've become healthier as a city. We've become healthier as a neighborhood. And frankly, I think that we've become healthier as individuals as well. So. This is as Councilwoman Kennedy showed in her and her visual.This is just one more tool in the toolbox. I look forward to considering additional tools as we in Denver continue to do better. As we do better. I'm excited to see a model that that treats residents as partners and success.And and I wish you success with my yes vote.Thank you, Councilman Consommateurs.Thank you, Mr. Chair. I also just want to thank everyone for coming out in support of this ordinance and the work that Councilwoman can each and CPD all put into this? Mr. Hazen I think it was it's something around who would love to see this, the city embrace this, and I would like to echo that.It is going to take all 78 of our neighborhoods to really embrace the potential of what this has and the potential it has to change people's lives. Mr. Chandler reminded us how zoning in our history in Denver was used to exclude people, and it will only change when we actually use zoning to include folks.So thank you so much. We still need a number of solutions. I love Councilwoman Nature's Spectrum of all of the housing solutions that are required and all of the parts that play a role in trying to address this true crisis.I really want to thank also the Denver Foundation and Ms.. Virginia for helping to fund these efforts. These are not free. These are not easy and they are temporary. So it does take investment and and belief that this actually makes a difference.This isn't a singular solution. It's one way to give stability and peace to a small group of people who only need a chance to figure out their next step. Tiny home villages may not be for everyone experiencing homelessness.They are for those for whom it does work a roof in a place of their own that can and will change their lives. So thank you all so much. Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilwoman Councilman Cashman.Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank our members of our unsheltered community and their allies for for the grace and courage with which you've leaned into this topic, especially in recent years. You've created a movement, and it wouldn't have been done without you.I want to congratulate Cole Chandler on the addition to your family. Hope your child is healthy and happy and carries your spirit of service. Thanks for what you do. Councilwoman Canete, his outstanding work. Thank you for your leadership on this.So this is an amazing evening. President Clark and I and maybe some others on the previous council will remember a gentleman named Bob Sperling who came around to council four years into the planning department lobbying for accessory dwelling units.And when he first came around, he was just shoot away. You know, it was kind of like, what are you even talking about? He, unfortunately, some months ago passed away after a brief battle with ALS and now on a somewhat regular basis.Now we're talking about this new tool to increase our housing stock, and I find that very exciting. A number of us went to Austin, Texas, this summer to visit their community first village, and they had 51 acres on the first 24 acres.They've got 225 tiny homes and mobile homes and RVs, and they're just started developing the remaining 27 acres for another 300 units. And they have a they're building a 20,000 square foot health center, etc., etc.. So we came back very motivated and wondering how do we replicate that?Does it have to be on 51 acres? Can it be done high rise? Can it be done in different just a different format? And what we're getting ready to vote on tonight provides us at least a shot at that.You know, and I like so much the idea of of individual homes rather than apartments in buildings. You have a you know, while they're certainly not large, they're your own. The door locks, there's space around it. You can sit on your porch and, you know, look out at whatever you care to look at.This is just a wonderful tool and it's such a fitting thing that we're talking about these both of these new additions to our housing stock. And as I would say to Mr. Chandler and say to our tiny homes, may you multiply.Thank you.They just mean cash and Councilman Ortega.Thank you, Mr. President. I want to piggyback a little bit on what Councilman Cashman was just saying. I was one of those council members who got a chance to go to the Austin community first. Residents. And to see how they have incorporated social enterprises into their living environment was was pretty exciting.But really what we saw was a community and that's what we see at the beloved tiny home village as well. And that is so much different than putting an individual in a unit because sometimes they lose that sense of community that they've had, that camaraderie, that that that has been built with the people they've been living onthe streets with. And by creating what's more of a community environment, it it gives the individuals that support that is needed. Yes. The all the support services are important, but that sense of of community and belonging is equally as important.And that's part of what I have seen that our beloved tidy home village has created. Sokol I want to thank you and your board for really moving the needle on this conversation, being part of the group living conversations and elevating this to be part of that agenda and making sure that the committee that worked on on thisparticular section just kept moving the needle on it. Councilwoman, for for taking it across the finish line as you. Articulately elaborated on. But I think the importance here is that we have a shelter system. We have some supportive housing.We've got a lot of market rate housing. We need the layers in between so that we have all the right options for people that are coming out of our shelter system, that are working, that need to get into stable housing, that people who leave the tiny home village can get into housing that's affordable.And again, yes, it does take a while to get through, you know, the tax credit process in making sure that we've got the affordability built in, but really having the continuum of options for people at different stages in their life so that we're ensuring that we don't have people returning to the streets because we have it addressthat continuum of options. So for everybody who's been involved with this, I just want to say thank you to our our staff at CPD. Andrew, Jill, Tina. You guys have played an important role in, in shaping all of this and moving the needle as well.So I'm going to be supporting this tonight. I'm excited that we will have the opportunity to show folks that this really works. And, you know, we've got people in the Lincoln Park neighborhood who will be seeing, you know, something happened with the Burnham yards.And they're one of the communities that said, pick me. We'd like to have a tiny home village in our community as one of the options on this site, assuming she doesn't take the whole site when they're talking about, you know, creating some new route for the I-25 corridor.But I think this gives us the opportunity and the fact that we have so many large churches around our city that are being underutilized, that have huge parking lots, I think this creates tremendous opportunity for options all across the city where it's not just one neighborhood or one part of the city being asked to, you know, todo their part in helping make sure that we've got these opportunities here. And the last thing I'll say is. In Austin. I know when I've had a chance to travel to Europe and saw a tiny home village. These are communities that the larger community is very proud to have in their neighborhoods and to be able to saythis is ours. And I think Denver has one and can have others, and it's not going to be for everybody. But having that as one of the options will give all those people who get to take advantage of them the opportunity to stabilize their lives.Thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Gilmore.Thank you, President Clark. You know. There's really no.Opposition.So congratulations on on a really robust community engagement process and want to support and acknowledge the work of the community first and foremost, because you do that work every single day. I want to also acknowledge, you know, Cole, Andrew, Jill and Councilwoman Kenney each and hopefully, you know, being one of the council.Members who attended the trip when we went.To Austin, Texas, and toured the community first village.You know, a lot of that.Education and experience will always stay with us. That being said, I think there's benefit to other city individuals or other council members going and visiting and kind of seeing that model.Because one of the things with their.Model was that they were also generating income for the residents. And that was so meaningful because you were validated that if you're creative or you make artwork or you make sculptures.Or you make jewelry or whatever it is that is.Your livelihood that you know in your heart is your life livelihood. They were able to really foster that. And I'm hopeful that with some time under our belts that we could look at more permanent solutions for these villages, because it's not unheard of that somebody might do improvements on a parcel of land that they never intend toown.They are only making those.Improvements so that they can operate and then someone else owns that land into perpetuity. It could be a corporation, it could be a developer. And right here in the permitted.Zone districts, we have churches, community centers and cultural.Facilities. And so what would.That model look like that.This investment.That is not a small.Investment could be valued for years and years to come.And I'm just curious as to.You know, following this trajectory and hopefully, again, we get a little bit of time under our belts and so that we can look at this maybe in another way after we see how this one works and where there might be others through the city.But, you know, it's troubling to me that we might have a significant initial investment that would be moved around every four years throughout the city without truly being able to realize and and really partner with maybe those churches or community centers or cultural facilities to support more individuals for a longer term duration.So congratulations again to everybody. Looking forward to seeing how this moves forward. And my one ask would be, please allow us. However, we might invite our registered neighborhood organization leaders, our community leaders in a respectful manner again. But just people need to see it and they need to meet individuals and really, truly understand.And so I make that ask and I'm here to always help and support. So congratulations again. Thank you, President Clark.Thank you, Councilwoman. And thank you all for coming, for being here, for engaging in the process and for sticking with us as the night gets late.

With that, we're moving on to the next item, which is 42.Communication from City Attorney Recommendation to declare ordinance. Amend the Long Beach Municipal Code relating to hotel worker safety precautions read and adopted as read citywide.Okay. There's a motion in a second. Councilman Price.Thank you. If I could just have clarification from the city attorney on what the passage of WW will have on this ordinance, or vice versa.Yes, Mayor. Members of the Council. With the passage of measure WW. That measure is more restrictive and applies by its definition to hotels or as they define hotels in that initiative of 50 rooms or more. So all of the provisions of that initiative will go into effect pursuant to the election code after the county certifies and itcomes to the city council and it's certified by the City Council ten days after that certification. WW will go into effect. So the impact on this ordinance that's before you this evening then would be this ordinance would apply in essence to hotels as defined in this ordinance of 49 rooms or less.And it will also be changed. This ordinance has a an application period or it applies to rooms of 50 or more. Immediately that will be trumped and overruled by measure. WW. So in essence, this would apply to the 49 rooms or less, and they would have up to one year to come into compliance with this ordinance.Great. So as for the public safety piece, only the public safety provisions of WW would then apply to hotels of 49 rooms or less. It meaning panic buttons.I maybe misunderstood that. I think they would apply to 50 rooms or more. The panic buttons the panic buttons that are required by this ordinance would apply to 49 rooms or less.Right? That's what I mean. So this ordinance would augment that public safety piece and apply to a broader group.In essence all hotels and would be required to have the panic button.WWE of their.Size, regardless of their.Size. Got it. Great. Okay, well, I'm glad to be passing an ordinance tonight that takes care of the public safety piece and leaves no one vulnerable regardless of the size of hotel they work with. And I urge my colleagues to support this.Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember Austin.I second the motion and hope we can put this issue to rest for a while.Thank you, Councilmember Pearce.That'll be so easy. I want to thank at this moment, I want to thank all the workers and the community members that made Measure WW possible passing with 62% of the vote. I know that we've had a lot of discussion here.I hope that we don't have to have a long part of a discussion. But I did want to highlight that there were three different things that were really important to me someone who values writing good policy, who's been a director at a public policy organization for a decade.And these three things were that it did not include contract employees, that the issue that's in front of us tonight does not include a retaliation clause as it is read in measure. WW And that the retaliation part as well as the notification parts are not included.And it's my understanding that if we included those tonight that there would need to be a would have to start the clock over again. Is that correct?That is correct. If we amended it with those provisions, as you've just outlined, it would come back. We would need to rewrite it and it would come back for first reading.Okay. And I do I think that, you know, there's a lot of conversation around all of the items and. WW And so I feel confident that constituents and myself feel that these are really important. I know that my colleague, Councilmember Price, and I have had a couple of conversations.I wanted to ask you if we passed this tonight and came back and I believe it's 31 days with amendments, including all of these. Is that something that you're okay with?I, I would be more than happy to consider any amendments. And I think having a no retaliation clause and applying it to all employees, whether they're contract or not, is totally reasonable. So I'd be I'd look forward to seeing the language of any proposed amendment.But I really do want to close the chapter on this ordinance tonight. And as with any of our ordinances and our muni codes, we can amend them at any time to make them better, more robust, whatever we'd like to do.Okay. I know. You know, for me, this has been an emotional process. And there have been a couple of things that we said were really important to us. One was not doing this before the election, and two was that it included these items that I feel like really do protect hotel workers and make sure that if youhave a panic button, you're not scared to use it for fear of retaliation. So it's great to hear you say that you support those two items which are near and dear to me. I want to hear from my council colleagues before I take a vote on this item.Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember Richardson.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So two things. One, we just had a conversation about a motel ordinance that we're going to be crafting, and I'm sure there's going to be some outreach. And then this this ordinance going to pass tonight.Are there any opportunities to save some money and just have one outreach process that goes to, you know, all because we're talking, frankly, to all the motels about safety, really, that's the common denominator of safety. So can we have one?Is it possible to have one safety conversation as we go out and do outreach with city manager or development services? We just make a mayor councilmember.We can certainly do that, although these are kind of two separate items. So one would definitely be the ordinance that we just passed or that that you're dealing with right now. But I think we'd like to make sure they're on parallel passed, but we can certainly talk to folks at the same time when we're talking to them. I don't know what's going to be first when we get out there and talk to the the motels. But we can certainly do that. But I think ultimately we're going to probably do parallel paths to get the message across on both items.Okay. Because I think there's value. There's value if we're going to engage because some of them are difficult to track down and find some of these these motel owners, these operators, the small folks. I think it makes sense while we're there and we have their captive audience, if the city is going to require panic buttons for themwhile we're additionally requiring lighting or whatever is going to happen this new ordinance, I just think it makes sense for them to understand that all of these are important to the city, not, you know, one and then the other, and especially if we're talking each other the same way.That makes sense. Okay. Just wanted to make sure this wasn't way out of left field here and then and then the second part is just picking up the conversation. Councilwoman Pryce and Councilwoman Pearce, I'm you know, frankly, with the election behind us, I am looking forward to moving forward with one ordinance that makes sense.And I think it does make sense. I understand that folks want to move forward tonight. I get that. But what I'm unclear on those three things that you mentioned. And so one of them was, you know, if you're an employee, clean the housekeeper.If you're a housekeeper cleaning the room, whether you're, you know, paid for directly as an employee or you're a contractor brought in, the truth is just the same. You're going into a room with the same scenario. And so it sounded like there was consensus in your motion to ask staff to come back with these amendments.And 30 days we look at that when I understand that I would like to there is a there is a way here to adopt the ordinance and give staff direction to come back with it written out so we can evaluate it.No, I actually don't believe legally that that's an option.I, I agree. I think that tonight either your action tonight is either approve the second reading or tell me to change it however you'd like to change it. And we would come back and would come back for first reading.I think what I heard the councilmember from the second district say is, which I think is correct, is that this ordinance within 31 days after it's approved by the mayor would become effective at any point thereafter. You could amend it that day or bring back direct city attorney to amend with A, B and C or D, whateverit is you'd like to change. And we could do it at that time.So the 31 days was after it signed, after it's voted on. Tonight, it goes into effect after.You could amend it any time after it goes into effect.So any day after 31 days. So I guess my question would be, can we just give some direction and say bring that, you know, adopt the ordinance and then a separate motion in addition that says no, now we're post WW, right?We're post WW. There's an interest here in seeing some of those clarifications come back after it's fully implemented. So is there is there a way we can give directions? They make sure that this comes back after a month.I think that kind of brings people together saying both.I think the answer to that is no. I think you what? You either are going to approve an ordinance or are you going to tell me to amend it tonight? You can't do both.Okay. Good to see you, Tony. Thanks.Now some our.Councilmember Price.So I just wanted to say, I think once we approve it tonight and I know you know this, Councilman Richardson, so I'm not trying to like preach or anything. I'm just saying procedurally, I think what will happen is if we want to have an amendment, we'd bring a separate agenda item asking the city attorney to change theordinance to include this or that. We've done it for a couple of our existing ordinances already that maybe needed some fine tuning in the language so we can make it better or broaden it or whatever we want to do after it's approved.And then we can give them direction at that point through a separate agenda item.And if I may, Councilmember Richardson brought up the point of the employee on the contract. I think in our ordinance, we do cover both the employee and a contract employee who's cleaning. I think where we have a difference with WW is how we define a hotel employer, and that's not including the contract.And so I if I understood the councilman from the second District correctly, that is something she would like to add to include that.Councilmember Pearce.So to be just to clarify on timeline, I think we all want to kind of put the heartache and the pain of this behind us. I really would like to to be able to to vote to support this.And I think to trust that the council is there and that so that's kind of the process part. So. We have 31 days after the mayor signs it, then we can bring back the ordinance. We can't bring it back sooner than the mayor signs it.Well, I think you could bring back an action agenda. Is it at the next meeting or whenever after the mayor signs it? We would probably bring it back after the effective date to amend that ordinance. We don't have an effective ordinance to amend until that time, but you could next week put something on to say we wantto change it or in the next council meeting or whatever period time.And then the next question is on the timing. So the way that the ordinance is written is it's a 12 month implementation plan. So while it would be 31 days and maybe three months until we finally have a final change with the amendments, that's not to say that in those next three months, you guys are already goingto have.This rolled out.That's a great question. I think what we would do is if. If it's approved this evening. The ordinance allows these hotels that will fall under this ordinance up to 12 months to come into compliance if there's something that's placed on the agenda immediately or shortly hereafter.We would wait because we don't know what the council's going to do if you're going to be changing or before we start sending out some sort of notices to the employer, we don't want send mixed messages to the hotels.So we would probably wait. And something else you could consider if you are going to amend it is to extend that period out. And it would you would start the 12 month clock again or you could change that, you know, period of time.That was part of the original motion to allow these hotels to have up to 12 months to come into compliance so that they can, if it's a burden on them to purchase or how they're going to do it.And then my my next question is for city manager. Have you guys.Thought about how your outreach as.I know that no outreach has been done yet to the 12 motels are boutique hotels on my district yet.There's been no plan yet.So given that it's a long time that they have 12 months to be able to actually implement it.We looked to basically do business licensing, reach out to those. The latest I don't have a number of how many are 50.And below, but just for.Scale, the.Number of.Properties that.Have 100 or below is 40.So we're looking at a relatively small population that we would reach out to each one of them, and we could do that in writing and say, here's what the the ordinance was passed, give them a copy of a.Of a summary letter, and then, of course.Provide the ordinance so we could do that whenever you're ready.And I would I would also just recommend if there is going to be changes beyond if the if the ordinance is adopted tonight and if there's going to be changes, then those should be submitted as soon as possible, I would say.And so I think that you don't have to wait for a signature. You can submit that agenda item.That's what I was looking for.I think, you know, as soon as possible so that we know what the final product is. I would think so. Any other public comment or I'm sorry, public comment on this item is seeing none. Let me go back let me go back to the council on the other council.Then let's go ahead and do the roll call vote by. I'm sorry, is there is there a comment, by the way, that a comment from Councilor Mongo or.Yeah. Yeah.Go ahead.Sorry to interject myself here. You know, one of the biggest issues that we had with his ordinance right from the beginning was that it was our belief. My belief that it was for the structure, poorly written. They're not really as comprehensive as WWF.From what I'm hearing now is that if we were to adopt this ordinance, it would take us that much longer to reach a middle ground that would be acceptable to everybody. I don't see that happening. I think that this ordinance still has issues we still need to work on.Any of that is in fact what we want to do with the passage of WW. I think we have a good ordinance there that we can abide by. While it might be a good thing for the this this ordinance to pass to deal with the hotel, hoteliers that are 49 rooms and under is still not it's notas comprehensive as we had been arguing for for the last year. So just to let you know that I'm not supportive of it and that's where I want to.Okay. Thank you, Councilmember Councilwoman Price.Thank you. And I appreciate Councilman Randy's comments. I do want to take a moment to thank and appreciate the work of Linda Vu, the attorney who helped draft this ordinance. I completely disagree with Councilman Arango regarding whether it was poorly or properly drafted.I think it was drafted very well. And ironically, much of the language was exactly the same as WW. So a big thanks to the city attorney's office for ensuring that there was consistency and synergy on the public policy piece.I want to make sure that our city staff gets the recognition they deserve for doing the work that we've asked them to do, even if we don't agree with the premise of what they were asked to do. Thank you.Okay. Thank you. I do have a broader question, Mr. City Attorney. Maybe this is to the city manager. It's just more of a compliance question. I know that, you know, regardless of the outcome tonight and if this passes and then the broader question about all the hotels, including the smaller ones, is do we have a strategy onthe compliance side? I think there is some compliance language in the law in the broader WW language. And can you just speak to that? I've had some questions about that.Yes. Maybe the WWE does have a self help, basically section and enforcement mechanism. This would be fall under city staff through code enforcement and business license to enforce the provisions of this if there are violations by the hotels.And we can do that through administrative lines, through citations. And so that's how this ordinance would be affected.But as far as WWE is concerned, though, isn't there also a compliance piece that the the city is responsible for in the larger measure, or am I wrong?Currently there is is not. It does allow the city to consider adopting rules and regulations to if necessary. That's one thing after the implementation. If if, you know, we get down the road and have some experience with this and we believe that there's additional measures that the city needs to take to make sure that the hotels arecomplying with it. The city has the council has that ability to do so.Okay. Well, thank you. Let me go back, Councilwoman Gonzales.Thank you. So I just want to be clear as well that we will move this if this should pass and move forward, then if there is interest in create. So we. So basically we would have to create another agenda item versus just making the amendment tonight, but yet we would still be on the same timeline.The timeline would slip a little bit, right. Because if if it passes this evening, the process of it becoming effective begins in the 31 days. Clock would begin probably tomorrow. The if there's another agenda item to now modify what is adopted this evening, we would make those changes.It would come back for a first reading, a second reading on the amendment, and then the 31 days would start. So I don't have a calendar in front of me, but if we depending on when this proposed amendments come, if there's a three identified, they'd be pretty quick too for us to be able to return that backto council.And I know I can't predict the future. On what would happen if we move forward with another agenda item. But I just think that to have amendments now seems like it would be a little bit more expedient versus waiting for an agenda item.Hopefully it passes and then waiting some more time to get that implementation done. So I just wanted to be clear on that. Okay. Thank you very much. I too think that although we had a city staff member who generously provided language for this item, we appreciate that certainly very much.I do also think that there were components missing relative to the W.W. item, and I, too, am glad that voters certainly decided overwhelmingly about that item. So thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman Councilmember Richardson.Just just one additional thing. So I think and I liked that the conversation got really narrowed to just what's the difference between, you know, this and WW and what I'd like to see. So we move forward with this ordinance tonight.But what I actually see is just a very brief to form for that just outlines the differently the to to help support the crafting of what the amendments are. Because really we're talking about two or three very narrow changes that make that aligns it with.WW The differences between this ordinance and WW.I think pertaining.To the public safety.If you're only talking about. Yes, there is the other provision of the work search.Yes, yeah. Without talking about that piece, just talking about the safety side, I'm really interested in how they're like seeing the language or how they're different. So can we have just the two front four come back just talking about the differences in those two.Yes.Okay, Councilwoman, you go with that. The memo. Okay. So you set that friendly. Thank you.Okay. Thank you. See no other comments and no other comments from the outside. Location. Madam Clerk, please call the room.Councilwoman Gonzalez. Councilmember Pierce. Councilwoman Price. Councilmember. Super Now. Councilwoman Mongo. Vice Mayor. Andre. Councilmember. Councilman Austin. Councilmember Richardson. Did we hear from.I think that was everyone but Councilman Mongo.Councilwoman Mongo.I. Oh, there she goes.I better say that.Okay. Thank you very much. Motion carries. Moving on to the next item, 32.\nSummary:", "answer": "Recommendation to declare ordinance amend the Long Beach Municipal Code by adding Chapter 5.54 relating to hotel worker safety precautions, read and adopted as read.  (Citywide)"}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nMotion carries.Thank you. Item number 12, please.Item 12, Communication from Councilwoman Price. Councilwoman Gonzalez. Councilman Austin. And Vice Mayor Richardson. Recommendation to develop develop an outreach and education campaign regarding youth marijuana use and drug impaired driving.Councilwoman Price.Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. So I want to first thank my colleagues for signing on to this item with me. I believe this is a very important item because it's not going to allow the city to be very proactive in establishing some best practices moving forward.And I think it gives the city of Long Beach an opportunity to be a leader in the region in terms of partnership and collaboration between policymakers, law enforcement and leaders in the marijuana dispensary businesses. When we look at some of the outreach and education components that we've seen in other industries, let's say with alcohol, we see thata lot of the major manufacturers and and bars and places where alcohol is served have partnered in this concept of outreach and education by sharing messages, encouraging people to drink responsibly, being aware and mindful collectively that there are negative consequences associated with misuse of certain products and really coming together to come up with outreach and education thataddresses those issues. So I think where we are with with marijuana, especially in the state of California and in the city of Long Beach, is is very much in its infancy stage in terms of outreach and education, in fact, at a statewide level.There are requirements with the passage of Prop 64 that there be outreach that come directed from the state in regards to requirements for the industry to have warnings for the youth and things of that nature that are contained in the health and safety code.And so those changes are coming. But to my knowledge, there have been no local jurisdictions, no municipalities that have taken a proactive approach to the issue of outreach and education. And that's the intent behind this item. The item isn't to be intrusive or force anyone to do anything.It's really an opportunity to extend the olive branch and say, can we work together to meet our common goals? And I say that with with full understanding and fully admitting that I have had and continue to have some concerns regarding the impact, if any, that rolling out this industry will have on our existing city resources, our abilityto enforce license, etc.. Those remain concerns of mine. Having said that, I fully respect and appreciate the outcome of an election. And in fact, when residents have called me in the last weeks to say, is there going to be a dispensary on my street?As I've heard what I say to them, as this is what was voted into law. And I think we all need to be mindful that our new reality is one that came about as a result of the vote of the people.And I fully respect that. I think when there are differences of opinion on controversial issues, it's very, very important. And I make it my personal mission to try to find areas of commonality. And one thing I have found in studying this particular industry is that the owners of the businesses, the folks that are legitimate business owners whoare attempting to operate within the law, understand, respect and appreciate the goals of being proactive when it comes to drug impaired driving education and youth access. I think those individuals have shared with me repeatedly that they want to partner with the city in those efforts and in those endeavors and from the states that have participated in legislationthat has decriminalized marijuana, Washington and Colorado. In my conversations with law enforcement officials in those states and staff who works for the Department of Transportation in those states. One of the things that I've been told repeatedly is that the one lesson that they learned that they wish they would have done differently is come to the table earlierwith the marijuana industry to establish best practices. One example is that, you know, the state of Colorado, the Department of Transportation, came up with a series of public service announcements and they started broadcasting them, and they did so without coming to the table with the other stakeholders, namely the marijuana business owners.And one of the ads was found to be very offensive to users of marijuana. The portrayal and you can see it on YouTube, just marijuana, barbecue. Those are the keywords that you can type in to YouTube and you can see it.But there was a. Portrayal of a man attempting to, you know, basically fire up a barbecue under the influence of marijuana. And the gist of the PSA was, you know, trying to barbecue your food under the influence of marijuana is legal.Driving while under the influence of marijuana is not. And what happened with that ad is it was very funny, but the marijuana industry and the users found it to be very offensive. They felt that it portrayed the users in a very negative light.So the state actually had to pull back that ad and had wasted a lot of resources in creating the ad and marketing the ad. So my hope is that this is not one of those functions. There are several functions that the state has that are exclusive to the state.A regulatory functions that are exclusive to the state. Education and outreach in the area of marijuana use is not something that is. Limited to the state. Local jurisdictions can get involved in establishing best practices for the marijuana industry.And so the intent behind this item is for us to work with our health department. And I know that Kelly Collopy is here. I see her in the audience. I've talked with her quite a bit about this item.I think she understands the intent behind it, and I'm happy to answer any questions about the intent. But the intent is really to bring everybody to the table, make sure that everyone is on the same page in regards to the content of education and outreach for two simple objectives.And the first is to try to encourage educate the youth about the chronic use of marijuana on the developing brain, the adolescent brain, and and also to encourage their parents or teach their parents safe access. If marijuana is being used or disseminated to the children for a drug or medical drug and to educate people that driving underthe influence of marijuana can be dangerous and can have negative effects. The state of Colorado has seen its pre the passage of recreational marijuana. 15% of drivers that were stopped at a roadside checkpoint were found to be under the influence of marijuana.Now that number is between 35 to 40%. So they've definitely seen a rise. And when you ask them, what would you have done differently, they would have said we would have come to the table earlier with the marijuana industry to figure out how we can do a better job of educating and providing warnings.So that's the intent behind the item. And I'm one of the things that I've heard is since I introduced the item, I did reach out to the Long Beach Collective Association, who has honestly been fantastic. They gave us some recommendations for how we can improve the item and we included some language in there specifically at their request. And I am told that they're actually working actively with the city right now to help the city become to help the city with potential opportunities for education and outreach in regards to future funding. So for any marijuana business owners who, you know, have not been part of that discussion, who are out there either listening to this orin the audience, please let us know if you haven't been part of that discussion, because we would like you to be part of that discussion as we develop the content and the outreach. And that's basically the the intent behind it.As our city manager often says, this item is not meant to be a contentious one. It's motherhood and apple pie because it's designed to talk about how we can do a better job working together to address common goals that we all have, which is safe access, education, and fewer DUIs.In terms of what we can control here as a local municipality. So again, I want to thank my colleagues for signing on to this item with me. What I would like to see when staff comes back in regards to an update is, is on behalf of the city attorney's office to what is permissible in terms of thecity's working in partnership with the dispensaries to develop guidelines and practices. If we were to provide these items together and they voluntarily disseminated them at the dispensary, certainly that would be allowable. Can we request that? Can the state of Colorado and I'm not sure if the state required this or if the dispensaries agreed to do it, butthe dispensaries have really partnered with the local government in terms of outreach and education. They have, for example, in one situation there's a video game that plays a short video about drug impairment. And if the player of the video game answers the questions that come along with that message correctly, then they get a free video game.It's actually a video game machine in the dispensary. To what extent that's feasible in our dispensaries, really? I guess that depends on the dispensary, the size of the dispensary, the willingness of the owner to partner with the city.But I can tell you as one policymaker here in the city that efforts to partner with the city on things that are important to all of us goes a long way. And I'm certainly hopeful that the people who plan to operate in the city take the responsibility that we all have for public safety very seriously and partnerwith us to the extent possible in terms of outreach and education. So that's the intent behind the item. And and finally, it's going to take a little bit of seed money to start this. I know that our health department is going to be pursuing a grant, and I'm hopeful that they get the grant.But I think that a successful education and outreach campaign that can last the city many, many years can be done from with 50 to $100000. And so I would ask as part of this motion that the city manager identify one time funds that can be used for education and.Outreach that can be used for years to come in the area of drug impaired driving and youth access or adolescent use of marijuana.Thank you. I'll add my comments here and and go through the list. But Councilwoman Pryce, I just want to say thank you for asking me to come join you on this on this motion. And, you know, on this issue, we've seen a lot of, I don't know, conflict on the council about the right thing to do.But on this specific issue, I agree with you 100%. As as we move forward, new new terrain, new territory. And I know we've seen different iterations of medical medical cannabis in Long Beach. What hasn't changed is everyone's commitment to youth and to and to public safety.And in our conversations with the proponents, in our conversation with staff and public safety, it's always been guided from a lens of how do we protect our kids? How do we protect public safety? And I do believe education is the key.I think, you know, and I've said this before, I do believe in collaboration and leadership. And I'm asking, you know, that, you know, the the industry really step up here. And and I know that they will and step up.And we're looking for more collaboration and more leadership, particularly on this issue. And I know that with the measure in May, the council supported a measure that was, you know, in in the language. We encouraged that that funding to be directed to the health department with, you know, one element of that would be education.So we certainly want to make sure that that happened. And I know that our health department has already taken some steps to begin crafting and scoping what that could look like. I like the part of the recommendation about funding to get started one time funding.I see it a little bit differently. I see it more so as like gap funding until gap funding until the measure m a funding comes together. But I think the best thing to do is just look at how the city manager look at where those options are and to have the health department continue what they're already doingin terms of education. But but I'll say I think you're on the right this is the right direction, and I wholeheartedly support it. Councilman Austin.Thank you. And I want to speak and my support to this item as well. And I think thank you, Susan Price, for for bringing this forward. As chair of our public safety committee with somebody who is also somebody who's very, very astute and attuned to to this issue from a public safety perspective, this is a new dayin the city of Long Beach and in the state of California. The voters have spoken loud and clear on a statewide level, as well as the local level. And I'm I'm glad. I mean, we mentioned that there was a lot of disagreement in terms of how we get there on the council, that sometimes the residents get itright for us. And so I'm glad that that that item actually went to the ballot. And we have clear intent of the voters. This is a no brainer for me. This is a proactive this is a responsible approach.We have done proactive, responsible public policy and governance around all kinds of issues, similar through Matt and other campaigns, to discourage youth from smoking and drinking and doing things that are going to harm them. And so this is, like I said, a very, very much a no brainer.And it should be done here on a local level because we have a local ordinance that that that that went to the voters. And so I will be supporting this wholeheartedly. I think the intent is to we don't know what the best practices are.And so this is an opportunity for Long Beach to establish some best practices in governance and, you know, be a leader in the state. And so I'm supportive of this idea. Thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez.Yes. Thank you. I'll also be.Lending my name to support this as well. I think if anybody knows.This arena, I would say.Councilwoman Pryce certainly does.And what's great about this, as we've talked.About, is that we can be collaborative in a sense, to educate our, you know, the public to ensure that they.Are well informed with the the.Risks.And also just educate educated about what to do here in the city of Long Beach, especially.When it comes to our.Youth.And so I look forward to hearing more about.What specific grants we could obtain. Also, just clarifying, because I know some of the language is already.Already in the measures. So I know this emphasizes and reemphasize is what will we'll be doing in terms of awareness.And I look forward to hearing more in the next six months. Thank you very much.Thank you, Councilwoman Pierce.Yes. Thank you so much, Councilmember Price, Richardson, Gonzalez and Austin for putting this together. Of course, it's a no brainer. We want to make sure that we're working really hard to engage as many people as possible in educating them on safe practices.And so I commend you, Susie, for all the work that you've done on this. You guys have done a lot of research on here. Can you guys hear me? Yeah. Okay. So I did have a couple of I appreciated your comments and wanted to just clarify with the city attorney on a couple of things.You had mentioned, Suzy, that you had said that you didn't want this to be a requirement laid on top or something, forcing them to do this. It's the way that it's written right now. Is that a requirement or would I need to clarify if we wanted to tease out having this to be a incentive program?Well if mayor members of council Councilmember Pearce the I think what the council member Pryce mentioned is correct, that this was a voter initiative. And if you make it or attempt to make it a requirement, then I think you run afoul of trying to amend the ordinance as adopted by the voters.And so the way I understand the intent of the motion, not that this would be a collaborative effort in working with them to get those items that we can agree on in that they will voluntarily do. There would not be an enforcement mechanism coming out of this policy, if I understand the motion correctly.So it would be it would be to work with them on education, which clearly the city could do with or without the dispensaries. They could put it on the website, they could put out educational material. And then that other component that was discussed on working with them would be a voluntary component.And if there were dispensaries that participated in an education drive, would there could we add a a page on our website that says these dispensaries are participating in the city drug education component?Yes, you could certainly look at that as part of the program or some sort of an incentive program and bring that back at any time. That's correct. But that's not a part of this motion.That's not a part of this motion. Okay. That's helpful for me. The second part I wanted to address is just the fact that it says that, you know, creating a sticker and that already is in. Mm. So we an incentive sticker maybe it would be an opportunity for us to say here's the top folks that are participating. And the second piece is the training session video. I would love as we're exploring best practices with, you know, some of the alcohol education drives, including our parks and rec people that are engaging with our youth at our parks.I know Bixby Park, we have hundreds of kids in there every day ensuring that it's not just on parents or teachers, but people that they interface with on a regular basis would be something that I'd want to ensure we look at.And then I just wanted to flag one other thing. When we look at the studies that were pulling this out of I know that there isn't a best practice yet for marijuana education, but there are best practices for alcohol, for narcotics and everything else and really trying to pick the best of the best.I believe one of the studies that's mentioned in here is the Every 15 minutes program, which there's several studies that came out afterwards saying that while it raised awareness, it didn't it wasn't rooted in changing behaviors. And so as we're looking at best practices, if we can really make sure that we're looking at education programs that helpchange behaviors. So it's not just a a feel good we spent all this money on education, but that we're reducing the amount of drug intake or we're actually reducing the amount of people that are driving under the influence.So with that, I would like to make a friendly amendment. If council member will accept it to direct staff, to look at a incentive program that would say that if they participated in this program, everything from the videos, the trainings, that we would then create a sticker that they could put on their door, their window to say, we also participate in educating our youth, or we're a member of the Long Beach City Education Drive and that those businesses be listed on the city website so that we can really highlight those that are trying to go forth and and do one additional step.Would you accept.That? Absolutely.I think that's fantastic.Fantastic. Thank you. Councilman Andrews?Yes, fine. Thank you. My summer, I think, for the first time that Susan and Mrs. Price, you know, I listen to a lot of things that I know it's going to take a long time. But this time I didn't mind taking the long time because you hit it.I think you hit this you hit this one on the nose, Mrs. Price, because the fact that you're working with the collaborators on this and, you know, you didn't just go out there and just down the cross by yourself, but you have people behind you on this.And I think everyone needs to be educated when there's a project going. That's a situation where we need to be educated and you let us know that we can work together. And by doing that, I think the people that we're going to, you know, be working with, with these are the dispensaries.I think that they're in agreeance also because, you know, I don't care how much education you we basically do with our kids or anyone else. You know, education basically to me, I think comes from the home. You know, we can tell our kids anything we want to tell them.But, you know, it starts at the home. And I think you guys, you have to understand this. This is great that you have this. And I think this is going to be good for all of us. But I think now we decided we're going to work together.And this is the first time I've ever seen you up here doing this and I think is going to work and we're going to get this thing moving forward and get it out of the way. Thank you, Mrs. Price, for not even asking me to be on this, but I put myself on it.Thank you.I think that was a compliment. I'm sure I will say I have no problem dying on the street if I think it's the right thing to do. So that is my personality. But with this issue, I again, I think finding where.You have the floor. So go for it.Yeah, sorry. I saw that I was up, so.It's.Fine. I think that on this one where we can find commonality on a controversial issue, that's a win win for everyone. I will say I really like the recommendation that Councilwoman Pearce just mentioned about the incentive program. You know, one of the things that this is a little bit analogous to is some of the efforts of ourbar owners to collaborate. So I know that we have informal groups of bar owners on Second Street, for example, who set expectations and standards on themselves above and beyond anything the city would ever ask them to do. For example, they have a dress code policy.They have they will sign up their employees to take a class through ABC for responsible service of alcohol. And these are things the city doesn't require them to do, but they do it anyway. And I know they do it because they tell me they do it because they're in my district and they want me to know thatthey are taking efforts to to address public safety. And so so I like that and I'm looking for things like that in the spirit of collaboration, if we're requiring somebody to say, you know what, driving while impaired under the influence of a drug can be dangerous, and they're only doing it because they're required to do it.Then I think it's really disingenuous for them to say they're partners with the city. I mean, honestly, if you really if you're going to get in this business, then let's do it responsibly. Let's do it together. And let's not be in a situation where Colorado has been where they've seen their DUI numbers double because they weren't proactive. So let's do that. And in regards to every 15 minutes I participate in every 15 minutes. I've been doing it for 11 years now and every quarter I participate in every 15 minutes. And I can tell you, if we were able to develop an educational campaign like every 15 minutes for alcohol, it would be very, very impactful. I can't tell you how many kids write me letters after I do an every 15 minutes program and tell me that the presentation changed their lives. So I don't know what studies Councilman Pearce is referring to, but the California Office of Traffic Safety has been funding the every 15 minutes program for two decades.And my personal experience, I'd love to see the studies, but my personal experiences, I do it four times a year, have been doing it four times a year for over ten years, and it's incredibly impactful. The kids often say that it's changed their lives forever.So if we could do something like that for marijuana and and really get the staffing together to do it or get law enforcement agencies in the region to participate in it, I think it would be fantastic. And that's kind of what I was thinking of when I came up with the with the idea.So thank you, Mrs. Price, for taking and carrying it on. I just thought maybe that was my idea, but that's okay. That's it, right? That's it.All right, let's get back some control of this meeting. Councilwoman Mongeau, please.So just a thought I may have misunderstood. So maybe, perhaps Councilwoman Pearce could give me a lift. We want.To.Put a list of marijuana dispensary owners on the city website. If they meet a criteria. I would like us not to put any marijuana dispensary businesses on our website. I don't want to. I know that there are lots of businesses in my district that do a lot in the compliance.Area, whether they're dry cleaners.Who work out into the community to clean up the community and so on and so forth. And I just would love to not pick one industry to feature on the city website.So what my item, what my friendly is asking them to come back with an incentive proposal. Okay. So it might not be that that item hopefully will be listed as an option and we can have a discussion in the next six months about what an incentive program looks like for Long Beach.Okay. You know, I was toying with the idea like it's a business license is like, how do you get businesses to step up and do something more? You know, and part of that is saying, here's somebody that and I know, you know, having had lots of conversations about what education looks like, what a big what a goodbusiness owner in this industry looks like. And it's one that goes to neighborhood association meetings. It's one that participates, that participates with startup and everything else. And so how are we really creating an additional thing where if we are asking parents to be educated on safe use and we are asking youth and teachers to be educated onsafe youth use, I would rather direct them to somebody that has had their staff trained in those areas than one that hasn't. And so how do we you know that that's part of the discussion.It's a balance. So I appreciate that. I look forward to the discussion when it returns. I want to be mindful that we are working really hard to put together an incentive program for good landlords. We're looking to put together an incentive program for a lot of things, and our city website is one that is already.According to neighbors, difficult to navigate sometimes not because it's not well laid out. Our new website is very well laid out. This is just a very large city with a lot of information and a lot of businesses and a lot of city departments and a lot of people to reach out to.So I just want to be mindful of if we're going to go down this route with one business, let's make sure there's a best practice or a business industry. Let's make sure there's a best practice related to it because you could get into the same types of things with here are the shopping centers that have more safeparking than others. And here, I mean, it just could go a long way. So just to keep that in mind for the staff's perspective. Thank you. And I'm excited to support this item.Thank you. What a great conversation. Let's open it up to the public. Public comment. Is there any public comment on this item? Just go ahead and line up and we have 3 minutes. Go ahead, state your name and you have 3 minutes.My name is Victoria Marshall. First gave an honor to God. I'm a medical marijuana patient and I use marijuana because I had a car accident that I had to get my jaw. Basically, I had to have orange bars put on the air to realign my jaw and different things of that nature.And they provided me with narcotics that made me more impaired where I could not take care of my child physically. So I turned towards marijuana to help me with that. Now, a couple of years back, Long Beach had Miracle Metal medical marijuana dispensaries here.But you guys start right now, for whatever reason, saying it was federal, state, whichever reason. But in that way, patients and people that was working there were getting arrested, getting brought up on charges, having to flee out or whatever the case may be.So how is it that the dispensaries and also the patients supposed to trust a city that they said will protect us but also use it against us? So I don't want to be one of them, one that is inside the dispensary.When you guys turn around and say, okay, we don't want you guys in our city no more, we're going to say that we don't recognize you as a business. And then when they get raided. You guys turn your head.But you know, the patients are being arrested behind is. So are you guys going to turn around and say, we're for it one minute and then against it? Because you're not liking how the dispensaries are running their dispensary because it is optional, like you guys said.But if they're not complying with certain things that I feel are, you know, educational, would you guys turn around and say, okay, we're not going to recognize you as a business anymore? Those are things that maybe also you need to look at because I'm concerned as a patient that I could be incarcerated for wanting to get mymedication that helps me with my severe pain that I will have for the rest of my life. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Hello. My name is Joanne Freeman and I have a comment. Okay. I understand that the marijuana is being used for medical purposes. What about the issue of when I'm sitting at the bus stop or.When I'm.Over? Just throwing this out here as an example. Visiting. Okay. A friend of mine's that apartment. It doesn't happen in my complex. Sometimes it does. You smell it? Okay. You know, just like secondhand smoking is not good for you.What about that? What about the second hand smoke of smelling the marijuana and and having to go to another bus stop or or go to another train station because it's there in your face? I would like you all to look at what to do and come up with some kind of, I don't know, idea about ordinances or, you know, cameras or I don't know. It's it's just awful if you do not. And these are some of the some of the people who are doing this are minors. You know, they're just sitting there rolling it up, you know, and it's just just trying to nip the but, you know, before it gets really, really out ofhand. Thank you.Thank you. We're all trying to nip the but. Next speaker, please.How did that about?Very good. I go back to what I've always said in terms of medical marijuana. First of all, the medical marijuana card is as easy to get as a promise from an electric, you know, politician and during election time period.If we're going to have medical marijuana, we have one location for that. And that location is on the top floor of the Long Beach Police Department. Period. All right. If there are that many people that want to try it.What it tells me, aside from the medical marijuana issue. We don't have, although the city has a number of them, we need to triple the number of sports programs, period. I interface with very large numbers of people in various different sports.From. Junior high all the way up to college and beyond. I've never come across any of them involved in that. And so of course there's an is a life issue there and something's drastically wrong if we need that much, if our marijuana demand is so great that we need a a marijuana shop on every other corner.Secondly. What I'm going to suggest is that to control the. Use of it. Is that? The. Permit only be issued to people. That are in buildings. That have a positive track record and you have not had a record of attracting bad elements, period.And go after the landlord. And I'll use the specific example of the one that owns the grinding exit and the building next door. It's my understanding that they want to. I've heard from credible sources what I think is credible source that they the vacant building wants to be used as a medical marijuana place.Absolutely not. They've demonstrated with absolute clarity that they are not responsible landlords, period. And I'm sure we might find other people. So that's a litmus test that you use on this very face period. A again, to go back, we have one dispensary and that's on the top floor, the longest police department.Two. Let's double the number of sports programs and three. Under no circumstances give a permit to a property owner who has leased it out or owned a building that has never been notorious in terms of problematic. In other ways.Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please. Next speaker, please. If all the speakers could line up so we know how many speakers we have, please go ahead and continue.Hi, my name's Stephanie Morrison Sewell, second district resident. The specific educational components suggested by Councilwoman Price in this measure are all presently covered in the dispensary application process for Measure. Mm. I know this because I'm presently working on two of them down to the stickers, down to the youth interdiction programs.Those are all outlined specifically, and we'll be awarded points if they if the applicant cannot display them in their operating plan and security plans. That this leads me to believe within my professional opinion that Councilwoman Price is instead trying to use this legislation in order to find it legal, in order to establish a legal finding either fornuisance activity or, as the present is, marijuana establishing marijuana as a direct threat to public health. Something now for a form is a first step towards future targeted regulations against dispensaries. This is the same legal strategy of using land use policies that opponents of abortion use at collaterally tax clinics after their constitutionality was established by the SupremeCourt. The findings of councilwoman it is attempting to use are themselves this or the are themselves a discriminatory and reprehensible policy by declaring, despite evidence to the contrary, that marijuana duties are an immediate threat to public safety. She's laying down the legal and political precedent needed to justify an increase in staffing levels to the police, as wellas further use of racially discriminatory checkpoints, all under the pretext of preventing DUIs. The studies cited by Councilwoman Rafael Price, within the context of this particular measure, actually show a decrease in teen use in legal states. This has been done both by the National Drug and after the NRA, as well as the Colorado state government.Within that defined some of the more recent findings, marijuana use in the past month among eighth graders has dropped significantly in 2016, from five down to 5.4%, from 6.5% in 2015. Daily use among eighth graders has dropped in 2016 2.7%, 4.11%.And in 2015, among high school seniors, 22.5% reported marijuana use in the past month and 6% daily use. Both measures remain relatively stable and legal states from 2015 rates of marijuana use in the past. Use among 10th graders also remain stable compared to 2015, but are their lowest level in over two decades.What we're finding out is that marijuana use in legal states, marijuana use is remaining flat. Meanwhile, tobacco use and alcohol use to actual deadly drugs are falling down in that in the same in those same respects. That could be, again, a collateral, a court and correlative effect.But if anything, if there is a cause and effect right now, perhaps licensing more of these establishments would be a good idea. Frankly, if we want the Health Department to be taking a more proactive use of this, I highly recommend that they actually start issuing the county cards to provide medical marijuana for medical marijuana patients.As this right now, this provides me as a parent, parental rights prevents the district attorney from taking away my child or anybody else on the basis of purely being a marijuana user. Thank you. If you want many.Parents, thank you. We have to be respectful of the line. But thank you. I think, Diana, you were the next. Okay. All right. Let's continue, please.Hi. My name is Nick Moreau. I'm a retired deputy sheriff and narcotics detective. I'm a resident property owner in the fourth district. I'm a court qualified expert witness dealing with drugs, drug use, DUI, cannabis, both illicit and medical.I'm on a National Institutes of Health study, a National Institute of Drug Abuse study on cannabis health, young adults, and a lot of the information that that gets put out. It's a five year study that we're about to renew.We're talking about education. We're talking about training. What we need to do is we need to keep the emotion, keep the agenda, and keeping the old inaccurate information out of the training programs. Law enforcement has had problems with training being decades old and not built upon.We've had a lot of a lot of studies. We talk about Colorado, Colorado, before they legalize marijuana. They did a they basically buried the community in. Field sobriety, checkpoint warnings, public public service announcements. They let the entire population of Colorado know that they were going to come after them.Law enforcement was going to be trained better. Law enforcement was going to be out there looking for it. And the results of that 2014 to 2015 were 1000 fewer DUI arrests overall, with nine additional from the previous year marijuana, DUIs.That's an that's an amazing achievement. Now, the population.Of Colorado fits neatly into the county of Los Angeles. So if we had a program in the city of Long Beach that was as effective as the Colorado thing, we would be shown as the forerunner. With that training, with those policies.What what I'd like to urge the council and urge anybody that's involved in the training is please any information that's over five years old. Please throw it in the trash can and start learning. The National Institutes of or the National Academy of Sciences just released a 300 page report that went over 10,000 different study, different scientific studies, and came up with a whole lot of conclusions that are exactly opposite of what we're teaching our police officers, what we're teaching our kids in school. So I'm offering my services. I was also on the Medical Cannabis Task Force, actually, both of them my my offer to to use my expertize or the resources that I have atmy disposal. I would love to be involved in this training program and really not pay lip service to doing to making Long Beach a focal point. I'd really like to have Long Beach be the example that the rest of the state follows with responsible regulation.We've been screwing it up for the last decade, and the reason why the voters voted for what they did is because the people that stood up here failed them. And that's why we have the situation we have today.That's why Prop 64 passed. That's why MRC was put into effect. So that whole momentum is moving towards. Thank you, sir. So thank you much for your time.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Thank you. That we are having this discussion in an academic. Way that we having this discussion in this chamber. Is a testament of the darkness that is covering this world in this city. I'm looking at, ladies and gentlemen, who are who have been given by your voters, your constituents, voice, voice and legal authority here.But I'm also speaking to those with ears to hear, because you belong to the body of Christ in the church of Jesus Christ. Listen to me. If you have an ear to hear. It's getting dark now. Now we are discussing a way to make money.After the very, very thing that when Ronald Reagan, Reagan Democrats or Republicans, if you're in the House and Nancy said, just say no. We all nodded our heads and approved with her. And now we having this discussion. And I sat in front of a 21 year old whose mother, L.A. County deputy sheriff, sat in front of meand said marijuana was the gateway to now I'm a heroin addict now and I cannot help myself. Now we're having this discussion. If some of you your conscience just don't bother you yet. And darkness is covered. You now.And I understand. Some may still believe that there's a separation of church and state. But there is no separation. Some of us know it. And Jesus says, When I return, will I find faith anywhere in the earth? Will there be any faith anywhere in the earth?When I return. And the darkness is covering us now. When we can't open a shelter for the homeless. But we can sit here tonight and discuss ways, implementing stickers and tags on the windows, bumper stickers. The money that we are willing to pour into this immediately.And you can help your homeless. Don't you see the darkness is covering? Can you not see it? Do you not feel it? Hebrews says there is no authority accepted be given of God. And our chief said out of his own mouth that we don't have the officers to cover when those who are don't mean us any goodstart opening their own shops. We can't cover it. We don't have the officers. But we went over his head and we're doing it anyway. It is a testament against us as a city.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Adam Giles I'm.With the board of directors for the Long Beach Collective.Association. Good evening, Honorable Vice Mayor. City Council and City Attorney's Office on behalf of the Long Beach Collective Association. We wanted to thank you all and Councilwoman Price for bringing this educational item forward.We are taking proactive steps on an educational campaign to the public as a whole.Especially as the laws are being implemented and safe access is being restored in Long Beach.We are excited to work with the City Health Department and other stakeholders to.Roll out this program. We're in complete support of this item and if there are any questions or concerns were available to help answer those questions at any time.And once again, we want to thank you guys for this item.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Hi. My name is. My name is Ramon. I'm in District five. I have very little knowledge of this subject. I have not smoked any of this stuff. One guy up there. He wanted me to say that something about there's a county card and that people should issue the county card so parents can so parents can have parentalrights. I don't know what that means, but you have that. I've I've worked all my life in the the black world, the top secret world, all that type of stuff. And I've never had an opportunity to do all this stuff.I've also been an athlete, never had an opportunity. Every time I get drug tested, so it's impossible. So I'd just like to have everybody else have the opportunity that I never had. But one of the important things, I have a lot of friends who are police officers and in intelligence, and I would really they have a lotof knowledge in this area, believe it or not. And I would like to at least give them a little kudos to hopefully get them involved with some of the. Any mentoring programs or learning programs that you have? I'm really high on police officers and and getting them involved as well because they know.Trust me, they see all these guys all the time. The next recommendation I have, I have this friend, Tony. He's like a walking laboratory. He can tell you anything that he wants. He's way better than any psychiatrist. I know that.I'm just joking, but. Miss Pierce. Great. It looks like it's a great thing, you know, whatever you have here. So I support it. I think, you know.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Good evening again. Diana la logins. First of all, I would like to applaud your transitioning here from a very failed criminal issue to the Health Department. My concern in the first area is you're saying owners, collectives, you know, health department, etc..But again, you're not involving anyone that's actually a patient. You know, they're here. They're more involved than just about anyone. So that does need to be be included. So I would appreciate that. The the thing that concerns me the most is it it tends to continue the demonization of marijuana instead of there's a whole lot of statisticsout on how many of the other, shall we say, drugs are available, create deaths. Alcohol creates 88,000 deaths per year. Opioids, 27,000 deaths. All total. Pharmaceuticals, 55,000 deaths. Tobacco is the worst one of all. 48 excuse me, 480,000 deaths per year.But yet we're just focusing on marijuana. Now, I think I agree. I think there should be some some education in this. So I'm I'm all actually, I'm on board here. However, I think it needs to be across the board.Let's include all of these people because, you know, liquid drugs is is far more dangerous. And there have been no deaths, no known deaths from marijuana. So I would suggest that you get over the reefer madness and address the entirety of the situation.And I would like to see all of the entities that, you know, whatever it happens to be, whether it's cigarets or whatever, it should be all inclusive. It's not just and I and I can understand how, you know, how education can help in many, many, many areas.Okay. And I do believe that because I've been working on this for 20 years to and and, by the way, to address this young lady who was speaking about God, God doesn't make mistakes. No one should go to jail for a plant.And in that vein, the PD does need a little attitude adjustment attitude adjustment classes on the the issue. And so perhaps if you could include that, that would be a big help to everyone. Thank you very much. And I do support this with a few additions.Thank you.Thank you.

Manager's Emergency Action to temporary waive enforcement for a period of 90 days in alignment with the governor's executive order citywide.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Mr. Orth. He will give the staff presentation. Thank you, Mayor. Can you hear me? Thank you, Mayor. Members of the City Council. The global pandemic has created a disruption in manufacturing and the supply chain that has risen now to a national crisis.Cyber shipping containers, storage shortages is a byproduct of a confluence of many factors that have existed now for many, many months. To that end, Governor Newsom signed an executive order to address the storage crisis. Shortly thereafter, the city manager temporarily waived the enforcement of cargo container stacking for a period of 90 days.Parking is permitted in the city's industrial zones. Subject. However, it's limited in terms of the stacking limits within within one or two heights. There are no stacking limits within the port of Long Beach. According to the according to the the zoning designations that are exhibited here.Well, give me 1/2. There are over 4900 acres of potential space that's available for cargo container storage. However, that said. Based upon sparse research, we have found that there are approximately 37 sites potential businesses permitted to start containers within the allowable zoning designation.However, there may be unlicensed operators as well as inaccurate business license information. And we're going to research that and bring that back to you. More information within the 90 days period. Thus far. Um. Why this creating problems? Thus far, we've had no reported impacts to surrounding communities that have been that we haven't received any.We will continue to monitor and engage with the port for assistance should we have any issues that come up regarding any potential impacts. And we will be reporting back to you within the next steps to either extend, expand or in the 90 day period of time.Please note that specialized equipment will be needed to start containers which may limit the stacking activity. At this point, we're asking that that you receive and filed this report and approve the city manager's emergency action reports that is available here to answer any questions that you may have.Thank you very much. And that concludes that report.Thank you. I'm just coming up my screen ahead on main screen, I'm going to vote cast. Okay. Is there motion on this? The second. Okay. Councilman Austin, any comment?Okay. I mean, I guess, you know, understanding it. And I'd like to hear from the board as well before we actually vote. That's a possibility.Let's do that now.Comment. We can we hear.From.Report. And thank you for your consideration of this recommendation. I'm here to answer any questions you may have with regard to the global crisis that we are experiencing in the supply chain. So let's to say the nation's largest port complex has received the attention not only in Washington but in Sacramento.So we're doing the best we can to address the scenario that we have currently. I do believe that we will at some point move beyond this challenge and not only in the global global supply scenario, but also here domestically.So hopefully, again, this is a temporary measure to address a real crisis that we have in goods movement here in the United States.Thank you. Thank you. We don't we don't have questions at this point.Okay. No questions. Okay. Well, thank you so much and appreciate your support. Thank you, Mr. Cordero.Councilman, anything else?Sure. I wanted to just to say, obviously, these are extraordinary times where we the last year have had to make adjustments through our ordinances to support. Just about everything to maintain our economy, maintain our systems. And this is one of those adjustments that is maybe a little painful, but one that that I think we have to maketo support the, uh, the supply chain crisis that we're facing right now with our city. As you go out to the, to the beach right now and go along the boardwalk, you can see container ships lined up for as far as you can see them.If you take a flight and you come into Long Beach Airport, you can see these container ships lined up as far as you can see them. We need to have aggressive action to move this cargo, give back to a space of normalcy.And so I support this item and I think the council should as well. Thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman. And they are.Very supportive of this item. Thank you.Thank you all my comments here. So the the issue with capacity started well before they were car there were ships lined up four miles outside of there and there were pairs there were that created a rush for folks the same things as quickly as they could and broke things in a box and get out here and limitedcapacity for storage. And so even if you just drive over the Gerald Desmond Bridge and just look at the ports, and if you continue over to the Harry Bridges Bridge, you're going to see it, you know, cargo stacked up, levels higher than we've ever seen.And that's going to spill out. We're going to see that there's capacity going to be needed in the area surrounding the port all the way out to an inland empire. That's it. I think for a period of 90 days it makes sense.But we have to have a real conversation about is this really a 90 day deal? If they're in if if there's an indication that it moves beyond 90 days, there needs to be some public engagement in the neighborhoods surrounding these facilities.They're clustered in North Long Beach, the west side, and in some in areas around that are around the airport and these these neighborhoods. And I've looked at mine, there's only a few they're really adjacent to neighbors but we don't want to do is take these neighborhoods approval for granted.All too often the area, the neighborhoods directly adjacent to the ports are impacted by the operations. We've been heading in the opposite direction for a long time. And so what we don't want is for the way that we address this national crisis to be just on the backs of those who are most impacted.So as we think about this and other steps, let's just prioritize that the impacts on our local neighbors. We also have to have a conversation, some thoughts about what some of the air quality impacts are going to be as well.But that said, is there any public comments item?There's no public comment.Saying no members, please cast your vote.As with.

The loss is in excess of $5 million.To assist the investigation, the ATF contributed $10,000 or towards the reward for information leading to the identification and conviction of the subjects responsible. An additional $10,000 by the city of Long Beach would place the total at $20,000.

Recommendation to request the City Manager to work with the DLP to identify methods and estimated costs for activating the section of Victory Park adjacent to the former Jergens Building property, and also explore ideas and estimated costs of activating the parking lot at 100 East Ocean Boulevard.Thank you, Madam Clerk. Many of you are familiar with the southeast corner of Pine Avenue and Ocean Boulevard with its artwork on the wall. This portion of Victory Park has been closed off to the public for decades, which is a shame, as many of you have driven by given the potential for this corner to serve as afocal point for the city and for downtown, an innovative space that inspires tourists, conventioneers and residents to cross the great divide of Ocean Boulevard. Councilmember Gonzales and I believe we have an opportunity here to bring a temporary use to the site that breaks down the visual and psychological barriers to pedestrians.We have thought about it for probably years and decades. How to make ocean not seem so, so large, so wide and and so untenable. The debate, which I know Mr. Craig Cogen is here tonight, is willing is a willing partner dedicated to revitalizing public spaces and improving pedestrian activity.Each of you receive Dove's recent report. Each of you council members discussing the opportunities for temporary pop up retail at the corner. I thought April Economies did a fantastic job of showing us what's possible in the way of activation for this important corner.So what we'd like to see is the Dolby and city staff exploring those possibilities and bringing them back with cost estimates. From there we can discuss all the funding options available for that space. And with that, I'd appreciate your support.Councilmember Gonzalez.Yes. I want to thank you, Vice Mayor Lowenthal, for bringing this forward. I think it is very important that we are looking at this. The areas revision, revisioning is such a large piece of the Renaissance currently happening along Ocean and Pine Avenue in the downtown and a smooth transition in to our convention center.And nightlife is vital for tourists and employees, as well as locals who benefit greatly from continued growth in downtown the part of downtown Long Beach. This part has such a legacy and history, something that can be that can continue to be built upon and restructured in a modern, well-planned way.And working with the deal, Bay, will be a positive transition for the area. I know Council District One has worked on many projects with you all and we're excited to move forward with this item.Councilwoman Price.Thank you. I too am very excited about this. And even though studies cost money, I think this is a worthy thing for staff to study because I think this is a great item that will enrich and activate this area and give us some opportunities.So understanding that the staff is going to have to go back and come up with some alternatives for us, I think it's a very worthy investment in our city. And I want to thank my council colleagues who worked diligently to get it to this point.So thank you very much.Councilmember Urunga.I couldn't help it. I knew the opportunities there. Now, this is a worthwhile study.It did stop it.Going to come back with a real solution to a blighted area that we need to fix this. I totally support. I want to thank the council members who brought this forward because it's about time we address that block and that area.It is a very important aspect of what we want downtown to look like, and I'm looking forward to see how much we're going to spend on that corner. But as far as a previous subject, I know it's going to come back expensive and I know I'm going to vote it down.So anyway, thank you.So that's councilmember. You're on his way of saying I've left that corner blighted for far too long. Point taken, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Is there any member of the public that wishes to address council on this item?Please come forward. State your name.Hi.My name is Ryan, ultimate executive vice president of Anderson Pacific and also chair of the Public Realm Committee for the Derby. We're very proud to be working in partnership with the city on trying to re-energize this corner. That, as many is known, has been blighted and neglected for far too long.The Public World Committee is dedicated to public improvements that really work towards the benefit of the greater good and see this as a first step in the right direction. As you all may recall, the Urban Institute was commissioned by the DLB to come in to study the ways that we could improve the urban fabric of the community. And this is one of the recommendations that came out in terms of reengaging this corner and in bringing people back into the fold who are appreciative that part of our investment as well was in working towards funding this report by April kind of meetings that that demonstrated, I think, a very pragmatic approach to the solutions on thiscorner, which we do think will always.Work towards providing economic.Benefit. I speak more to the tourism aspects of this and obviously providing open space is much needed in the city. So I want to thank Councilmember Gonzales Vice Mayor Al Lowenthal for their stewardship in this and look forward to the future partnership together.Thank you.Thank you, Ryan. Is there any other member of the public that wishes to address the council on this item? Item 15? I also wanted to mention that this is an investment in this corner. I know this is a very prime corner, and it's one of those last unfinished areas that I think will complete our efforts in thedowntown. Although it's an open canvas, it's going to be very important. Part of the pop up strategy is to show potential to really market that corner in a way that having just an open space doesn't quite do. So I appreciate the support for the investment and really the creativity that the DBA and the Urban Land Institute andothers have brought forward and said that it's possible. It is possible and we can use it as a flex space and change it from time to time, depending on what the city and residents and stakeholders would like to see there.With that council members, please cast your vote.Motion carries nine zero.Thank you.

Thank you very much for your presentation. We'll turn to item 13 today, which is legislation which would, I guess, formalize a long standing celebration practice here that we have at the county in partnership with the public to honor Martin Luther King Jr.Our namesake, Andrew Kim is going to present on it. This is offered by Councilmember Gossett and myself. Thank you.Thank you, Mr. Chair. Andrew Kilmer, Council Central Staff. The staff report for this item begins on page 475 of your agenda. Get the ordinance before you. As you mentioned, Mr. Chair, would establish an annual gathering celebrating the life and legacy of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.Since the adoption of Motion 6461 in 1986 to change the namesake of the county to Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The county. And celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. King on an annual basis. And since 2004, the celebration has traditionally been have taken place at large venues.The proposed ordinance before you today would formalize this annual gathering. Since 2004, the annual gatherings have been coordinated by the Department of Executive Services with assistance from an inner branch team composed of representatives from county branches, departments, agencies and offices.However, in 2017, the Office of SGA, the Equity and Social Justice, assumed the coordination of the gathering due to some personnel changes. For 2018, the Executive modify the format of the public gathering to a conversation café, which explored issues of race, equity and justice in small groups of figures that was open to county employees.The proposed ordinance would require the Office of SGA in collaboration with an inner branch team to plan and convene the annual gathering. It would also require the gathering to be held in the second week of January, be open to all county employees and the public, and be held in a county venue that would accommodate all the attendees, the USDA and in collaboration with the inner branch team with widely publicized the gathering. And lastly, the proposed ordinance would authorize the use of county's general fund to fund the annual gathering. The Office of ESG Staff stated that the cost of the gathering would, as required by the proposed ordinance, would cost approximately $20,000 each year.And the Office of ESG Staff affirmed that they would be able to take up the work as required by the proposed ordinance and state that they have already begun planning for the 2019 Annual Gathering in collaboration with some representatives from the different branches, departments and offices.Lastly, Mr. Chair, staff has prepared Amendment One, which has been distributed to members to modify the statement of facts, to clarify the history of the gathering, and require the Office of ESG to invite, rather than convene representatives from the various offices and require the representatives to.Receive ideas and feedback from the community on the planning of the annual gathering. That concludes my remarks, Mr. Chair. We also have in the audience Matthias Whalen, director of the Office of ESG Advisor.And Andrew, thank you for your work on this legislation. Turn it over before I do. Councilmember Garcia just one. But I just I just want to say this historically has been one of my favorite things to do here at the county.The celebration has been inspiring and uplifting historically with musical presentations and awards to kids from around the county for essays and really also educational to remind us and to educate us, or at least me, about the work of Dr. King and to keep current and keep expanding my mind anyway, on issues related to civil rights, equity andsocial justice work. And this process that we are proposing be established would be to ensure that a broad representation of county employees continue to be involved in the planning and execution of the event. That it reflects kind of a broad perspective, that it involves the community, not that we are cementing any one particular type of celebration, butthat we are cementing a process to empower folks to ensure that we get a celebration, an event that is meaningful and and helpful to help us achieve our goals and missions here. At least that's my in my interest on working on this.And then if I could just work with those, I'd like to offer Councilmember Garza an opportunity as a as a sponsor. And then to you.And I thank you, Michel. I wanted first to thank you as the co-chair, for your articulation of the reasons for this ordinance. I would only add that last year, the perception and I want to use the word perception because I don't know what the objective facts were.Many out there on the county staff there on the MLK committee and then other mostly African-American staff from all around the county. So it appears to us that they're watering down and making the celebration only available to employees of King County.We liked it when all the middle schools in Seattle were involved, were and had kids writing essays. We liked it when at least they and other people in the community were invited to the event, and we had it at venues that were larger than what we would need if we'd only laminate things there.So and then people brought up other issues relative to the celebration. So we thought that it would be wise and helpful that we could go back and talk to the staff here in the broader community and tell them that we've kind of institutionalize having this event and keeping it as broad as we can.And I thought that was good. But I also wanted to say that I thought that the criticisms that the executive staff that have overseen this effort had received were also valid, that it seems kind of state it needs to be more creative in terms of speakers and cultural events and other kinds of speakers.We need to be more creative than just sending a letter to middle schools asking how to sponsor our contacts. We need some staff or volunteers that really work the issue of having the community involved in our countywide celebration of our Namesake's birthday because of the historical importance, but the potential political importance of having Martin Luther King andhis life and his teachings and his example available to us and carrying on and developing public policy in implementing those policies and bringing all people together and and what he called the beloved community. So that is the rationale and reason and B, behind.Then an ordinance form that we celebrate in this manner. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for the opportunity.Thank you. Councilmember Gossett, Consumer Council.Thank you, Mr. Chair. I strongly support this proposed ordinance and would like my I would like to add my name as the sponsor. And I have a question for Andrew. It might be better from me to I'm not sure.The next item on our agenda is to create the legislative branch, equity and Social Justice team, and would that automatically then be part of the Inter Branch ESG team? I'm not sure how that little word.To.You would, and automatically the members of the ESG team wouldn't automatically be part of the coordination of the MLK annual gathering. It would be some of the members can may represent the legislative branch to be part of that team, but there's no requirement in the proposed ordinance that they would be.Would that be something we could amend this to do? I would. I mean, I don't know how this all works. Maybe, Mathias, you could give some response to that.As it comes up. You are definitely open to either amending this legislation to include the ESG legislative team members or the motion that would be before you. The next item to have those members be part of the MLK Gathering Celebration Coordinating Committee.Okay, terrific. Thank you, Andrew.Hi. Good morning. In terms of the the celebration that we're doing right now for 29.Tea Partiers, would you like to give us your name? Yes.All right. Dr. Matthias, balance around the director of the Office of Equity and Social Justice. Right. So, I mean, the process that we have done is historically there has been a MLK committee that has put the celebrations together.So we went back and asked those participants of whether they wanted to continue to be part of the committee. Al Sanders from Council, for example, continues to be in that committee and a number of other from the executive branch and some of the separate like that.Agencies too are part of that. And in addition, in the spring, as I was creating the committee, I made a call into the Inter Branch team for other representatives. So we have about half of the current participants are from the previous committee and we have some new participation as well.May I continue? Sure. I think committees. So is the inner branch team informal in terms of its composition and or is it not formal?It's it's by by or the the the 2010 ordinance that we consulted about this ordinance really lays out that we should have an entire branch team that should be appointed by or represented by directors or appointees. So all department heads and agency heads appoint people to that team.Sometimes we have chiefs of staff, sometimes we have background, social justice managers. And that position for council, the regular representation is from Carmel Ennis, from central staff, and then we have from Council of regards the office, we have regular participation but also the the there's a special representative and then others can attend as well.And Carmella's an official representative.Yes. In the past it's also been Michael Reid was has been a part of it and some other central staff.I should I mean, I would think it's not Carmella who's official, but her position would hold that.Yeah, I'm not I'm not sure what what what was forwarded to me from counsel was that it was Kamala MLA who was going to be there or her position. Yes, exactly. Who's the represent.Okay. Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember Lambert. And then we'll take this item up.Thank you, Mr. Chair. Well, first of all, I think that the idea of being inclusive is really important and maybe a county wide email going out to every employee saying, are you interested? Because we don't always know people's interests or their backgrounds or what.And when I first came here, I, I tried to get on the committee and the first year I didn't get accepted. In the second year, I thought waiting, I guess accepted last year to be on it. So maybe if they knew I wrote a book about Martin Luther King, they would, you know, think that that might bea good thing for me to be on the committee. So I wrote that I'd written a book and I didn't get on the committee. And the next year I had a copy of the cover of the book to say it actually exists and I just don't get on the committee.So I think for some. People. Maybe there was a feeling that they that only certain people could be on the committee. And so it didn't feel inclusive to me when I first got here. So anyway, I think having because we don't know what people's backgrounds are, we don't know that they were friends with Martin Luther King orthey're his children, his grandchildren, or they lived next door, you know, whatever. We have no idea. And so we put it out to every Kent County employee and let them right into you. You might find a broader base of people who would really like to be involved.Thank you.Thank you. Councilmember Lambert I Vice-Chair is helping me run the committee here. Councilmember Gossett Can we ask him to put it before us as the lead sponsor and then Councilmember Cole's do you want to offer the amendment there?Okay. Councilmember Garcia, would you like to offer this legislation, this ordinance?Thank you, Mr. Chair. At this time, I accept their privilege of putting forth and recommending to the members of the committee of the hall that we adopt and move to the County Council as a whole. Proposed Ordinance 2018 0381 related to establishing an annual gathering celebration of the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.Thank you, Councilmember Gossett. Councilmember Coles.Thank you, Mr. Chair. I move adoption of amendment number one.All right, thank you. And Amendment One is the refinements articulated by Andrew earlier with respect to the findings of fact and the operative section language about inviting all in favor of Amendment one, say i ii any opposed and one carries no turning to comments on final passage and councilmember calls as initiate a cosigner sheet here.If other members would like to sign on, it's available. Just let us know.Councilmember Coles. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just I'm very supportive of this and of course I'm voting for it. But I would like to talk with Andrew and or materials about whether we could come up with an amendment, if appropriate, is addressed.Addressing what I brought up already about council, he has changed to a legislative body ESG team that we could prepare that for the full council if we go ahead.Okay. Thank you. And Councilmember Gossett and.I thank the very appropriate materials, because I think that our ESG team is different than the Martin Luther King Committee that put on this event of the separate entity. Yeah. So I think that's very wise that we do the research and figure out how they either state separate and how they work or if it's necessary or helpfulthere. I wanted to ask Jay members also on the other committee that that ought to be good. Thank you. Mr..Thank you. All right. Anything else? Want to thank Councilmember Coles and Councilman Baldacci for signing on as co-sponsors and markup when you call the roll on this item as amended.Thank you, Mr. Chair. Councilmember Bell. Duchin. Councilmember Dunn. Councilmember Carson. Hi. Councilmember Colwell. Councilmember Lambert. Councilmember McDermott.All right.Council member of the Grove. Councilmember one right there. Mr. Chair. Right, Mr. Chair, the vote is nine eyes, no no's.All right. We've given a do pass recommendation of that. Given that the legislation calls for that second week of January, why don't we expedite it? Since there may be an amendment, we won't put it on consent, but let's bring it up as soon as we can.Diaz, thank you for being here, for your work on this important celebration. And all the other work you're doing in this office is great.Thank you. And I think the upcoming celebration will not disappoint. So thank you.Very good. Thank you. We have some singing.We have some spoken word. All right. Yeah. All right. And, like some music as well. Yeah.Sounds good. Okay. Was anybody there for the pickle speech? Does anyone remember the pickle speech? Speaking of spoken word, very good. Recommend you go back on KQED and watch it. Excellent Speaker. All right. Our final item today is propose motion 2018 0282 offered by Council Chair McDermott, Councilmember Garcia and Councilmember Cole Wells.\nSummary:", "answer": "AN ORDINANCE relating to the establishment of an annual gathering celebrating the life and legacy of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; and adding a new chapter to K.C.C. Title 2."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nNine is consider requiring paid parking at any future city owned or operated parking lots, including the Main Street Ferry Terminal. This item was placed on the agenda at the request of Councilmember Vela, and we have three speakers.Okay. So, Councilmember Ballard, the floor is yours.I'll keep it short. But basically this item has come up a number of times whenever we've discussed our Climate Action Plan and various projects that have been brought before the Council. And I thought that it would be helpful to have this conversation agenda so that we can really discuss it in full.Because I know that there are a number of items coming back to the council are scheduled to come back to us and as we all know, free, there's nothing that's really free. It just means that it's subsidized from somebody.And and in in this case, subsidizing parking means that we're spending public funds on parking, which is not necessarily in line with our stated goals under our Climate Action Plan or in line with our other goals in terms of finding ways to provide more housing and things like that.So I just want us to have this conversation so that we can give staff some direction ahead of these items coming back. And I certainly I didn't I specifically didn't put a dollar amount or anything like that because obviously it depends on the project and how we go about and, you know, enforcing it.But I think if we can at least have the general conversation and perhaps give staff some general direction to put this into effect, then any time an item comes up where there would be a city lot or city parking, we know to to include this analysis in the staff report so that we can vote on it.And it just becomes part of the conversation as opposed to something that we add on later on. So I hope you'll be supportive.Okay. And so I. I think I'm. So what's your ask?My ask is that we direct staff essentially to come back to us with either what basically to give directive to staff that for any projects including city parking city. Any any parking lots or other parking structures that they provide us with options for how to actually do that had actually charge for parking and that that be partof the the cost analysis that that gets built in.Okay. For new projects. Mm hmm. Okay. And we have new public speakers on this. Are we do we have three? Okay. Any current questions from council before we take our public speakers?Calcium or maybe not from the author, but from staff. So the parking lot at Seaplane Lagoon Ferry, I mean, is that something that has already been. We've done that.It's already there. Okay.So. Okay.Anything further? Let's hear those patient public speakers Denise Trapani.Debbie Ryan and Ruth Harvey.Who they are. Good evening. It's still evening.Thank you.Hi.Hi, Madam Mayor and council members, thank you for the opportunity to speak here tonight and especially thank you, former Vice Mayor Vella, for bringing this subject up. I also want to start by thanking staff, especially the transportation and planning staff and the public work staff for the work they've done to encourage aluminum and to choose alternative transportationoptions. We heard from the public works director that said the Cross Alameda Trail, a big section of it is opening in a couple of days. It was actually open today and I got to ride it tonight. And it's amazing.It's stunning. But even with all that encouragement that our staff is doing for people to choose, alternative transportation's drivers are continuing to kill and injure people on our streets, and our greenhouse gas emissions from personal transportation continue to rise.It's clear that encouraging people to get out of their cars isn't enough. I'm here to ask you to please go beyond encouraging people to do the right thing by also actively discouraging driving. You can do that by no longer paying the cost of people to park in our public lots at the ferry and in other places.If this comes up and we have a public conversation about it, you're going to hear from people who say that you can't charge for parking at the ferry until you provide another transit option. But that's simply not true.That's no different than people saying you can't approve any more housing construction until you solve all our traffic issues. The issues are unrelated and drivers will just keep moving the goalposts. If you were able to magically get Alameda or Alameda County Transit to provide bus service to the terminal, people would still need to pay an extra 450daily for their roundtrip bus drop bus ride. I don't know why we would think that the they need the option to pay for a bus ride before we start giving away parking. We've run bus service out to Main Street terminal before while there was free parking.People didn't stop driving then and they won't do it now. Not unless the option is at least financial parity, which means we have to charge for parking. And I'd also ask you to maybe consider something a little more radical, which is potentially absolving yourselves from the responsibility to provide free parking.It's it's not our responsibility. It's not a free parking. It's not a right. It's a luxury that we've decided to give to those who are lucky enough to afford a car and choose to drive. There is no free parking, so I think my time is almost up that I'll just close with that.So thank you for raising this issue.Thank you.Debbie Ryan and Ruth Abby Ben Smith.Good. Very late evening, Tom. Yeah. Good evening. Try to keep it short. Hopefully you received a letter earlier today from Qatar. Can the action for sustain. Mm. But my name is Debbie Ryan with Qatar. And the gist of the letter is that we are in support of furthering this conversation and considering the requirement of paying for parkingas stated in the referral. Mainly because we do want to completely connect this to the transportation plan, the transportation choice plan that was committed to start a year and a half ago. The Climate Emergency Mobilization Resolution that was committed to in March of last year, as well as the Climate Action Resiliency Plan that was committed to inSeptember. We very much feel that these are directly related. And if you look at the current plan, which details on page 21 to 22 and as of January 2020, about 70% of Almeida's annual GHG emissions will come from transportation.And in order to reach the city's newly set sustainability goals, Alameda must achieve deep cuts in transportation emissions. This is directly affiliated with that. And if you look at the letter, it does detail. I don't have to go through all the bullets, but all the different ways that we really can reduce GHG, we can increase carpooling, wecan look at increasing biking to the ferry and the cross Alameda Trail and ridership on AC Transit Line 96. So all of these can be implementable and increased upon. Now, we do also look at the idea, I think, what the last speaker just said, which is that in conjunction we have to look at this by continuing themomentum, the forward innovation of affordable transportation options. Because speaking to many folks, including at a community event this evening, people want to ride their bikes, they want to lock them up. They want to ride their scooters. They want to see new lines and new pools developed.We have to keep working on that together, but we have to avoid the use of the single occupancy vehicles. Real quickly, I just wanted to also read a quick note. This is not here locally, but just a congratulations article to the towns of Banff and Canmore.Yet another city who's increased their use of paid parking in order to look at the reduction of GHG emissions. And I think there's a really good point here in that it says these proposals do not represent yet another fee, but rather paid parking redistributes a silent charge on all taxpayers to an explicit charge for those who usepublic parking lots. And I think that's really important for us to consider, because these parking spaces are worth something and the city should use perhaps the funds coming out of it to work in other ways to get people out of their cars.So thank you. We're in full support.Thank you for all your good work with Ryan Mosby.Good evening, Madam Mayor. Members of the City Council. My name is Ruth Abby with Community Action for Sustainable Alameda. And we support the the request to put this discussion on a future agenda. You're not going to be discussing the merits of the proposal tonight.But I think one of the things you might ask staff to do when you do is to look at a blanket policy rather than coming up for each new development to provide options for paid parking. Just, you know, develop a city council policy that you will always have paid parking for public spaces, and that would be ourrecommendation. Then you don't have to worry about it. You don't have to litigate it every time and have public comment and concerns about it. It would just be the policy of the city. Thank you very much.Thank you. And Mr. Smith.And good evening, Madam Mayor, Vice Mayor and council members. And thank you, Councilmember Melo, for bringing this up. I've been a member of the Sierra Club for a long time and I remember bringing up housing for a long time.All of these organizations have been saying, we, we need to do something to have people pay for parking. It's another example of inequality by subsidizing the car, not paying the full prices. And we make people pay for a bus ticket, which is environmentally better.It's also the people that take the busses generally have less money to begin with. So it's just backwards, bad public policy. So I realize that it's it's difficult to do politically, but this is where the education begins and great deal with climate change deals, inequality.We've got to begin educating people and there's no way to begin that education and with the pocketbook, but no better way to do that. So thank you. I really do support having this come up for discussion.Okay. So council your thoughts.I'll jump in.Again.Yeah. So just to finish my other point. So when the ferry station parking opens, is that going to be paid?Seaplane Lagoon.Seaplane Lagoon.Yeah. Yes.That's the intent. We are actually bringing back. And so we can take your comments tonight and we're bringing back a parking.Staff.Report, I believe, in March. So we can at this point, this is great timing. So we can take your comments from tonight and put it into that staff report.Okay. So I'll be really quick because it's getting late. I fully support this. I think we need to go even beyond what this this does. San Francisco, you know, different neighborhoods have different stickers where you're allowed to park in certain times.Where I grew up, we used to every car had a village sticker and it was kind of cool to see the different art on them. But the point is, if you didn't have a sticker, you got a ticket and you also generated some revenue.So if there was something we could do to kind of charge for parking, kind of in a way, you know, like you got to have a permit to park on a city street. I don't know what that solution looks like, but other cities have done it because I think, as the speaker said, you know, there's just waytoo many cars here and the cost of driving nice to drive to San Francisco. It would be $7 to park and $6 for roundtrip. I mean, that was $13. That's not a lot of money to go to San Francisco.But, you know, if it was 25, I'd never go because it was 40 bucks to park downtown. But, you know, if if the cost of parking is comparable or is prices you out, then, you know, you'll have to take a bus.And then last thing, this chicken and the egg thing about the funding, I think if we start charging for parking and we can amass enough money, we can help subsidize bus because I think that's what we did with the line 19.We paid for it as a city the first couple of years and then we paid more. But once it generated more revenue and then I and I also think we're having site A I think we're getting bus service on day one, too.So I mean, those kind of arguments don't really hold a lot of water with me.I will just chime in and remind us that what we already know is that we can charge for parking, we can have regulations, but it requires enforcement. And I do know I have it on good authority that in the next month or so that item is coming to us.So, you know, we want to manage expectations. It's never enough to just say, yeah, we're going to pay for parking, but there has to be a way to deal with it. And then yeah, just a reminder.Councilmember Desai One thing that I would encourage when we talk about single occupancy vehicles is this the people who drive to work are not bad people, they're not evil people. They are fellow residents, they are neighbors. They love this city just as much as anyone.And if the trend is any indication, at some point we're going to get out, get away from. You know, gas powered cars that everything will be electric. So I would encourage the residents to avoid rhetoric that paints single occupancy vehicles as bad people.And I'm very concerned that that's the trajectory that we can be going. They get up early in the morning, travel long distances like San Jose or Fremont, you know, to make a living for their families just like everyone else.And by the same token, you know, it doesn't mean that, you know, people who ride bicycles are, you know, all the virtuous people. Let's not create caricatures of different people who utilize different modes of transit. Let's just have a policy discussion on its merits.Thanks. Hi. Well, I appreciate. I think. I think that's a that's a point well taken. Um, let's see. Just going down the line. Oh, well, the maker of the motion and I.Want to clarify one thing, because I this is a I had two drafts of this and I realize this is after it got published this it. This is this wasn't the original one. And that there was this not the one that I intended to use.And it says that new including the new terminal at Main Street. And that was a typo.And it's.The seaplane lagoon, but also any any new parking or changes to the parking at Main Street. Because one of the things that has come up in the past that we've discussed is perhaps repaving or expenditures out there. And I want that to be considered as new parking if we're going to be expending any sort of major fundsto improve existing lots.Right. Basement X way.Sure. So obviously. Well, hopefully. Obviously, a topic near and dear to my heart. I guess I'm struggling a little bit with what we're actually asking because we already have policies that every public every public parking project that is underway or exists is priced except for our two ferry terminals and Main Street ferry terminal is likely going tofade into fade in its use significantly. It's very unlikely that anybody will be using it at once once the new the new terminal goes in. And I would want to be careful that we're not spent encouraging encouraging the spending of money on unpaid parking infrastructure.It's a place that people might not be using, although I think if it's going to be revamped because it's getting used, I think I think it's a it's a good idea. My understanding is that we have a parking policy for street parking, etc., that is somewhat under development.We've tried so many different things that the transportation folks I have no idea where that is and I don't have an expectation it will be to us in the next month. But. But. I guess I'm not I'm not I'm not exactly sure what direction we're giving to staff.I don't know that there is. With all the different transportation projects, whether or not something asking for somebody to come back very, very soon on this issue I don't think is going to have a huge impact. And I'm wondering if we can kind of give more direction that when issues related to city owned lights and etc. come, you know, rather than a discussion in the future, why don't we just can we just give it the the direction tonight that there always be a paid parking option?That's what I'm asking.Okay. So I heard bring it back for discussion in the future. Not tonight. So that sounded like a whole new parking item. So it's just this. Just give direction. Yeah. Okay. I do want to say one thing. The residential parking permits do not pay for themselves or barely pay for themselves.They are something like $27 a year and the state law does not allow for anything more. So all they end up doing is privatizing the street for the people who live in a specific area, but they aren't a really good management process for managing overall use.So I think we're not correcting you. There are places where they exist. We have actually given it away for free out at Harper Bay near the ferry out there. I think that's something we should maybe reconsider someday. But we're nobody parks in the street, but nobody has to pay for permits.So nobody parks anyway. But yeah, I can see if that if that's if that's the intent. I'm 100% on board.And I would just say I actually think that people will continue to use the Main Street Ferry terminal. It'll just be more trips that are going to Oakland, and that's yet another way we get single occupancy vehicles off the road.But I also think that it is a matter of prioritizing both staff time and funding. And I think that Seaplane Lagoon should be were our biggest pressures because I think that, you know, this is the new ferry terminal and you're starting from scratch from the ground up.You can do it. Right. But I think it's those are good recommendations. I just think that we also need to tell staff it's not something that you push everything else off the desk and work on this. But I think, you know, it's it is something I think.We.Do need to do whatever we can to incentivize people out of their single occupancy vehicles. But I, I hear what Councilmember de SAG is saying. I think I always like to look for as many carrots as sticks. I mean, my carrot is I'm not sitting in my vehicle surrounded by traffic, but it's probably telling people they're horriblepeople or implying that that's not your most effective strategy. But we're rather going to strive to do better. And even if you drive in TV, we don't need more cars on the road because the roads are pretty crowded and that will keep working.So so this is essentially a recommendation to staff and do we need anything further? Okay. So then thank you for bringing that to our attention, Councilmember Vella.

Members of Council Jason Morrison, senior city planner with Community Planning and Development. I'm here to present the rezoning application at 3001 South Federal Boulevard, or the property more commonly known as Loretto Heights.The request is from MPI too, which is a campus zone district to customize zoning of potentially 24 Fields 25 and Annex three with waivers. So before I begin, I do want to provide a little background on how we got here this evening.In 2018 at TCU University sold the former Loreto Heights campus, which presented a unique opportunity to build on the site's legacy through a sensitive redevelopment that incorporates the vision of the surrounding community. For over a year, CPD worked with neighborhood residents and stakeholders to capture the community vision for this area.The community driven public process builds on previous work done by local leaders and neighborhood groups who have been eager to put a plan in place for many years. This planning process included a significant outreach component, which consisted of ten steering committee meetings, four public meetings, including an all Spanish language meeting.Two online surveys, which yielded 2300 individual comments and the distribution of over 25,000 fliers. Some of the key land use recommendations that came out of the plan include preserve and reuse historic structures and features, encourage affordable housing development, promote a diverse mix of uses, and allow for a variety of building heights and intensities.There are also a number of mobility, connectivity and open space recommendations found throughout the Lorelei Heights area plan. This plan was adopted in September of 2019 and ensures that decisions such as this rezoning are done with current policy guidance in place that reflects the community's vision.70 acre subject site is in Council District two, which is Councilman Kevin Flynn's district in southwest Denver. The site is in the Harvey Park South Statistical neighborhood. And as I mentioned, the existing zoning is CPI to which is intended to be applied to smaller to medium scale educational campus sites adjacent to lower density residential districts.Maximum building heights are 150 feet, maximum and 75 feet maximum, when within 175 feet of a protected district. Surrounding zoning includes single unit, multi-unit and mixed use districts of varying heights and intensities. The Ruby Hill part you claim covers the eastern half of the subject site, and maximum height restrictions range from 55 feet to 204 feet, dependingon the topography. The proposed maximum allowable building heights that would result from this rezoning range from 35 feet to 110 feet. Silverado Heights Lawyer Plan provides additional guidance on maximum allowable building heights, which I will cover shortly. As previously mentioned, this is a former educational campus.Existing land uses include public and quasi public and mixed use. Surrounding land uses include single unit, multi-unit and commercial and retail. Additionally, the subject site is adjacent to Loreto Heights Park. The next two slides. So the existing context within and around the subject site, and these are some of the iconic buildings on the former campus.From left to right, we have Chris, a hall in the quadrangle. The administration building in the May Bond filled Stanton Library Theater. And these images are representative of some of the existing context surrounding the subject site. Examples include single unit and multi-unit structures, commercial uses and the Denver School of Science and Technology immediately south of the subjectsite. As part of one application, the applicant requests three zones a DG 24 and DG 25 for Denver Zoning Code Section 961 as well as your MCs three with a waiver to five storeys at a high level Pdg 24 would apply to the historic core of the Heights campus is based on the Denver Zoning Code District.Copyright two and addresses the preservation, adaptive reuse of the historic buildings and open spaces, along with new residential and commercial development in a campus setting. The proposed Pdg 25 allows for low scale residential development oriented toward a network of new streets and open spaces to the north and west of the historic campus.For this, Pudi has four sub areas based on a s RH 2.5 and you are x three zone districts. He proposed the Denver Zoning Code District of U.N. x three, which is urban. Mixed use for up to three stories, is intended for use in the urban neighborhood context, which is characterized by small scale, multi-unit, residential and commercialareas embedded in single unit and two unit residential areas where a building scale of three stories or 45 feet is desired. The applicant is requesting a mixed three zone district with a waiver to allow for up to five stories.And I will get into details of that request here in just a moment. In responding to the unique attributes of the subject site, new DG 24 contained several special provisions that address the design of buildings that may front open spaces or public streets.The protection and treatment of historic buildings prior to any local historic designation. The adaptive reuse of historic buildings and open spaces that may not be designated as local historic landmarks. Flexible design allowances for exterior alterations, additions, and reconstruction of these buildings.And finally, the height of buildings within a unique topography. Similarly, Dee, 25, contains several special provisions, including addressing buildings up front, open spaces and public streets, implementing land use recommendations that do not match the existing zoned district that came out of the Loreto Heights small area plan.For example three storey maximum height for rowhouse districts and a suburban neighborhood context, as well as side street standards for South Irving Street and South Julien Streets. And finally, addressing height with a unique topography, including a height incentive which rewards development meeting Denver's green building objectives.Finally, the applicant is requesting the UN through his zone district with a waiver to allow for up to five stories. This zone district is a mixed use zone district, which allows for a variety of residential, commercial and office uses.It allows the townhouse general and shopfront building forms up to three stories or 35 feet, except for the Townhouse Building Forum, which allows up to 38. The applicant is proposing a waiver and maximum building heights, which would allow it to five storeys or 70 feet.You'll find that this waiver request is consistent with the height guidance in the Loreto Heights small area plan inconsistent with CPD policy of using waivers as a bridge to future text amendments to the Denver zoning code. The CPD has identified a need for a future use by some district.In addition to this rezoning, the Loreto Heights Large Development Review Framework outlines specific regulatory steps required for implementation of the development, including completion of an infrastructure master plan, mobility study and subdivision. In addition, the framework identified potential topics for a future development agreement, including affordable housing, off site street improvements, historic preservation requirements outside of the community andopen space maintenance and track. Concurrent with this MAP amendment, the applicant is proposing to record a development agreement that would ensure a number of important provisions. The development of affordable housing units on the subject site, protection of historic buildings and campus character through local historic designations and demolition prohibition.Inclusion of publicly accessible open space and enhancements to Loreto Heights Park. Compliance with the Denver Green Code for residential structures within the residential PV or G 25 that require additional maximum building height. And finally, a number of off site improvements along Irving Street and Julian Street.Due to the applicant's request of extended vesting rights beyond what is allowed by the zoning code at the development agreement is also before Council this evening under a separate action item. The Mountain Limit application was unanimously recommended for approval by a planning board back on March seven and moved forward by committee last month.All notification requirements have been met since the staff report was published. We've received 16 letters in support of the proposed rezoning and two letters of opposition. That said, I do know that additional letters have been sent to council, including three letters of support from those in the area.As you know, there are five review criteria when analyzing the appropriateness of the request. Additionally in Denver, zoning code section 12, four, ten, nine, there are specific review criteria for the approval of all planned unit development zoned districts, and I'll walk through these shortly.But first, we'll start with the general review criteria, which is consistency with adoption plans. As you can see, there are three adopted plans applicable to this site Comprehensive Plan 2040 Blueprint Denver as well as a little rental height.Small area plan. The proposed MAP amendment is consistent with several strategies from Conference 2040, including a number of strategies in the equitable, affordable and inclusive vision element, as well as the environmentally, environmentally resilient vision element listed here and also detailed in the staff report.Looking at Blueprint Denver Blueprint Denver identifies three future neighborhood contexts for the subject site, suburban, special District and Urban. The western portion of the property proposed to be rezoning the G 25 is predominantly within the suburban neighborhood context.The proposed pad is based on the S, s, u, s, r, h and your three zone districts and the respective suburb boundaries are mapped consistent with the neighborhood context. The proposed Pdg 25 would allow compatible low scale residential uses and some residential mixed use in appropriate building form embedded in the neighborhood.Consistent with Blueprint's description of the suburban and urban neighborhood context. The central portion of the subject property proposed to be resolved to PG 24 is identified as a special districts context. These areas offer a diverse range of amenities.The proposed PDE is based on the campus zoned district and the respective sub area boundaries are consistent with the neighborhood context map. Although the former Loreto Heights campus will no longer serve a specifically designed purpose, the application notes that the preservation of existing buildings, the integration of open space and thoughtfully design infill development will help maintain andfurther promote the vision for unique campus feel. Finally, the eastern portion of the state is designated as the urban neighborhood context and blueprint. Denver and the proposed um x three with waivers map for this portion of the site adjacent to Federal Boulevard is not consistent with the urban neighborhood context map and would allow for compatible residential andcommercial development in an appropriate building for and facilitate the activation of a walkable public realm. The Future Places MAP identifies several place types for the subject site. The northern and western areas identified as high, medium residential, low, medium, residential and residential low.The PDS 25 boundary encompasses all of the high, medium, residential, low, medium, residential and residential low to high guidance and allowable building forms built into the Crescent Zone District is intended to respond to the existing single unit structures to the West in the North and provide a variety of residential uses that competitively transition to higher intensity usesthe closer you get to the campus core. The future places map shows the central portion of the subject property as part of the campus area within the district's context. Pudi 24 boundary encompasses the campus feature place type custom zoned district will offer a variety of sensitive infill development, including retail, residential and office uses, which will serve thesurrounding neighborhood consistent with the blueprint. Denver Place Type Description. Finally the northwest corner of the subject properties identified as a corridor feature place type and most of the eastern portion of the proposed rezoning along Federal Boulevard is identified as the community center place type.The proposed U.N. x three with waivers boundary encompasses the Community Center and Community Corridor feature Peyton Place type. The general purpose of this Zone district is provide a mix of residential, commercial and office uses that promote a safe, active and pedestrian scaled street edge.The Zone District is intended for corridors, embedded neighborhood business areas and larger sites. Staff finds that the proposed math amendment is consistent with the future place mapped in this area. Looking at Blueprint's growth strategy, the western portion of the subject property is located within the all other areas of the city growth area where 10% employment growth and20% housing growth is anticipated by 2040. Blueprint Denver identifies the eastern portion of the property along Federal Boulevard as a community centers and corridors growth area. These areas are expected to see 20% of new employment growth and 25% of new housing growth by 2040.The proposed MAP amendment is consistent with the growth strategy map for this area. The proposal allows for a variety of residential infill development that will support housing growth, as well as an appropriate level of mixed uses that will enable the growth of employment opportunities.An equity analysis was done for this property and the subject site is in an area with below average access to opportunity. The proposed rezoning from the Campus Zone District will enable a greater mix of residential, retail, commercial and pedestrian oriented uses within close proximity to the surrounding community.The anticipated development that will result from this rezoning has the potential to bring additional services and amenities, including publicly accessible open space that draws residents and visitors into the site from the surrounding community. Improvements to infrastructure, streetscape and existing network of local and regional trails will further improve multimodal connectivity and greater accessibility in the community.Staff finds that this rezoning application will have a positive impact on improving access to opportunity in the area. The subject's site is in an area that is more vulnerable to displacement. The proposed rezoning from the Campus Zone District will enable greater access to jobs and a diversity of residential opportunities, including both for sale and for rent inunits. The rezoning will allow for a variety of residential building forms, including middle density housing. Additionally, an affordable housing agreement has been finalized concurrent with this rezoning, and this agreement will ensure the provision of for rent and for sale affordable housing units on the subject site.These affordable units will be available to households of diverse income levels, dispersed equitably throughout the site size to accommodate a variety of households and of similar type to market rate housing units and redevelopment staff. Stop of this rezoning application will have a positive impact on this measurement and has the potential to greatly improve the vulnerable displacement scorefor this area over time. Subject site is in an area that has above average housing diversity. This area is considered not diverse for one of the indicators, and that's percent of middle density housing, and that's anywhere from 2 to 19 units.Is anticipated that the proposed rezoning from the Campus Zone District will further increase the diversity of housing options in the area, including single unit duplex. It will small scale and large scale multi-unit options such as townhomes, rowhouses.And apartment building forms.Subject site has a job mix that is similar to the city's overall mix of job types. The proposed zone districts will continue to allow various commercial office and retail jobs in the area consistent with the citywide average. Staff finds that on balance, this rezoning application will continue to have a positive impact on the area's jobs diversity.We print Denver provides additional recommendations when it comes to rezonings such as this one that include a historic preservation component as well as a customized zoning approach. The proposed G 24 would promote the preservation and adaptive reuse of the historic resources on the former Loreto Heights campus and would facilitate its continued use consistent with the recommendations wefind in Blueprint Denver. Additionally, due to the many unique attributes of the property, including the challenging topography and the variety of remaining historic resources located in the center of the site, there is no standard zoned district that can address the site's unique and extraordinary circumstances.Similarly, the Pwds and Next Three District with waivers will assist in implementing the land use recommendations from the Loreto Heights small area plan that do not match an existing zoning district. Therefore, the use of a puti and a standard district with waivers is consistent with the recommendations we find a blueprint.Denver.Next we're looking at the Loreto Heights small area plan, the neighborhood context and future place. Maps created in this plan provide detailed guidance for use in rezonings and other policy decisions. In 2019, these maps updated the same blueprint Denver Maps.As a result, you'll find consistency in staff's analysis in this section with the future place and context maps previously discussed. Consistent with the blueprint Denver Mapping and analysis, there are three different future neighborhood contexts for the subject property and that suburban special district and urban.The proposed PD 25 would allow complex compatible residential uses and some residential mixed use in an appropriate building form embedded in the neighborhood consistent with the lower Hyde smaller airplane. Description of the suburban and urban neighborhood context. Similarly, the proposed Pdg 24 is appropriate and consistent with the Special District's context plan direction, as it will allow forthe preservation and adaptive reuse of historic buildings and new residential and commercial development in a campus setting. Finally, the proposed U.N. actually with waivers, would allow for compatible residential and commercial development in an appropriate building for the facilitate activation of a walkable public realm, which is consistent with the urban context description.Consistent with the blueprint. Denver Mapping and analysis. The Future Places map identifies several place types for the subject site. Pdg 25 allows for low scale and medium scale residential development oriented toward a network of new streets and open spaces.Pdg 24 addresses the historic core of the former rights campus with the preservation and adaptive reuse of historic buildings and the customized zoned district will allow for a variety of sensitive infill development, including commercial, residential and office uses, which will serve the surrounding neighborhood consistent with a low rate small area plan.Place. Type. Description. The proposed U.N. makes three waivers, provides a mix of residential, commercial and office, uses that promote a safe, active and pedestrian skilled street edge. The Zone District is intended for corridors like Federal Boulevard, embedded better neighborhood business areas and larger sites like the former Loreto Heights campus.The carefully calibrated high guidance in the P g 25, which allows for a maximum of two and a half to three stories in allowable building forms into the Customs Zone. District is intended to respond to the existing single unit structures to the north and the west of the site and provide a variety of residential uses that competitivelytransitions to higher intensity uses the closer you get to the campus core. The proposed maximum allowable building height 5 to 8 storeys and the ADG 24 in the mass and scale of building varies as appropriate when considering the historic status of the site.Du G, 24, contains massing footprint and spacing requirements and restricts the number of placement of any building over five storeys on the site to a single location. Finally, the Loreto Heights area plan recommends a five storey maximum height on the eastern portion of the site in the unmixed three zone district.The waiver to five stories helps to improve the transition between commercial development and adjacent residential neighborhoods like the College View Neighborhood to the east. The proposed rezoning will result in uniform application of zoned district building form, use and design regulations.It will also further the public health, safety and welfare by implementing adopted plans, as well as providing enhanced design standards, a broader mix of uses and mobility improvements as well as much needed affordable housing. And the application identifies change or changing conditions as justifying circumstance with the newly adopted plan guidance in the recently adopted the red lightsmall area plan. The requested Pdg 24, pdg 25 and you three with waivers is consistent with the neighborhood context, description, zoned district purpose and intent, which I won't get into right now. In addition to the general review criteria, Denver's zoning code Section 12 four nine contains additional review criteria for the approval of all planned unit development zonedistricts. Staff finds that the proposed districts are intended to respond to unique and extraordinary circumstances where more flexible zoning than what is achieved through a standard zone district is desirable on and multiple variances, waivers and conditions to be avoided.One example of a unique and extraordinary circumstance to preview 25 is where a development site has specific, special physical characteristics, including lots with significant topography. There is a significant amount of topography on the western portion of the redevelopment site, and the site cannot be redeveloped under the existing zoning or any standard zoned district without significant waivers andconditions, while also addressing buildings that front desired open spaces. Specifically, there is approximately 133 feet of fall on the western portion of PGE 25, which equates to about a 9% average grade. And there are areas within the party where the grade is upwards of 11%.Additionally, within the western portion of the site, there are a number of unique existing conditions, including a 100 foot wide Denver water easement, an existing irrigation ditch to be preserved, and a cemetery also to be preserved to the northwest of the site.As previously stated, Pdg 25 will further implement land use recommendations that do not match an existing Denver zoning code zone district. Similarly, one example of unique and extraordinary circumstance applicable to PD 24 is where a customized zoning approach is necessary to protect and preserve the character of a historic structure or historic district.Pdg 24 will enable standards to protect historic buildings prior to any local historic designation and by supporting the adaptive reuse of historic buildings in open spaces that are not expected to be formally designated. With flexible design allowances for exterior alterations, additions and new construction.According to section 9.6.1.1. D in the Denver zoning code. In return for the flexibility in site design, a district should provide significant public benefit. Staff finds that the districts are compatible with the goals and objectives of current plan for providing significant public benefits, including the provision of a diverse range of affordable housing options, including different price pointstypes, and a mix of rental and for sale units. Provision of publicly accessible open space and valuable connections to the adjacent Liberto Heights Park and Regional Trail Network, including the Platte River Trail, development patterns compatible in character and design with surrounding neighborhoods while preserving the historic structures and character of the former Loreto Heights campus.Expanded allowed uses on the former campus while providing a storage structure is more flexibility to adapt to new uses over time. And finally, investments in public infrastructure, including public roads which improve East-West vehicular and pedestrian connections throughout the subject site.The remaining criteria are listed here on your screen. The first criteria is that the districts comply with all applicable standards and criteria. As stated in Division 9.6, staff finds the proposed districts comply with the standards and criteria stated in Division 9.6 next that the development proposed on a subject property is not feasible under any other zone districtsand will require a reasonable number of variances, waivers and conditions. As previously described, the site would require several variances or waivers to the standard. As you are age, you are X and copy two zone districts to accommodate the development, most notably the location, side streets, standards, height and scale of the allowed development in Pdg 25 and theflexible building standards needed to preserve and maintain existing buildings, including G 24. There is no other zoned district which would accommodate the development without variances or waivers. Next, the district establishes permitted uses that are compatible with existing land uses adjacent to the subject property.Stock lines of the district proposes uses consistent with those allowed in the SS. You are age, you are X and C empty zone districts with additions and modifications described previously. These uses are appropriate to apply to a site currently used for public and quasi public uses in a suburban neighborhood and are surrounded by varying residential intensities andcommercial areas. Finally, the beauty district establishes permitted building forms that are compatible with adjacent existing building forms, or which are made compatible through appropriate transitions at the boundaries of the districts.

Our next speaker is Annie Bensky.Hi, I'm Annie Levinsky, executive director of historic Denver at 1420 Ogden Street. We participated in the Small Area Plan Steering Committee and have remained.Engaged in the project.Planning and committee discussions over the last few years. And throughout the process, both the community meetings and the steering committee meetings.Participants and stakeholders have.Emphasized to prioritize the preservation of the unique assets and qualities of the campus. And certainly Loretto Heights is the most significant historic site in southwest Denver. And it's notable not just for its architecture, for its special cultural and historical associations, including its.Association with women's.History, something that we think is.Particularly special.As an organization. We've remained committed to the role that we can play in the preservation of the site as a partner. And we appreciate the care that has been placed in the on the rezoning and the use of the zoning that recognizes the unique attributes in this place.The specific role historic Denver agreed to play back in 2019. And what I'm happy to answer questions about this evening is to hold a perpetual preservation easement on the main administration building and chapel. This was conveyed as part of the small area plan adoption and included in the development agreement.A preservation easements are a long established tool that protect buildings through legal agreement according to preservation values. We have been in a qualified is not holder for nearly 50 years helping to protect 69 iconic properties across the metro area.Using this particular tool, we have been working to negotiate this easements and have experienced some delays during the pandemic and as West Side worked out other aspects of the development plans, it has been our understanding and goal that the easement agreement would be.Executed.Along with the development agreement. However, we have not fully resolved all the aspects of the easement agreement. Despite numerous conversations and some drafts. Even up to this afternoon. It's important that the easement provide the level of protection worthy of this building and this property and promise to the community and be an agreement that's consistent with the standards. Of our organization.And best easement practices. So we remain fully committed to getting the agreement done, and we'll continue to work on it in good faith. And I'm available to answer questions about that if needed. Thank you.All right.Thank you. Our next speaker is Eric Browning.Good evening, Eric Browning. I'm the acting building official for Community Planning and Development, and I'm here to answer questions.All right. Thank you. Our next speaker is Sochi guy Tom. And you might need to hear me. Oh, there you go. Yeah, go ahead, please.Yes. Hi. So Itchy Gaitan, a.19 year homeowner in Harvey Park, the first woman of color president of the Harvey Park Community Organization.Also known as Hip Girl.I'm no longer president. I'm now co-chair of the Colorado Latino Forum.I spoke to you.About two years ago, the typical president to share.That my board had voted to oppose the lowering.Of Heights area plan and the metro district plan. Also to share with you then several concerns that had come out of our research and conversations. So I speak to you today to ask you to vote no on the zoning change request.The Denver City Council. As you all continue with your renewed commitment to racial and social justice, I ask that you help our bipoc communities in Southwest Denver by helping to stave off some of the major gentrification sweeps that are taking place now, which will also be the outcome by approving this zoning change request.And in your commitment to racial and social justice, it only makes sense.To work.Towards dismantling racist, social, structural systems such as these types of zoning requests from major developer developers like West Side Investment.Partners. I also ask you to question the consequences of approving this zoning change request.I support smart growth and.Development when.It's done via the lens.Of equity.And social justice, which is very.Different than overdevelopment. And so.What I've seen and experienced.And is a proven fact now that under the current mayor's administration.The city of Denver is the second.Most gentrified city in the nation.Displacing vulnerable communities such as my bipoc community, also low.Income white families.And what is proven fact is how much dark.Money has been.Poured into campaigns of current politicians.By many developers.That do the work in this city, including West.Side. Another fact is that West Side sits on the board of over 17 metro districts holding power and complete control over the districts.And the property.Taxes of the homes and.Businesses within the boundaries. And they reinvest the bonds from their benefit for their benefit.And on the backs of working families.So as you approve this request, it opens the floodgates.And to.A wide range of liberties. And so I ask you to think about.The following one. It gives them legally enforceable.Agreement with a guarantee for the developer site plan.That does not include community.Concerns to total 20 years of vesting rights for the.Developer as opposed to a.Typical five years. Three. No guarantees that the developer will address traffic concerns in and around the campus.Thank you for your public comment this evening. Our next speaker is Donna Rapp.Good evening. I'm Donna Reed. 4830 West Colorado Avenue. I'm a representative of the South Mali, at which you're in Park Reno. And I served as my neighborhood's backup on the official Loretta Hyde steering committee. My neighborhood unanimously voted.To approve the.Small area plan, which was developed in partnership with the community. And we continue to support this project. I can't stress enough how much from then to now this developer.Has involved the community in the visionary process.It's undeniable that Loreto Heights is a gem, truly a landmark. So when the sale of the 72 acres happened, it created a sense of doubt.In the community about what would happen next.At the time of the sale, the current zoning allowed for heights of up to 15 storeys. So the creation of an inclusive steering.Committee meant that any future development would have to wait.At the very least a whole year until the community could properly weigh in. So that was encouraging news to the community because the pause button was pushed by none other than the developer. In sure. West Side.Listen to the community.This is actually a down zone in each. R.A. appointed their own representatives to serve their neighborhoods on the committee and in the end to gather. We came up with an area plan reflective of that year long, inclusive process.Communication flowed freely to and from West Side, Denver staff and the community. And the process has always been one in which the developer actively created a space for the community to weigh in. I've never been allowed to wander freely onto Loretto Heights because it's been private property.So for the first time ever, Loreto Heights will be accessible to all people to enjoy. Remember, the vision of the steering committee has always been for Loreto Heights to have a village like feel keeping the wonderful spirit of Loreto in its character.We asked for affordable housing with a mix of other price points available. Very little traffic pedestrian and cyclist friendly. A sustainable place that fosters inclusion. This is what the community wants and is asking for. So when the developer announced that Pan Croatia Hall would be used for affordable housing.I thought, he gets it. It was a perfect first move based on the community driven process. My neighborhood association is in full support of this proposed.Rezoning.And personally I support it too. Please approve the rezoning request. So the legacy of Loreto Heights can continue to impact the Southwest Denver community in positive ways. Loreto Heights needs new life and love breathed back into this wonderful place.Thanks so much for your time and consideration and I'll stick around in case you have any other quick questions for me. Thank you.Thank you, Donna. Our next speaker is Tess Dougherty.Hi there. I want to once again. Go ahead. Okay. Okay. I just wanted to you ask that when.Decisions like this are being made, that the city council is is keeping in mind equity is keeping in mind that this that the. But decisions have not always been made, and I would argue maybe in most cases have not been made with with the with the culture of the neighborhood and and people who are most marginalized inlife. And so I just, you know, I feel like a lot of these zoning decisions that I sit through and that we here are just not centering the people who have been silenced for the longest. And so I also I don't think that depending on Arnaud's as the only voice in the city for public input is isappropriate. We know that Arnaud's do not represent equitably the neighborhoods. They just don't. So I just would ask that you keep that in mind because there are so many decisions that are being made that are not centering people, people of color, low income people.They're not centering people who, you know, with disabilities. So I just it's I, I just am kind of really frustrated by some of the conversations that are not asking the right people the right questions. Thank you.Thank you, Tess. Our next speaker is Brad Billingsley.I may. Can you hear me?Mm hmm. Go ahead.Thank you. Brad Billingsley. 3940. East Wesley Avenue. Denver. 802. No. And I just want to speak to the character of West Side Development as a leader in our community. I volunteer with Food for Thought, which is a local nonprofit that addresses childhood food insecurity.We were started by local businessman Bob Bell nine years ago when he realized that many kids in Denver public schools don't have food to eat from Friday, hot lunch told the following Monday morning free breakfast at school. So back then, we started attacking stacks of foods for every student in two schools.Today we're delivering to 75 schools that are 90% or better free and reduced lunch. Many of those are in the immediate area around Loretto Heights, including College View, August Gottesman and Schmitt Elementaries. Our organization approached West Side Development two years ago with a need to create a new food packing site.We asked if we could use one of the buildings that's on Loreto Heights once they learned about what we do. They said not only yes and gave us a place to operate out of, but they also volunteered to pack food and even went so far as to buy us a forklift to help move the many pallets offood so we could feed even more kids and expand the program. Websites been critical to our ability to serve 8500 families around Denver every week, many in the Laredo Heights neighborhood. They've just demonstrated their commitment to our community quietly and consistently.They're an organization built of character that is walking the walk to help give Loreto Heights a future we can all be proud of. We've reviewed what they're asking for in terms of this development. Encourage City Council to approve the rezoning of this campus.Thank you.Thank you. Our next speaker this evening is Mark. With kids. With kids. I'm sorry, Mark. I'm going to let you go ahead and pronounce your last name. Go ahead.Thank you. Madam President, members of the City Council. My name is Mark White Cabbage. I am speaking as the applicant tonight. Here I am, a principal at West Side Investment Partners. Our address is 4100 East Mississippi Avenue, Glendale 80246.Our goal, Loreto Heights, was to seek to understand together as a community. As a community, we have come together to plan the next great chapter at Loretta Heights. We are very proud as to what we have accomplished together.Preservation, housing of all types. Open spaces. Community spaces, significant down zoning at the community's request. Just to name a few. We look forward to the next great chapter of Loretta Heights. And we thank you. And I'm happy to answer any questions, which I'll begin with one tonight that I heard earlier to address the comments from historic Denver. We are fully committed to finalizing the negotiations of the easement, as we have promised before. For further clarity, the property is protected. Even without the easement, it's not to say that we won't have a final easement, but the property is protected with an existing covenant for non demolition.There is very specific language with the side of the Peabody and there's also the development agreement. We do understand the importance of the conservation easement that the community and historic Denver has asked for and we are a stone's throw away from having that finalized.Again, I appreciate your time tonight, and I am here to answer any questions that you may have. Thank you.All right. Thank you, Mark. Our next speaker this evening is David Hagan. Go ahead, David. All right. Well, we'll see if we can get David to unmute here. All right. We'll go ahead and move to our next speaker and try to get him back in the queue.Claire Harris. Go ahead, please. You're going to have to go ahead and unmute yourself.All right. Here you go. Can you hear me now?Mm hmm.Go ahead and hear me now.So if you have a second device.All of you.Turn it down.I'm Claire here, so I live it. How do I look? You hear me? Hello?Mm hmm. Go ahead.Can you hear me? Yeah. Okay. I live.At 2695 West Dartmouth Avenue.In college view. And partly because of my location.I'm very invested in this project.I live about two or three blocks to the east of. Of Lorena Heights and.Students who went.To heights when it became a Japanese university. So I've watched it for many years, since 1970s. I've lived in the.All the good work at West Side is.Done with the neighborhoods. I've especially appreciated that the West Side has worked with all the neighborhoods and as Donna said in much detail. They've addressed our concerns. They planned to neighborhood meetings. They talked about maintaining the buildings. It's in the neighborhood, especially college views.Since it's actually part of our name, we're very invested in the continuation of some kind of youth. Have also.Been.One of the earlier speakers mentioned affordable.Housing and in my neighborhood college.You that's what it is affordable housing. Although I have to say that gentrification is a big issue all over town because even College View is now has million dollar homes. Another issue that they've addressed is the traffic on Dartmouth Avenue.Even Dartmouth matters to me.Personally as well as.Being part of the neighborhood. So I have to say that that west west side has been listened to. Concerns from the neighborhood addressed things that they could work very.Well in trying.To maintain what they. After that of the surrounding areas.And we appreciate that greatly in college.You. Thank you.Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Jim Gibson. I'm going to get Jim Gibson up into the queue here. All right. Go ahead, please.Okay. Thank you. Good evening. My name is Jim Gibson. I live at two seven, eight, seven South Stuart Street, board member of the Hardy Park Community Organization, otherwise known as hip hop. My involvement with the redevelopment of the Arts campus began in 2016.I led an effort to conduct a series of community conversations in 2017 that resulted in the document community recommendations, which were shared with West Side Investment Partners shortly after it was announced the company had bought the property. I also served on the steering committee of the city sponsored Laredo Heights area plan and as a result, the HipHop Board asked me to serve as chair of the Liberal Arts Subcommittee and represent hip cause position this evening. The Harvey Park Community Organization and the community we represent are largely in favor of the rezoning of the liberal arts campus.We will support the rezoning of this project with the commitment of the City and Western investment partners to address the following two major concerns over the course of the project. We look forward to working with the city and the developer on these items.Major concern. Number one, we're concerned about the effects of gentrification and displacement in our community. We recommend that the city and all developers take into consideration anti displacement measures such as rent subsidies, a city living wage, utilizing a localized area, median income and increased services and supports.For example, we recognize that the aim for affordable housing units is set at the regional rate of $100,000 for a family of four. Our concern is that the amount immediately surrounding the Loreto Heights campus is roughly $63,000. Therefore, we recommend to the city and county of Denver and the West Side investment partners that the AMA should bebased on a more localized geographic area rather than the Denver metro area in this development and in all future developments. Major concern. Number two, a community services center should be formally included on the campus to provide essential community services to the local area related and unrelated to the redevelopment.Some additional concerns. The redevelopment should have a maximum five storey building height net zero carbon emission goals should be put in place for the redevelopment. An ordinance and or a new provision in the development agreement should be approved by Denver City Council to ensure that Dartmouth Avenue remains closed and roadways should have four way stops.At a date certain. A raised federal boulevard meeting in front of the campus should be constructed to maximize pedestrian safety, and a three legged car should be covered by the developer. The Federal Boulevard traffic signal should stay in Amherst, not move to Bates.If the signal is moved, the developer should pay the cost. City Council should require that adequate time be provided for community review of the finalized traffic impact study before the rezoning request is approved. And we also finally, we recommend that the city's process for community involvement in future developments undergo rigorous capacity building around diversity, equity, justice andinclusion. Thank you for your time and I'm available.Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker, we're going to go back to David Hagan and see if we can get him in the queue.Hello? You hear me?Go ahead, David.Sorry, my phone died and I'm not at anymore.I really appreciate the gentleman that just spoke. Unfortunately, I don't think our city work that way. If we let them pass this right now, none of your concerns will be met and need to be changed. The lady that spoke earlier about her fellow bipoc folks I think is pretty much spot on.When I hear the city talk about. Affordable housing or mixed income housing. It really scares me when they don't start telling me how many. What is it? What does affordable housing mean? Because from.What I can understand or what I gather in the city of 80% AMI is.Affordable housing.Well, 80% AMI $100,000. I mean, it doesn't get any done. No, that doesn't just look like if you read that book. I mean, there's people that are going to folks that are going to need 20 and 30%. Amy, we're not going to displace people.And I don't know why, but the city continues never, ever provide that or when they do it, very limited. Um, I think that we need that just in general. There needs to be a little bit more transparency. Well, I mean, a lot more transparency of what the city's got going on when it comes to stuff like this. Um, just telling us that affordable housing doesn't really.It basically.Means there's not any affordable housing because if.You are going to have affordable housing, it's bragging about how good a job you doing. So when zoning comes in is that that we know they're pushing it and they need to take it back to the drawing board and come back, give us something and.Refrain from any profane language.David Oh, I'm sorry. The city's been firing me up lately.And for you to. Not out of anything but passion. So I wish some of the people on this council cared about as much about the city as I do. That's all I got. Thank you.Thank you. Our next speaker is Martha Kirkpatrick. Go ahead, Martha. You're going to have to admit. There you go.Go ahead. Sorry. Thank you, counsel. My name is Martha Newland Kirkpatrick. I'm a 1982 graduate.Of Lawrence Heights College, where I received my Bachelor of Arts degree. I grew up in southwest Denver.The Harvey Park in the Bear Valley.Neighborhoods, and I currently live in Inglewood. So Lorena Heights has been part of my life for my entire life. Through community and alumni groups.Particularly, that were at a high community initiative.I became very involved about what the future health.Of his property.When Westside purchased the property in July 2018, West Side welcome the small area plan process and also took to heart the.LHC EIS recommendations to help inform and dove deeply into what the community wanted and needed.Through community meetings held on the campus.Property. Dozens of meetings.With R.A. groups from the surrounding neighborhoods.A year's worth of meetings through the small area plan process.The development team has joined hands with.All of us to craft a vision for the future of Arad.Heights. While most of us understand that not.Everyone will get everything that they want, most of us will get something that we do. And what the.Larger community wants.Is a gathering place somewhere to.Find respite and a good meal, a street.Fair, lush greenspace, an outdoor concert or a.Comfortable home. The words that come to mind, come to mind our respect.Reverence, reuse, reclaim, and the other key word that many don't wish to utter redevelopment. However, this redevelopment is being done in a different way.By respecting the wishes of the community that they will be using.And living nearby by revering the past.And letting it inform the future, by reusing.And reclaiming what was once grand and bringing it.Back to a full, colorful.And vibrant life. There are some that.Would have you believe that more time or a different plan or another developer.Might be the best strategy. But the campus has become a ghost and a shell.Quietly crumbling and fading away. It will never be what it once was. That time has passed. Let it be rewarded for waiting. Let it be rewarded with voices and laughter, life and a new legacy. Dedication to the processes and the requests for a rezoning.Exemplified by.A significant down zoning from approximately a 12 million square foot allowance to approximately a 2 million square foot development shows.That West Side Investment Partners has a vision for the future with the desires of the Southwest Denver community.Firmly in mind. I completely support West Side Investment Partners and the request for rezoning of the Loreto Heights campus property. Thank you, Counsel. I appreciate your time.Thank you, Martha. Our next speaker this evening is Sister Mary Nell Gage. Oh, there you go.Good evening.Thank you. My name is Mary Nell Gage. I am a 1966 graduate of Loretto Heights College, and I am a sister of Loreto for over 50 years. I endorse, I affirm the.Application for.Rezoning.Of the.Loreto Heights campus. I have been blessed during the last four years with engaging with neighbors and residents of Southwest Denver alumni and civic stakeholders, historical preservationists.Denver city officials.And West Side investment partners in.Discussions and.Conversations.Regarding the redevelopment.Of Loreto Heights. It has been both instructional and inspirational to be involved in such a process. I applaud the encouragement extended to those most affected by the redevelopment. To be involved in the process. I am.Grateful for that experience.Going forward. I know we will ensure both historical preservation as well as creating what.Will be needed for the benefit of our city. Honoring what has been created.By man and woman on the campus has been.One of the ideals in the respectful redevelopment.Plans.Equally important.Is enhancing the environment so that God's beautiful creation may continue to.Inspire all who are seeking.Home opportunities. To work. To learn. To play.To pray. That which has characterized Loretta Hyde since 1888.The cemetery.Where 62.Pioneer Sisters are buried.Is on the grounds. And we.Will continue to be in conversation.With Westside.Regarding the insurance.That that.Space will always be held sacred. I am confident that the motto engraved in stone.Above the academy.Building three days mores cultura will be promoted so that all who come.Will.Share the ideals of faith.Morals and culture. May the light from the.Tower.Give guidance to all who come. Thank you.Thank you. Our next speaker this evening is Guadalupe Floyd.Hi. Hi. Go ahead. Good evening. City council members. And hello. My name is Guadalupe Lloyd. I live at 3260. West Amherst. Denver 80236. And I share the northwest backyard with the Loretto Heights campus right behind me here. I am a native of Chicago, but have been visiting this campus and neighborhood for over 30 years.Since 1988, when my sister and her husband moved to their home on the west side of the campus on Irving Street. My mom and dad followed in 2000. And this is where I now live. My family was the primary reason that I.I first started coming to Denver, Colorado Heights campus and the neighborhood have made me living here. My home. Sorry, I have to read this. I don't remember everything. I have invested countless hours and energy to make sure that this campus both reflects and honors our neighborhoods, our neighborhood.Along with spending the last three years working on the redevelopment of the former.The Retro Heights campus.I am impressed with the collaboration that has taken place between the neighbors, the city and the developer. As a neighbor who will continue to share a fence with the proposed development, these rezoning applications have my full support. Since the beginning of this small area plan, I have been an active stakeholder throughout the entire process.I have been to most of the community meal meetings held on a monthly basis.As well as.Meetings in my R.A.. I understand the vision of the campus, the rezonings that will bring it to life, and the concept plans for Redevelop for Development. I love this neighborhood and my ranch house right next door here on the north side of the campus.And I am sure there are parts of me that wanted the campus to remain. But these changes are wonderful and will bring community amenities along with housing for all, and will honor the tradition of the Sisters of Loreto and the campus.Please join me in supporting the proposed rezoning rezoning applications. Finally, I believe that great collaboration has been shown by all parties. We as a community are proposing a medium density village like development that will be a treasure for our neighborhood and all southwest Denver.I thank you for your consideration. Thank you.Thank you. Our next speaker is Mark Upshaw.Can you.Hear me? Yes, go ahead, please.Madam President and members of city council. My name is Mark Upshaw. I live about 400 feet west of the campus on West Dartmouth Avenue. I live in the Dartmouth Heights neighborhood, a homeowners association of 72 homes. We share the western boundary of a lot of heights defined by South Irving Street and South Julien Way.I am co-chair of the Dartmouth High School Liaison Committee for Loreto Heights Campus Development. Tonight, I am speaking on behalf of the Dartmouth Heights neighborhood. We support the plan and urge City Council to adopt this on request. Our comments tonight are a brief summary of our position statement dated May six, 2021.It is in your information packet. The Zombies for you are a rational and natural outgrowth of the Florida Heights area plan. The small area plan was a public process managed by the Denver Community Planning Development Office. It was adopted with widespread community support by City Council in the fall of 2019.West Side Development Partners on their own initiative and under the leadership of Marc Rich, principal and project manager, has continued community engagement by holding regularly scheduled community meetings via Zoom during the infrastructure masterplan process. West Side has listened to our concerns, sought to fully understand them and incorporate them as appropriate into the development designs throughout the process. We are also.Pleased.That they have.Donated 300,000.To the city for improvements to the right of heights. Or out of Hyde Park, that is Loretta Hyde Park is located immediately north of our neighborhood. However, we continue to be concerned about the traffic impacts to our neighborhood, especially the real possibility of cuts through traffic that would use our neighborhood streets as conduits.For this reason, we strongly encourage the incorporation of calming devices on the campus to slow and discourage cut through traffic. We solicit your cooperation in expressing this concern to the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure, the mayor's office, and other appropriate city agencies.Also, we solicit cooperation from city and elected officials that there be an ongoing monitoring of traffic volumes in our neighborhood in appropriate intervals. As the campus construction progresses, such moderating will determine your traffic calming and management features are needed around the new development, and particularly in our neighborhood.We thank you for listening to our comments. We have hopes for a truly livable community that will make Southwest, Denver and the city at large proud. Thank you.Thank you. Our next speaker this evening is Lydia Pena. Go ahead, please. Oh, let me see. You've got to get you to unmute again. There you go.Thank you very much. City Council Members. I'm Lydia Pena, a sister of Loreto. Loreto Heights College was my home for 27 years, four years as a student and 23 years as the sister of Laredo faculty member on the campus.Matchup of Hall was opened with the first Christmas banquet in 1951 when I was a freshman. The view of the mountains from that dining room nurtured my soul for many years. The plan, put forth by West Side remodels match for use by the community that will be created on those grounds.It lends to the exceptional beauty of the property itself. Mark the cabbage. From West Side investment has been so respectful of the values brought to that land. My sister in Croatia, Boniface, and the first sisters of Loreto in 1888 when they purchased the property.For some three years.Mark and his team have invited the wider community of interested persons to meetings where they listened to a variety of individuals. Because of those meetings, they generated an amazing, sustainable plan with open space and affordable housing with reduced density.The Great Land will have helped bring the community together. Mark and Justine spoke. And I saw evidence of the values of those sisters who began living and working there 130 years ago. We human beings all have impressions, opinions, and it is easy to assume that what I think is fact.I have accumulated many years and as I've done that, I learned the importance of checking the evidence, the truths, the facts with. I listened to opinions and in my opinion, check what they heard the wider community saying and embedded and into a plan that respects the values of us.Sisters of Loreto. And I, as a student and sister of Loreto, wholeheartedly support.So I end by saying for all what has been thanks.And to all that will be. Yes. Thank you very much for your time and your skills.Thank you. Our next speaker this evening is Jean Myers.Hello.Good evening, counsel, and thank you.For hearing us today. It's been an amazing journey to work on this project with West Side. I'm the CEO of Thrive Home Builders. We're one of the builders in the project. We're located at 1875 Ward Street in Denver.The collaboration has been with West Side, our neighbors, the Sisters of Loreto and your staff, and a special thanks to Councilman Kevin Flynn for his tireless advocacy on behalf of the people district. To Thrive has three legs to this brand of efficient, healthy and local.We're based in downtown and homegrown. We understand Denver home buyers and what they want. For example, we build our homes with Colorado Beetle Kill Lumber. When we drive to the mountains, it's alarming to see the dead forests and anything good from that could come from that.Well, yes, we can build our homes with trees that have already died, reducing wildfire fuels and helping restore watersheds our customers love there. We specialize in healthy homes by building to the standards of EPA's Indoor Air Plus program.When we started in 2013, not many people connected the dots between health and the home. But in the last year, our customers have seen start clarity that home is where the health is. In 2019, we were indoor air plus builder of the Year nationally, and in 2020 we received EPA's Leader Award.We have homes in Central Park with full house separate filtration that can filter out the coronavirus. And and that provide real time indoor air quality monitoring. Finally, we build very energy efficient homes. In fact, based on evaluations of about.300,000.Energy efficient homes built in 2024, I was recently named the most energy efficient builder in America. In addition, the US and Canada have a friendly rivalry each year and in 2023 have also won the cross-border challenge making thrive the most energy efficient builder on the North American continent.Also in 2020.We closed our last affordable townhomes that we constructed.Under the old Stapleton Affordable Housing Program. In this last project, we built homes for 271 families at 80% of AMI or less. I'm bringing all this up to let you know that you're bringing all of these attributes and all of our expertize to Loreto Heights, West Side, New that the city of Denver and.Loreto Heights deserve the best homes in America. And that's what.We are committed to building. We will build a wide range of price points in Loreto Heights for each and every home, regardless of price will be designed, built and field tested to ensure compliance with EPA, indoor air plus EOG Zero, Energy Ready and LEED certified.We ask that you give us the opportunity.To thank you team.By improving the.Time you have this evening. Our next speaker is Ali Laubach.Hi. Good evening and thank you, council members.My name is.Ellie Lowe back and I am speaking tonight on behalf of Grand Peak's.Properties.Grand Peaks Properties is also a homegrown company.We are based in Denver and our.Founders have been building here in Colorado for over 70 years. I have personally been working with Mark Djokovic and the West Side development team for over two years on the planning and zoning efforts.Here at Loreto Heights.And our organization would be the one responsible for the creation of for rent housing. And this evening, I would like to encourage you to support this rezoning request for the following reasons. First.The entire team has ensured that any of the.Zoning proposals that we've put together are consistent with the.Approved small area.Plan as the basis of community design. Furthermore, the.Applicant.Website development has done an extraordinary.Amount of community outreach and public engagement. We've been meeting with the neighborhood now for over 18.Months.And working closely with.The Sisters of Loretto as.Well throughout this process. The rezoning proposed reflects the input and lessons that we've learned from the community throughout those years.We've also engaged a comprehensive team of experts in planning and design to thoroughly understand the entire campus and the surroundings.And advise on where appropriate density should be developed. The rezoning proposal creates certainty around outcomes. It's sensitive to and.Respects the adjacent communities and the neighborhood.Context.Surrounding it. I fully believe that the rezoning that we are proposing would enable the renovation and re-use of the just.The designated historic structures on the campus.While also creating the opportunity for new neighborhood.Centered.Uses. The mix of uses and housing.Types that we are proposing would.Establish a desirable.Balance for a fully.Supported neighborhood, and that would carry into the future. So for all of the above, these are the reasons I would.Advise that Denver City Council approves a rezoning request.Thank you so much for your time tonight.Thank you. Our next speaker is Megan Beecher.Good evening. I'm Megan Becker. I'm with McGinty Becker in Denver. I represent the Loretto Heights Metropolitan Districts Mass General Counsel, and I'm here tonight to answer any questions that may arise.All right. Wonderful. Thank you. Next up is J.J. Newman. Go ahead, please.Hello? Can you hear me okay? Mm hmm.Mm hmm.Okay.Awesome.Hi, everybody. My name is John Joseph Nieman, 2786 South Wall Street, Denver, Colorado. 802 36 A good agreement is one that stands the test of time, and I would say that we now need to add that a good agreement stands the test of code with the the community involvement and outreach efforts for this property.It was comprehensive for the Lauretta Heights small area plan creation. It contained input from neighbors that belong to many affected neighborhoods around the campus. It contained experts and novice members of our community. This down zoning is good for the community and for meeting the intention of the small area plan.Meeting I. The meetings I attended showed that this developer is taking an inclusive and deliberate approach that will maximize the value of the Denver gains through its redevelopment. There are many community and government inputs that have made this plan better, and we should never let the desire of perfection be the enemy of doing good.But this plan is good and the process that has been undertaken is great. I think having multiple zoning districts allows for residential representation in your district is the correct district for the reasons mentioned earlier. Also, the New Plains will be maintained for the surrounding area with the New Zone District six, which I think is important.It also allows for the save our theater effort for the Avon Boundaries Center to continue and still be possible, which is a really big positive for the neighborhood and for the development. Yeah, certainly this plan is not perfect.Certainly we're going to see more stipulations maybe around energy efficiency and improvements of water quality, but that may just be a discussion for another time that we can address some of the more detailed pieces. I think for myself, like so many people who live in southwest Denver, I've been working on a full time job trying to keepmy family safe from COVID over the last year. And so maybe we all haven't been as active as we used to be, but the training, the effort that we invested in, we wanted to see that small area plan come to fruition.I think I like so many of my other neighbors, we just know that this needs proper zoning and a well-structured funding source to make the Loretta Heights vision a reality like active, alive and functional space that many neighbors can enjoy.So with that, I would just like to say the possibilities for this redevelopment become possible because of this down zoning. So I ask for your support.Thank you. Our next speaker is Jim Hartman.Hello, counsel. My name is Jim Hartman. 2120 BlueBell Avenue in Boulder. And I'm speaking tonight in support of the application. Thank you very much for giving us the opportunity. As background and a common owner of many of the investments for as an architect and as a redevelopment specialist over the last 40 years.I'm also speaking tonight as a member and a manager of Pan Christian Hall Partners. We have a very large team that is currently redeveloping and increasing the hall, Eldorado Heights, creating 74 affordable homes for families. And I'd like to stress that the families are going to have large, unique units.Over 50% of our homes. There will be two, three and four bedroom apartments. Not the small ones, not the efficiencies in the one bedroom that you often see. And it will offer deep affordability. 30% Army units, 60%, as well as 80%.We have a very large team. PNC Bank is our major investor grant vantage of proximity. Green is our other development partner, and the city's affordable housing office host has generously provided some essential funding to our efforts. I'd like to say a little bit how we got involved in the red lights.That was over four years ago when City Councilwoman Sally Daigle from Sheridan inviting invited us to attend a community meeting. And we've listened to the community speak for four years now, and it's been really rewarding to hear how much the liberal arts community cares about this campus and these historic buildings and open spaces.I'd also like to echo Jean Myers's comments about Councilman Flynn. He truly cares. And Denver is very fortunate to have his effort at the advocacy level that he's taken to make this campus a beautiful place. I'm really impressed by the land plan.I've been involved in design review committees at Lowry Air Force Base and other places in Denver, and the design standards that have been promoted and will be adhered to and the needs of our community are outstanding. These buildings change buildings.I've seen some preliminary versions and they're good. It's going to be very nicely done. Buildings. They complement our pancreas, the hall and some of the other buildings there, maintaining the views, integrating walkable communities and pedestrian oriented features. All of that is really commendable.It's really about our heights. So my conclusion from all of this is that city council, I really hope that you support and vote yes tonight of heights is going to be a better place for Denver. If you approve this rezoning.Thank you.Thank you, Jim. Our next speaker is Preston Dial. And see. I had seen Preston in the queue here. I don't know if we. Lost Preston, but we'll go ahead and try to get Preston back up into the queue.And in the meantime, we'll go ahead and go to Jesse Paris. Go ahead, Jesse, please.Yes. Good evening. Members of council, those watching at home. My name is just Michelle Paris and I'm represented for Denver homicide or formula for Denver homeless so low currently for Black Star and for self defense positive actually work for social change as well as the Unity Party of Colorado and Frontline Black knows that I'll be the nextmayor of Denver in 2023. I am torn with this redevelopment to me because on one side they try to make it seem like it's a good thing. And then the people from the community, the Bipoc community, are saying it's a bad thing and I have to go with the Bipoc community on this because.This is not affordable. Houses affordable. Uh, I heard something recently. About 30%. And my. How many units out of all the underserved calls for the site are going to actually be at 30%? At my level, even that's not affordable.We need housing that is below the 30% across the board. But every last one of these rezonings, every last one of these proposals, there needs.To be.Uh, 0 to 30%. Ami across the board, whenever you're talking about any kind of redevelopment with housing involved, if you're really trying to solve this housing crisis that we've had for at least the past four years and. This notion that the community was outreach was sufficient enough.That is not good enough there. At previous hearings on the same campus, about the same campus. We heard numerous speakers say that they were not outreach to. So somebody is not telling the truth here. And I'm not going to sit up here and try to decipher who is not or not, who is or who isn't.The fact remains that 30% A-minus was needed, not 60%. Am I not 80% am I? So I would like the ACC or West Side Development to answer the question how many units are actually going to be at 30%?Am I. If this traffic study has been completely done and. Will be implemented. And also who is benefiting? It's definitely not benefiting black. Indigenous people of color. It is a it is benefiting whites, affluent developers and residents. And the people that I spoke with tonight, majority of which have been white, affluent, rich developers and the residents ofthis area that have been in favor of this have no idea of the unintended consequences that are going to come from this rezoning. So we asked you. To not pass this tonight. If you pass it tonight, the voters will know that developers run this town and have the money and the time.We have a lot of this evening. Our last speaker this evening is Preston Dial.Hi. Good evening, counsel. Thank you for having me. I know it's been a long night, so I'll try to be brief. My name is Preston Down, the vice president of acquisitions for Getty Realty, a commercial real estate development company based in Nashville, Tennessee.First, I'm here in favor as a potential partner of the applicant. I represent my client, which is an organic grocer. Two quick things. One, I wanted to commend the applicant and the representatives of the community for preserving the soul of this pretty sweet place.To hear the non-speaking, to hear excuse me, the sister speak and other people, it was it's very special to potentially be a part of this. You know, the big thing that several people have said is the due diligence at West Side is done.I'm here to echo that. There's two things that continued to show up and research. One was affordable housing. We've heard a lot about that. The other was basically this community is a food desert. This place is starving for fresh food, for options with food, for affordable food, for food.I'm here and hopes to partner with West Side in my client, which is a national organic grocer, and hopes to solve that. Here at the Loretta Heights Development. I'll stay on for any questions. Thank you guys very much.Thank you, Preston. That concludes our speakers questions from members of Council on Council Bill three, three, three and or 352. Oh, right. Okay. There we go. I knew I needed to pause for a second. Council member can each.But I believe your muted.Sorry. Changing headphones. Thank you. So what an amazing testimony, but just a couple questions. So the first one is for either host or Jean Myers. So if we can promote them. And then the other one is for Nate Lucero or whoever the attorney is representing community planning and development.So let me switch views so I can.See who's joined. All right.We've got Gene up here.Gene, I might have missed this. Sorry I had to eat a bite of food. We have a long night. I am so excited about the 99 year affordability as I read it. It applies to the for sale as well, is that correct?Right.So I am again so excited. Now, in my experience, I've only ever seen 99 year affordability on for sale in the land trust environment. So I just wanted to check on, you know, the the agreement doesn't have a lot of details on the mechanism, but I understand that when you get to that long of affordability in aland trust, sometimes the land trust has to kind of infuse a little cash to keep the price within the ambit limits while still allowing families to build a little equity over time. Not like spikes in equity like we have in this boom market right now, but just a little bit of equity over time for them to buildwealth. I just wondered how you'd be handling that issue in this particular approach. You know, if you're going to be continuing to anyway, I don't think you have a land trust here. So why don't you figure out correct credibility with without one?Well, as you know, we have quite a bit of experience with the deed.Restriction and we understand when it fails and when it succeeds. And we've had a good track record in our work in Central Park, not having lost a single unit, just by properly setting it up with the title company at the beginning.And so that's our plan.Got it. Can I just clarify, you don't have any concern about the price going up a little bit for owners and then going to high to stay within the 80% of EMI. At the point of transfer, you don't feel like you need any infusion of capital or reset to to do that.Like 50, 70 years out.Well, it's our our plan to just use the the city's structure for ensuring that 80% of EMI remains in place.Okay. Got it. I mean, follow up offline on the mechanism. That's great. I just wanted to ask then for Brad. We had a few speakers and I know I cannot see the slide deck through the the website, the council portal.So I don't know if the public has it either. But can you just refresh folks on the 30% of AMA and 60% of AMA housing that this is not this site is not just 80% of I said it, 80% of your median income.Can you just clarify those other affordability levels real quick?Yes. Happy to thank you, Councilwoman Kinney, so that the agreement with the West Side and all of their developer partners is to incorporate 12% of all the units that created on site as affordable writ large. Among that level, 14 for sale units will be built at a minimum, half of them affordable at 80%, and my half ofthem are affordable 100% my on the rental side. 40% of the units that are that to create on the rental side have to be affordable at or below 60% of AMI and 30% of those need to be restricted at or below 30% of a BMI.And so I say these things in percentages because it's based on the total number of units that are that are to be developed. The last number that I'm familiar with is roughly 1200 across all various phases, which results in 144 total affordable units.All of those percentages applied thereunder. And in addition to that, I should add that Mr. Harvey made this point within his development. But a good chunk of the units have to be two plus bedroom units as well, trying to make sure that we have larger format, family style units to support lower income families as well.Thanks. And just one quick follow up question on that. Can you describe a little bit sometimes people like to focus just on that percentage of units that are affordable. Can you just describe, in your opinion, how there might be tradeoffs between some of the things you just described and the overall percentage?I'm not sure I understand the question, but I think what you're asking is, is why maybe the overall affordability percentage of the total product product development isn't higher, and that is because it does take more resources, more capital, more support and or, you know, more difficult economic modeling to ensure that larger units are created.That lower AMI 30 even 6% units are difficult to to create and given the costs and sort of development materials, labor, etc., land. And so, you know, it takes a little bit off of the overall economics of the entire property to be able to to accommodate identified needs lower down at my spectrum into larger units.Is that what you were asking?Yeah. So there are some tradeoffs here. If you might have had 20% of units at 80% of I and said we have 12% of units, including much lower median incomes for families and more family units. So those are all negotiated.Great. My last question for the attorney, who might that be?We have Nate Lucero. He's in the queue here.Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. I just couldn't see him on my screen. We're on two screens now. Sorry. Thank you. So neat. I wanted to ask about the requirement to have a historic easement not being completed while council tonight is voting on the development agreement.And can you just walk us through what it means to execute the city's agreement and to make sure that we're in compliance with that piece that requires that to be that that separate agreement. It sounds like they're working on, but they're not quite done with yet.I just want to want to clarify that, please.Thank you so much. Nate Lucero, assistant city attorney.Good evening, members of council. So I'm just going to try to walk you through the process practically how it would work. So if council approves the bill this evening. Then the bill will need to be or the it will need to be published.And that usually occurs on Friday. So once once that's taken care of, then the city attorney's office will begin circulating the contract for signatures. And that process usually takes about two weeks. And it's not until all city's signatures are obtained that.That the contract is considered fully executed.So it's possible that the easement gets negotiated.And signed between now and then. I guess.Alternatively, there's a possibility where the city could sort of slow their signature process to kind of see if the easement catches up or if the development agreement is fully executed and there is no easement then. We could consider using the.Default provisions that are provided in the development agreement.Thank you for that answer. And I don't know if this is for you or for this CPD staffer who who negotiated the agreement. But I just want to hear from from from someone who represents the city that if the if this party does not execute any easement for this property, that either we will not be signing orwe will be proceeding to some other mechanism that there is no scenario by which they don't get this easement and everything else goes forward. This is the last bite at the apple for the council, but the city has another bite at the apple.And we won't take it unless we we have an executed easement. I want that assurance, please.Jason Morrison That is correct. I also have a Jenni button work available if you have any more specific questions about what went into that agreement.I'm going to do council pencil and manage. The easement provision was placed in there for two reasons one, to provide short term protection to the Administrative Administration Building and Chapel prior to its designation as a Denver landmark, but also because easements are held in perpetuity.So they actually provide a higher level of protection for a building or buildings, even more so than local designation, which could unlikely but could in the future actually be changed to remove protections from a building. So we do find that this is a very important provision to keep within the day, and we would support it being includedand being a part of this signing process moving forward. Got it. Thank you very much. Thanks. Council president.All right. Thank you, Councilmember Canete. Up next, we have council member Sandoval.Thank you. Council President. I just have one question for you, Jason. How how did you come to the conclusion that you wanted to based the PWDS on C MP, the campus and district growth?I appreciate the question, Councilman Sandoval. You know, again, a lot of this came out of the small area plan process. And, you know, we we learned very often that while this this campus is a very special place, it no longer serve that purpose.And so that being said, a nod to kind of the past of the previous life of the campus and the community wanted to see over swaths of open space, remained on plazas, trails integrated within the redevelopment, and staff felt that the most appropriate bases of district would to be to keep the zone district available and then ofcourse add some modifications to allow for different uses to allow for the protections of those buildings as well.Thank you. And then in the period 24 and 25, they have different citing security or setbacks. And you know me, I'm totally looking at your first me application. So they have different side interior setbacks like the PD, I think 25 have 0 to 10 and then the other one has zero.So is that based on the topography and what you wanted to see an open space with with the book plane inside? That's how you got from the based on district to the waivers or down to the PD.And just to clarify you, I just pulled up my staff bracelet to make sure I was answering your question correctly. You're speaking to the G 25, is that correct?So they can be pretty G 24 has a ten side that intercept that great and then PD G 25 had 0 to 5. So they're not the same. So PD 24 and PD 25 have different side interiors effects and different type of other just building coverages and maxes.So I just was wondering how those comparison charts were created, where they created based on the topography and what this small area plan recommended, recommended. Does that make sense?It does, yes. So thank you for clarifying. So it actually has less to do with the topography and more of kind of the feel of the area. So it's a big reason why we have superfoods in the campus study, which is pretty g 24 is is more of kind of a, you know, a quieter kind of, youknow, residential office type type setting and versus kind of some of those mixed use contexts as well. And so a lot of it is a nod to kind of the the open space in the area. And so the residential pretty does have setbacks and the campus community doesn't have setbacks.So it is kind of that that, you know, distinguishing between the two kind of like fields of the buildings and kind of what the community wanted to see between the two different areas of the site.Perfect. Thank you, Jason. Thank you, Madam President.Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval. All right. Giving it one last moment here. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 333. Council Member Flynn.Oh, thank you. Thank you, Madam President. You're hearing Sister Mary. Inspired me to open my remarks with something very special about this place. This is a this has been a four year journey that's been instrumental in reconnecting the Sisters of Loreto and the Loreto community to this sacred and beautiful space.They have been gone from the ownership and management of Loreto Heights for 30 years since they completed To Regis. And then. And we won't go into the. The Jesuits will leave the Jesuits at peace for right now, sister.They flipped it over to the Tokyo group out of Japan who ran taking on Loreto Heights for the next 30 years. And so the Loreto, the sisters and the Loreto community really have been connected to the campus for those 30 years and is one of the most beautiful things about this process, Madam President, is the fact thatthey are now once again an integral part of the fabric of the hides. And maybe if I could just take one moment. To disclose a thing that something that just happened today and that is the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure has agreed with our request, my request from my office and the Sisters of Loreto to use legacynaming for some of the streets that are contained entirely within the campus, rather than having them have the names from the surrounding grid to which they don't connect anywhere. We were faced. Some of you I mentioned, as we were faced with a prospect, if we followed the grid that this former Catholic Women's College would have a streeton it named Hooker Street. And I have to commend Sister Mary now for a nun. She's got a great sense of humor. She said, well, if we have to have a hooker street, there has to be a street intersecting with that that's named Mary Magdalene.And I just thought that was a great, great sense of humor, sister. I really appreciate the broad support that the community, including the City of Sheridan, by the way, which closely borders a campus, as well as ten southwest Denver registered neighborhood organizations that supported the area plan two years ago and the seven that support this rezoning, oneof them conditionally. I want to mention especially for thanks Jason Morrison, who was the lead is from Tennessee and the rest of the CBD team Jenny Button board from the Landmarking Office, Deirdre Oates who came in to to work with us tirelessly on this as well as the department heads, primarily Laura Andretti.Julia's likely from Dottie, a lawyer from CBD, Abbey Hanes from Parks and Recreation. But I think the most thanks goes to our neighborhood leaders and our residents who spent years hard hours hammering out a consensus that, while not unanimous, represents the top of the curve of what the community wants.Thanks, Sister Mary. Now in particular for constant involvement due to Annie Levinsky in historic Denver, our neighborhood leaders. Claire Harris. Tara Durham. Cassandra Cornelius. Donna Rip. Aaron Manhart. Richard Sides. Adriana Pena. Tony Hernandez. Others I'm sure to mystify.If I kept going, I'd leave some folks out. Madam President and colleagues, this site in Southwest Denver presents us in our part of town with our first major development project in a quarter century, which was Grant Ranch back in the nineties.This presents us with the opportunity to create the kind of community we've always said we want diverse in population, in household incomes, to combat displacement and gentrification, income, restricted, affordable rental and for sale housing, including, as you heard, required deep affordability levels of 60% and below and 30% and below multi bedroom units because we are a familyneighborhood. Dedication of another parcel for and another affordable housing a project still to be selected. In fact, this is the approach to combating displacement and gentrification. Embedding permanently affordable income restricted units, along with Gene Myers could have mentioned this.I didn't hear it specifically, but some of the market affordable units that thrive will be building will be priced for less than some of the housing, some of the homes already in the existing neighborhood. So double the amount of open space that's required a revitalizing and landmarking the iconic destroyed buildings.This is the first housing development to use the Denver Green Code preservation of key view corridors both to and from the site height restriction so no building can ever overwhelm that beautiful Frank Ed Brooke, 1890 Loreto Academy Building Preservation of the cemetery where 62 sisters of Loreto have their eternal rest.Vision zero centered street design that places people first. One of the key things to know and that I quickly learned about this, Madam President, college going into a complicated and diverse issues such as the future of Loreto Heights, is that with so many competing needs and desires coming to the table, no one.Going gets everything they want, but everyone gets something they need. It takes a lot of intentional work for every party to this site to see how their specialized interests necessarily intersect with impact and affect the other parties. And that takes a lot of coordination and really, really wasn't easy.This was the first LDR project to go to. That first project, you go through that LDR process. My Southwest Denver community has been engaged with the potential changes on this campus since shortly after the college announced more than four years ago that it was closing and selling the land.Excuse me. Now, I hope that's not my time running out. That's my clock at the top of the hour. Long before the current owner came on the scene, we learned a lot about what the stakeholder group said, what they want to see, but more importantly, what they don't want to happen on the campus, too.With the first potential buyer that came along was a California developer who didn't even want a zoning change at all. He simply wanted to use the existing campus environments to match out nothing but residential. The campus zoning would have allowed around 10 million square feet of residential in buildings, up to 12 storeys, covering up to 60% ofthe land area compared to what could have been. What we have in front of us now is a clear path to a truly diverse, multi income, multi housing form, integrated community parks and trails, historic landmark preservation, deeply affordable housing.It will give my district four new landmark buildings. Joining are Fort Logan Field Officers quarters as the only Denver landmark buildings in Denver, west of the Platte and south of Sixth Avenue, a situation that I hope we work intentionally to change as time goes on.This hasn't been easy. The community came together to create the first specific neighborhood small area plan. In my district, the participation by the public was extraordinary 1300 unique participants over nearly a year. My office led the effort to increase that involvement by repeating the initial public meeting as a monolingual Spanish meeting that attracted 30 participants canvasing theLatinos serving businesses in the neighborhood. My office paid to leaflet for each meeting hanging fliers on one at one one occasion up to 13,000 doors throughout the Southwest and into Sheridan. The overwhelming community consensus was for a unique place that preserves the feel of the campus far into the future.As a result, many of the housing units, if you look at the residential building, many of those units face onto parts, puzzles or open spaces, as you might find on a campus in the summer of 2019, West Side allowed one of the RINO's to hold their summer picnic in the quadrangle.And as my wife and I sat there watching 5060 people enjoying a barbecue, the Denver Municipal Band Brass Quintet playing some yard games and whatnot. That place really came alive again, and if you had been there, you would have seen what the future of this special place can be when you come to Loreto Heights to live, work, play or hopefully attend a show in the revitalized May Montes Stanton Theater, you will know that you've entered a community where all are welcome. So building on the great respect for the past, to fulfill the spirit of Loreto that Mother Pan Croatia bought brought to this hilltop in 1918 88.Pardon me? I ask for the support of my colleagues for both the development agreement and the rezoning. Thank you, Madam President.Thank you. Councilmember Flynn. Up next, we have council member Clarke.Thank you, Madam President. Well, the land here is in Councilman Flynn's district. You know, college view, the neighborhood that is in my district. And in addition to being very important to a lot of my constituents, also a very important place for my family because we're out of heights is what brought my mom out to Denver.And so I won't go in and repeat. I know the hours late and we still have more work to do. I just want to echo all the things that Councilman Flynn already gave. And he he said it better than I could anyway.But I just want to add a thanks to Councilman Flynn for his just continued being plugged into every little piece of this all along the way with the community, with the developers, with the city staff all the way to the, you know, the the push to get these streets renamed in there and just really a service tothe community that I represent and and to my family. And so I just want to say thank you, Councilman Flynn. And I'm very excited to support this tonight. Thank you, Madam President.Thank you. Councilmember Clark. Councilmember can each.Thank you. Council President My kudos to this community for coming together to hear a lot of testimony where there's consensus. Sometimes it's about convincing the council, but other times you can tell it's about the community celebrating what they've been through.I understand it might not have been universal, but it was overwhelming. And I just want to acknowledge that and just say how great it was. My kudos to Councilman Flynn and to the staff. My staff probably Kyle monitored much of this process and participated for my office and helped us answer questions and respond.But, you know, several times these negotiations over this development agreement hit impasse. And I just have to say to the developer team for stretching and staying at the table and hearing the feedback and understanding how important this was.Even the price differences between when you started negotiating this agreement and what they are today is is notable. And I hopefully, hopefully you feel like you understand more why the city pushed as hard as it did and to the city for continuing to advocate for for these high standards.Anyway, there were a lot of staff involved in this, and you are typically the unsung heroes. But I just want to sing you for a minute. This this was kind of a test project for a lot of things.And we had a developer who hadn't done a ton of affordable housing before. And so, you know, bringing in the partners and etc.. So, so to everybody who had to stretch to get to these outcomes. Thank you. And just stay at the table and get that easement done.All right. Thanks. The historic easement, that is. All right. Thank you, everyone, and congratulations. Thank you. I'll be supporting it tonight.He's right.Thank you, Councilmember. Coming up next, we have Councilmember Sandoval.Thank you, Madam President. Similar to Councilman Park, Colorado Heights is what my from my mom, from Minnesota to Denver. She graduated from greater heights and is a co member of Laredo Heights and retired, but now is working part time for the Sisters of Loretto.So I have heard all about this development from my mom and the numerous sisters that she works with, and they have had nothing but positive feedback to say. And as I was thinking about what to say, I'll just take a quote from their website.It says The Laredo community works for justice and peace as it educates the young and or serves the poor and marginalized, protects the environment and advocates for the voiceless. And I really believe that that's what this project does, and I really believe that's what this process has been.And so thank you. Councilman Flynn, I know we don't have very many rezonings in District two, so congratulations on a job well done. And me, I love the zoning code. And as I was digging through the application and seeing all of the details, it was really beautiful to see.You have requirements that I would like to see in school and tourist in my district where you don't have open, can you have back doors to the open space? You have front doors to the open space and you have requirements in these parties that I'll probably piece apart and make into another overlay in my council district.So thank you for leading that because that's exciting. That's something I've been saying I would like to do along the Platte River, along Lakewood Gulch and all the gotchas. So thank you for being a leader in that and creating new tools.And with that, I'll be supporting it.Very good. Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval. And not seen any other hands raised. I'll go ahead and make my comments here as we vote on Council Bill three, three, three, reminding folks that we also need to vote on 352 as well.But congratulations, Councilman Flynn, way back in 2019. I remember seeing Jason in our satellite space at the city and county building, and I kept asking, I'm like, What? What is this guy doing? Why is he always sitting back here in our satellite space?What the heck? And it was. You were doing your thing, Councilman Flynn. You were big and down into the details. You were making sure that this would be a development, that you could be proud of, that the community could be proud of.And I think the amount of speakers that spoke tonight in support shows that, and especially Sister Mary, Miss Guadalupe, a miss Lydia. They are the folks that in the speakers, this space and this sacred ground means so much to them.And change is not easy. It's never easy. And when you have folks that have deep ties to this site saying that they're supportive and that they believe in this process. You've done your work and you've done it well.And so I want to congratulate you, Councilman Flynn, and I am happy to support this this evening as well. And we will go ahead.

The Committee approved filing this item at its meeting on 3-30-21."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nAnd that would be, I think, what I'm going to do. I'm going to skip if it's okay. Do you mind being the last? And I would bring up our our last item, which will now be the one before last, which is our chaplains.And we are this is proposed ordinance 2016 0293. For those of you that are online, just, just yesterday we did a a motion motion a motion because we had the problem that this is trying to solve. So yesterday we had the problem and today we're having the solution.So how's that for Speedy? Are you going to. Oh, I'll just talk about it really quick. So basically various denominations, faith based denominations, donate materials such as Bibles or Korans or any kind of literature or newspapers so that people that are incarcerated will have.Access to them, which I believe is required by law that we make that available. So I have here a list of all of the different groups that donate to that. And currently, our law, which was in 1979, is that.82.72, so that the dollar amount could only not exceed $2,000. And as we know, inflation has happened since 1972. So this would make us able to do that up to the dollar amount of $15,000. And I think that that's more appropriate at this time.So, Mr. Curry, would you take it away?Thank you, Madam Chair. And Clifford Curry of Council staff, you pretty much give them my staff report. So just a couple of quick notes. Is that as the as the Chair noted, the code requirements that require council approval of donations of $2,000 or more has been in place since 1972.However, the Council has acted in other areas to provide exemptions to certain agencies, recognizing that the $2,000 limit is very low. For example, you've increased the limit for animal and animal services, public health and for parks and recreation, giving them exemptions of up to $50,000 to receive donations.This particular ordinance would extend an exemption for having council approval for a donation for religious materials and texts, educational materials and books. Are those donations going to the Inmate Welfare Fund? The Inmate Welfare Fund provides services religious, educational and recreational services to inmates, both in the county's adult and juvenile detention facilities.It's paid for currently with phone call revenues and revenues from vending machines. By expanding the amount of donation that could be received by the department, that department does not have to look at the cost of going through the motion process.And any donation of materials means that the inmate welfare fund doesn't need to spend money to provide those materials, and as a consequence, it benefits the inmates, both with the donation and by reducing the pressure on the actual inmate welfare fund.And. Madam Chair, that concludes my staff report. Director Hayes is here to answer questions.Mr. Hayes, welcome back. It's been 24 hours. So is there anything that you'd like to add to this?No, just that this kind of helps us streamline things so we don't have to come back to council to get approval for a donation of more than $2,000. Last year there was only two donations, more than that. And then we realized that we the ordinance had limited us.So that's one reason why we're here yesterday. And hopefully this will help us in the future to streamline and and accept these donations from the generosity of the communities.And I know we have two chaplains or one chaplain with us, three chaplains for chaplain chaplains. And if any one of you want to say anything at the microphone, you'd be more than welcome to do that. They brought this to me because they said it was slowing down, getting literature to the people and they just wanted tospeed it up. And so I wouldn't have known that if you hadn't come to talk to us about that. And we thank you for your service and making sure that whatever the faith base is, that everybody's religious use can be observed.So thank you. Any questions is Councilmember Gossett.Thank you, Madam Chair. Councilor, I remember you mostly characterizing this as religious donations. When I listen to Cliff and read the ordinance, we're making more flexible the donation or contribution of religious materials and tax, as well as other educational materials and books to the inmate welfare fund.So if I want to give ten copies of Malcolm X Speech Speech or the Autobiography of Malcolm X to the jail, it would appear to me that I can do it. It is provision, am I correct or not?That is correct. Mr..COUTTS Okay, so it's not just religious contributions. All right, I want to make sure that.It also would allow computers and the director and I are are figuring out we haven't gotten there yet, but figuring out how to get some computers at some point because there's some really good opportunities that are for free to help inmates if we could just get the computers in there.So and just just to fully answer your question, Mr. Dyson, this was intended after discussions with the department to ensure that, again, the donated materials tend to be religious materials, which for obvious reasons can be very expensive. And the other area where there is a significant need for inmates and a benefit from receiving donations are educational materialsused for literacy, GED, etc., etc. Those kinds of donations are very beneficial, both the inmate to the inmates and to the inmate welfare fund by the county not having to purchase those materials.All right. Thank you.So thank you. And we will keep working on how we're going to get those computers. So but that's for another day. Any other questions on this one? Okay. And we have our previous director that thinks it's fine, too, so that's great.All right. Is this before us? I don't remember. Is mine. So would you put it before us?Councilmember Garcia, did you want to move it now? Okay. All right. Be happy to move adoption with a do pass recommendation of proposed ordinance 2000 60293.Thank you very much. No further comments. Please call for the vote.Thank you, Madam Chair. Councilmember Baldacci. Councilmember Dombroski. Councilmember Dunn. Councilmember Garcia.I.Councilmember Caldwell's. Councilmember McDermott. High Councilmember of the Grove. Councilmember one right there. Madam Chair, I. Madam chair, the vote is six. Is council members done up the grove in Brunswick Borough?Excuse. Thank you very much. So seems that would be fine to put this on the consent agenda. And do you have some backlog things that you need to be processing or this can be in the regular time. Regular time.Okay. So consent agenda, regular time. And thank you very much and thank you to all the chaplains. We so appreciate you. Thank you. This now takes us to our last item of business. And this is something and believe it or not, it's been on my mind since 2006.\nSummary:", "answer": "AN ORDINANCE relating to gifts, bequests and donations of religious materials and texts, other educational materials, and books to the inmate welfare fund; and adding a new section to K.C.C. chapter 2.80."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThe bill passes and the chair will sign it. See that C rim report of the. Not I guess not committees. We have a report from previous previous items on on the agenda.The report of the city council agenda one Resolution 319 25 expressing the Seattle City Council's opposition to the Trump administration's escalation toward a war with Iran and two attacks on the democratic rights of people with Iranian heritage in Washington State and requesting the Office of Intergovernmental Relations communicate these offers excuse me, these positions to the Washington StateCongressional delegation.Thank you. Would customers want to address the resolution?Yes. Should I? Should I move to substitute, speak to the substitution. Then we take a vote. And then I speak to the best of.Yes. That sounds great. Would you like me to move or would you like to?I'm happy to move. And then if you stick it in, then I just want to say something. I move to substitute version three of resolution 319254. Version one.I second. Thank you.Did you want to speak to it or.Sure. I appreciate the opportunity to work with Council Councilmember so on over the last week as well as the Office of Intergovernmental Relations and additional stakeholder groups beyond ones who had been consulted.As of as of last week.And I feel that in although there's been some concern about the the resolution becoming weakened after our weeks worth of deliberations, I think in many ways it's actually been strengthened because we have really, I think, honed in on why it is appropriate for the Seattle City Council to weigh in on this and and and the impact ofthese international actions on residents of our city, the impact of actions that are happening at the border on residents of our city. And so rather than just simply being a resolution against certain international actions, we are really focusing on our values as a city of being an inclusive, welcoming city and pointing to, I think, a lot ofthe strength of this community, while I hope preserving the intent of the language in the resolution to also be a strong antiwar statement.Thank you. Council President Pro Tem Herbold I It was my original intention to have this resolution in opposing Trump's escalation to toward war in Iran last week. But we needed to hold it. And as Councilmember Herb also having talked to us, the Office of Intergovernmental Relations Governor Herbert Office proposed a series of amendments just before the votelast Monday. And I do agree that this resolution is a strong, resolute, strong enough resolution. And I really appreciate my colleague for working with me and my office to find the language for the substitute that we can both accept.But I do want to state for the record that the original substitution that was offered greatly weakened the antiwar language and the whole motivation behind the disastrous history of U.S. imperialism and why this war should be opposed. As our Sharifi said, the reason we are opposing the war in Iran is because we know what has happened toprevious wars, and it's important to recall that in the resolution and this is also what Dan Gilman from Veterans for Peace was referring to. However, thanks to all of your organizing, thanks to hundreds of people, ordinary people writing to city council and calling and urging that the resolution not lose its antiwar character.We have arrived at a version that I think does present a strong case from the city council, why we are opposing the resolution. And so I, I will support this substitution and then I'll speak to the resolution and thank you.So it's been moved in, seconded to amend the resolution. Are there additional comments on the amended version of the resolution? Councilmember Morales.Just in general on the resolution, is that a no on the amendment?Will we speak to the resolution itself after we get the amended version in front of us if you have comments on the amended version. Okay. All right. With that, those in favor of the proposed substitute vote i. I.I those oppose vote no. And the motion carries and the resolution is amended. We now have the amended version in front of us. Are there any further comments on the resolution as amended comes out of this?Okay.Sorry, I'm new to.This as a sponsor, I'm going to defer to of course, on first.Thank you. This is the resolution in opposition to both Trump's escalation toward war with Iran and also in opposition to reports of Border Patrol agents targeting people of Iranian descent at the border crossing in Blaine, Washington, and at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.Trump's policies towards Iran, including airstrikes and the prominent drone assassination of Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani in Iraq, are risking war and that is totally unacceptable. The U.S. wars in Afghanistan and in Iraq have not expanded the freedom, democracy, standards of living or safety of ordinary people in the Middle East and have not increased the safety ofpeople in the US. Instead, they have caused massive loss of human life and ongoing suffering in Afghanistan and Iraq and among US soldiers. It is ordinary people, especially women, young people and marginalized communities who always pay the greatest price for imperialist war.As a socialist elected representative, I will do everything in my power to prevent another disastrous war in the Middle East. And I look forward to the whole city council taking that position. In 2019, working people in Iran, Iraq and Lebanon both inspiring mass movements against poverty, corruption, ethnic oppression and authoritarian rule.However, now the threat of war with the US has undermined the momentum of these movements, especially in Iran, and strengthened the authoritarian Iranian regime. Instead of threats of war, we need a mass antiwar movement in the US and globally in solidarity with the movement in the Middle East.In drafting this resolution, my office looked to see if there was a precedent set by the City Council in 2003, when Bush drove the U.S. to war with Iraq, using similarly sketchy intelligence reports claiming imminent threat with no details.We were shocked. I was on I wasn't on the council in 2003. We were shocked to find a 2003 resolution that totally failed to oppose the war in any way, which I think really illustrates how our movement has now, in the current time, moved politics in this city and nationwide.Just to read the first few lines of the resolution passed on March 18, 2003, by the Seattle City Council, two days before the start of the Iraq War. It says, quote, A resolution in support of the men and women of the armed forces of the United States, expressing our pride in their service.Whereas the President of the United States has activated and deployed numerous men and women of the armed forces from Washington State and from Seattle to the war in Iraq, and to assignment in Afghanistan that are related to the ongoing war on terrorism.And. Whereas, their service in our armed forces is one of the highest traditions of American patriotism. This is on. These are the words of a progressive city council about a war started by George Bush. And so let's be crystal clear.It is dishonest for a ruling elite to engage that engages in endless imperialist war in order to apportion the spoils of global capitalism among themselves, while they exploit the majority to then turn around and talk about well-being and pride of the soldiers who are sent to fight their wars.The best way to keep your soldiers safe and protect their well-being is don't start endless war. Another casualty of war is the democratic rights of people at home. Border Patrol agents in Washington state are now targeting people of Iranian descent, including U.S. citizens.People have been detained and questioned for hours, including families with young children, as they return home to Seattle through the border in Canada, near Canada or the SeaTac Airport. We have heard personally from people who have had these experiences.My office spoke to a representative from the Port of Seattle, which is the government entity that operates the SeaTac Airport. First, we were told by them that there was no increased targeting of nor increased targeting of people of Iranian descent at Sea-Tac so far, which is clearly not true because we are hearing incidents that are happening.But then he they claim that this was what Homeland Security is claiming. He then told us that Homeland Security is expecting to start increasing its targeting of Iranian Americans at the airport. This is extremely concerning to us. But what the public should know is that this person, from this representative of the port then told my staff, Irequested my staff member that we avoid the sort of peaceful, civil disobedience protest that we had organized at the airport in 2017, which was a protest that joined similar actions at airports around the country and which helped temporarily halt Trump's Muslim travel ban.My office has, of course, told them that we are not going to stop any civil disobedience protests at the airport. And in fact, if peaceful civil disobedience is required to protect our Iranian sisters and brothers, and that is exactly what we will do.And so it's my it's been my pleasure to work with many of the groups, including Veterans for Peace, the Council on American Islamic Relations. And I should also mention all the activists who are fighting for the India resolution are also strongly supporting this resolution.And I've been part of that as well. And. Alice.Thank you. Well, I want to thank everybody first for being here and taking time from your work day. If you needed to do that to be here. I know that's not easy. And I do want to say that I stand in solidarity with the people of Iran and heritage who have been unfairly targeted by our Border Patroland law enforcement following the assassination of General Suleimani. Our neighbors should not be questioned or detained based on their ethnic, religious or cultural identities. Doing so follows the dangerous tradition of condoning race based discrimination, which we all know becomes enshrined in government policies that exclude people from their ability to pursue prosperity.We have governed based on fear before in this country, and it has led to shameful practices like entering our Japanese-American neighbors, who somebody spoke about earlier. And by questioning the loyalty of longtime residents who deserved their shot at safety and prosperity and opportunity.We know that Seattle must oppose any discrimination against immigrants and refugees and reject the escalation of war with Iran, which puts the lives of millions of Iranians, Iranian Americans and Muslims at large in greater danger. And I am supporting this resolution.Any other comments, Councilmember Peterson. Yes.Thank you to everyone for being here today. Taking time from your busy days to tell us your thoughts on these resolutions. I share the passion and views of my colleagues about these important matters, and I thank you for raising them.I appreciate that. Colleagues have spent many hours over the past week revising the original resolution. Every day I'm deeply troubled by the rhetoric and actions of the Trump administration. I will vote yes. And so I will vote in favor of this resolution, because, of course, it's wrong for President Trump to start a war against Iran.And of course, it's wrong for our federal officials to discriminate at the border, at our airport or anywhere. I will vote yes. And also, please allow me to ask that we try to not craft a city council resolution for every horrible thing that our president or any world leader does.I believe we can do the most good and deliver the best response as elected to City Council members by proving how well a government can be run. And by government, I mean the city government of Seattle. I believe we could research, right, review, debate and vote on a new resolution every hour of every day to counter everybad thing that President Trump or his administration does. But every minute, as a legislative body, we spend researching, writing, reviewing, debating and voting on these resolutions is a minute. We could be spending to reduce homelessness, to improve emergency medical response, to make sure we get through dangerous snowstorms, to oversee a city budget of $6.5 billion, spanning over40 city departments, impacting over 700,000 people right here in Seattle. So. But I do support this resolution. We must speak out against these injustices. We should. I believe we can send letters of our support to congressional colleagues, to our Port of Seattle colleagues.But to take up time before and during city council meetings for all of these resolutions is a slippery slope where we could take our eye off the ball of running this city government. So, again, I'm voting yes. And I'm confident that our congresswoman, Pramila Jayapal and our U.S. Senators Murray and Cantwell and our esteemed port commissioners aremore than capable of dealing with this situation with or without a city council resolution, which I will support today. Thank you.And as the proposer of the resolution, if there's no further, folks who want to talk about allow Councilmember Swann to close out debate.Thank you. In closing out, I wanted to respond to the comments made by Councilmember Peterson just now. He used terms like that. If we pass or if the council acts on resolutions such as the Iran resolution or the India resolution, that is somehow it's going to be a slippery slope and direct the city council away from thecities deaths in my in my view saying that the city council is in danger of passing a resolution on every injustice going on in the planet is a strawman argument. That is not what the City Council does. The purpose of these.The purpose of such resolutions as the two that have been brought forward from my office is not for. For me as an elected representative or someone else to take a pro forma or, you know, just in name only position against oppression and check off that box.The purpose is to use such resolutions as a tool to empower and build social movements, which is ultimately what makes the difference. We are. I as a city council member, I am under no illusion that simply by passing a resolution here, things are going to change.What the resolution does do is it empowers the movement to keep building. And we know that a yes vote on the India resolution from the City Council will not only empower the global movement against Modi's regime, but beyond that, actually, it is going to be nothing short of historic because it will be the first such position takenby a legislative body in the United States.And last. And as far.As the local questions are concerned and if there are any concerns by Councilmember Peterson that somehow we are not paying attention, let me tell you, I've been on the council for six years. The reason the city council continues to oversee an unprecedented crisis of homelessness and housing unaffordability is not because we are passing too many irrelevant resolutions, but it is because of the lack of moral and political courage to do what is needed urgently, which is to tax big business and find a major expansion. Tangible, publicly owned, high quality social housing as part of a Green New Deal program.The climate change and housing crisis are the two crises facing the city urgently, and that is why that is what we need to do. But passing resolutions is not the barrier. The barrier is a lack of courage, and that is why I hope everybody will join us.The Dogs Amazon Action Conference this Saturday at 10 a.m..In favor of adopting the resolution as amended.Vote i.I.I.

Motion is carried.Item 41.Reporter on Health and Human Services recommendation to execute an agreement with Los Angeles County to receive and expend up to 5,236,895 of Measure H funding to implement homeless initiative strategies citywide.Mr. Mark I think the Council wanted maybe a short kind of update on this measure measuring rate.Can we call it?Good evening on a mayor and council members. So this is an annual measure h funding. And what is reflected here is about 2.7 million of new funding coming through measure H in addition to the rollover of approximately 2.6 million.So those two together, this allows for that rollover and to continue to move forward with, uh, with homeless services utilizing the measure h funding. So the measure H funding primarily focuses on homeless prevention, rapid rehousing, outreach, a coordinated entry system as well as case management.And are interim housing considered under the strategies of Measure H the crisis bridge housing. So as you know, the Measure H is one of the many funding sources that we receive and it is the the primary source from the county in addition to other statewide, such as a half or the federal continuum of care and other services. And so this is one of the funding sources that allows us to put together our entire program operating out of the MSI and with our partners with that close representation.Thank you. There's a motion and a second. Please go and have one member of the public. She can be pushing forward.They still proud some of the six. With respect to the 32 page equity toolkit that was presented with this agenda item, there's not a single initiative in that 32 pages that is doing anything to end homelessness. You have a language access policy.There is a homeless encampment on 24 Columbus Boulevard. I take my grandmother there to get her Social Security check. There's not a single person out there. If I brought them to my article. INTERPRETER That will say, at last, I'm ready to no longer be unhoused.I do not know why we are misappropriating county funds to do nothing to end homelessness. The beacon built at Long Beach in Anaheim is 160 affordable housing units at a cost of $530,000 a unit. Operation Homekey, which was utilized by the county to buy the best Western on Atlantic in Anaheim for $21 million.$21.7 million is at a cost of $20,000 per unit. We are grossly misusing this money and it's not doing anything to end homelessness. You have 32 pages. You have direct install gardens, language access policy, the climate adaption plan.These are these are the initiatives that are going to end homelessness. They aren't doing anything. This is affecting either the policies or the people that work on them. Great job. But that's not what this funding needs to be used for.I pay property tax. I pay $32,000 in property tax. I pay for my mother's house, my grandmother's house, and my aunt and uncle's house. I don't mind paying taxes. What I do mind is you guys misappropriating what my property taxes are being used for.It should be used not to pay for. They're all gone now. The poverty pimps, but the eggheads with the student loan debts who come in here and they bring poor people in here and they say, hey, to stay a renter forever.They're not pushing homeownership. Homeownership is how you get rid of and end homelessness. It's not by perpetual rent ship. Until Blackstone and BlackRock bypass apartment buildings, it's become homeowners. So we need to be using this county money to develop homeowners.I don't see in the equity toolkit a first time homebuyer program. I don't see anything that is substantial. It's just developing and furthering the bureaucracy. I'm sorry, I didn't I didn't get a liberal arts degree. You know, I work on my hands.So, you know, I got to go outside and work. And these people, I don't know what they're doing with taxpayers money besides wasting it. We need to see some of this measure h money being used to develop either homeowners or expand in preserving current affordable housing.If you look at the motels there exist in the city, even in sixth district, you can easily buy up 300 units of affordable housing by buying at the motels a.s.a.p that went through. Thank you.Thank you very much for listening.RICHARDSON Thank you. Just so first of all, we're glad that we have our own continuum of care. We continue to get the right funding. And I agree with the last speaker in terms of homeownership, but I do want to highlight that we do have a first time homebuyer program in the works being funded by the recovery plan. And so my understanding from 2.4, that's one of the first programs to roll out of the recovery. So we look forward to sharing more details very soon.Thank you. We have a motion in a second. I just want to add, because I think that really spoke to a lot of what I think a lot of us feel some time. And I just want to just reiterate to the team that I do think oftentimes we get stuck in the academics of how to fix stuffand not just focus on kind of the bread and butter issues of actually getting people in the homes buying motel rooms. So I actually agree with a lot of the public comment that was said. But I do have a question.Can we get a report when we get back in January on Project On and where we are in the process? I know of multiple times and Ms.. Tatum has done a great job of working on getting us the current three sites we have.I know we have requested to purchase more. We know we have money coming down the state. I feel like all of our focus should be on purchasing motels and getting more folks to folks house. I also think that we should be less worried about.The ongoing. I know. I know. I know. What stops us from purchasing more is oftentimes kind of staff's concern about the ongoing cost after a few years. And I understand that. But I don't want us to lose sight of taking care of the emergency in front of us because we're worried about what can happen four years fromnow having to pay for it like that for hopefully mature age kids comes in or the programs from the state. So I just want to put that on the table. I do think, by the way, that staff have done a great job in in the project roomkey project Roomkey space.And so this is not a criticism of that because I think we've done a great job with the three projects, what, 250 units, I think total. But we, you know, if we're not purchasing another in the next few months, you know, one or two of the buildings, then I think we're not spending our homelessness dollars the rightway. And so I think that that's got to be our top priority, is actually purchasing all the motels. And it's also fixes blight issues. The Motel six, let's say, over in Council Councilman Price's district. I mean, there's, like, zero impact to tubes.I'm sorry. Cancer, super nodes, district maps. So six. Thank God. I did great job with that project. But that that that project, for example, and I heard directly from from neighbors and friends that, you know, that live nearby who were really worried and everyone is agreement that there was little to no impact.The other two projects that we've done in the city, the county partnership's incredible investments. So I'm just really grateful for the work you've all done. And I'm hoping also that we stick to the bread and butter and homelessness stuff.I think that's that's hopefully the the future. Councilwoman, actually, I may have skipped town. We got that. You have. You were the second.Mayor, you said. Oh, thank you.Councilman Mongo.Thank you. I recently was sent a thread of some communications related to some individuals online, and I read through it. And one of the things that I think is really critical with all of the projects that we're doing is communication.So. Often. A few times we try to throw out my term, my multiple terms on council. We have tried to host homeless forums where community members could come forward and hear from the legal side, the compassion side, the law side, and all the different components and the complexity of it.And I think that they're very beneficial. I'm heartbroken that Sarah Green is no longer in the city attorney's office. She was so articulate in communicating to the community how the system works and what processes are in place on both sides to both protect the homeless community and protect the residents.And then the complexities of the prior legal findings and other opinions that have come out. I want to applaud. I believe Councilwoman Allen had a recent homeless forum with similar components to it. But I really believe that that's the city's job as a whole.Council offices cannot take on the sole responsibility of that communication. And when I read the threads of what the solutions are that community members are bringing forward and their perception that the council doesn't care because we're not implementing it, I think it goes to our our failure as an elected body and quite frankly, as a city incommunicating that clearly my council office can continue to do it as long as I'm in office. And the 70 to 150 people that come to it can benefit from it. But we have thousands of community members who want to help solve the problem.And if they're not informed on the legal standards and requirements that are in place, they're not able to triage with us and support and help us find the solutions in those. So I would just like to say that I'd like to see the city take on that responsibility.I don't know if Councilman Allen has any additional input because I know she's done that. And then finally, I'd like to say that when I talked to the Housing and Housing Services Department, one of the questions that I've asked in the past is how many people that are on housing assistance have gotten off housing assistance?What programs do we have in place to do that? To create a voucher to be available for someone else who needs it. We are only adding and contributing to helping those that need it. But what are we doing to get the people who are receiving that help up into the next level of economics so that they thencan be a part of the next level of solution? And so I'd really like to see our transparency on those numbers through our dashboard. I've asked for dashboards in the past, and there was always all these complexities. The pandemic came and dashboards are amazing that we're doing such a great job with them on the pandemic.I would love to see a dashboard on assistance programs on homelessness. It is a crisis and we need to be transparent. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Ciro. But I thought we spoke already. That is in addition again.Yeah. Okay.Bye. Richardson.I just, you know, since it came up, I would say I want to make I want to. I like the project calling to the room key. I want to make sure that we go back to prior to that, we looked at hotels, the nuisance motels.Since we've done that, I don't know that we've crossed the two, but if we're in a position to sort of free two birds in one key, I know that there have been challenges in terms of the rules on a state funding.Maybe we look at relaxing those rules, particularly, I know of five nuisance motels from Long Beach Boulevard, North Long Beach that are great potential sites for one of these. And after it serves in that temporary capacity, it could turn into supportive housing or something that's a bit more stable for that neighborhood.And although that used to be the neighborhood I represent and it's no longer I think it's still a issue of of great importance to the broader north, obviously, I think city wide. So let's use this tool. We've seen that project HOMEKEY works.And we also know that we do have corridors that have nuisance motels and need to be addressed. I thought that needs to be raised. Thank you. I'll second that and happy to carry the mantle.Councilwoman Sarno.Thank you, Mayor. I really want to reiterate and add to Councilmember Mango's comment about communication, because, you know, I think that when you talk about homelessness funding, you see this big number like it's always in the millions or thousands and it's really hard to grasp where does that money go?Right. And I think that that is where a lot of my resident ask, because they see the same issues occurring no matter what they've been advised to do, no matter how much activities they try to figure out to do and how much ideas they get.And so I think that we really need to invest some type type of time, staff, time or energy or expertize that can really communicate the work. Because I know staff is doing amazing work, a lot of work, a lot of ideas, and I just don't know where what is being done even on just it's hard for meto even grass so that I can communicate this with residents on where the investment is going into and how we're working towards our short term, mid-term and long term solutions. You know, when we talk about housing, that is supposed to be a longer term, but what is it intermediary like?You know, we know that we provide assistance, but it's really unclear in between and how many staff is needed to do that, all of that. Right. So I think it would be helpful to have some kind of not just dashboard but like some kind of annual report or something that can be, you know, that we can utilizeso that we don't have to create them individually in our office. And the thing is that often gets to me is I hear from residents, oh, it's happening here in nine, 813, because we are the lower, you know, resource area, lower invested area.But I think we need to paint a bigger picture that it is not just a city, but a national pandemic. And I think we need to speak to examples that, you know, what are we doing all collectively to locally, right.So I just want more communication materials so that we can point to it as a city and and also within certain parts of how we are really addressing it. So thank you.Councilman Preston, that I'm going to have to make some comments.Soraya and I wasn't planning on queuing up to speak on this, but the public comment, I mean, if I could have. Decently shouted Hallelujah in the middle. I would have. Because, I mean, we just get asked all the time about where the dollars are going.And it's it's very difficult for us, at least for me. I'll speak for myself to explain because there's just so many nuances in that space that it's hard for residents to understand why we can't just directly fund certain things to solve the problems.I do I do want to recognize, you know, the mayor mentioned the project, Homekey project in my current district and I worked really hard on that project and I want to thank Theresa Chandler and Tracey Colombo or were partners in that with me of course Kelly as well.But we worked really directly and.I.Feel like we we manage the whole we proactively message and Tom and Linda were part of that conversation. We knew it was happening and we proactively messaged it in a way that signaled my early support for the project.So we were able to kind of, you know, address the concerns before it was even really announced. And we worked together really well, I feel like with messaging with our county partners. Then we had a community meeting, it was super positive and the facility actually opened up two weeks before it was supposed to and my staff said, You want to do an announcement on this? I said, No, let's let it open. And then we can tell people it's been open for two weeks or maybe even a month, and then they'll see that what we were saying about the facility was accurate, that there were no impacts, nobody even knew it had opened.And the key was the kind of operator we had and that was really, really good. So I think the operator I mean, I go by there all the time and drop off cookies and things for the workers there because they do a really good job respecting the space that they're in.And you would never know what that that uses there. And so I feel like we should be supporting more and more projects like that. I also think I to Councilwoman Mungo's point, I think we are very inefficient with how we disseminate the information because every council office is independently responding to emails, individual emails every day about thelegal legal hurdles in the space of homelessness. And one, we probably shouldn't be giving legal summaries because it's it's very it's just so nuanced. And to, you know, even I, I feel like I understand it better than most.I mean, I read the legal opinions and even I have had missteps before where something I said wasn't completely accurate. And I think that's it's really important. So I feel like I wonder if there are some funds available for us to have a communications officer in the area of homelessness, someone who's like, and I hate to saythis, I really do. I can't even believe I'm going to say this out loud. But I am.Next sure to.Come the question 100% of the questions, 99% of the questions are about homelessness. And I have a very good friend who's on the Newport Beach City Council. Same thing. It's not like it's unique to Long Beach. It's the number one concerns.They get there too. Obviously different scope, but we should have somebody who's accurately paying get paid a lot of money to respond and and to put the actual legal what we can and can't do as a city on these social media sites because it's a put it on the burden.To put that burden on the council offices is a tremendously inefficient responsibility and a hugely inconsistent.Because each of us communicates very.Differently and the message doesn't come out as clearly as it should. So I don't know exactly how to do that, but I feel like in the social media space, we should be using some resources to educate people. You know, we're I'm I tell everyone all the time, I'm happy to debate with you all day long.Trust me, I actually enjoy it. But I want to operate from the same fact sheet, right? Like if you're just making stuff up about what the options are for the city and I know those options are illegal, then we're debating.It's an efficient debate, right? We're not debating reality. So I feel like if we had a communicate, if we dedicated some of our homeless money to communication about homelessness and dissemination of that information and engagement, I think it would be a money really well spent.Has the perception of the public is that we have a lot of solutions that for whatever reason we're choosing not to implement. We have a lot of money and we have a lot of solutions. That's just not that's not reasonable.So who communicates that from a collective voice?Thank you.Thank you. I personally agree with everything that's been said so far. I want to add a few things. I think one is I think what you're sensing from the council is the frustration. Also, I think I think the Council on numerous occasions has asked our team to focus on communicating, on bringing in team members, to get informationout, because we're doing actually really amazing work. And I think what's happened is I know for a fact that if a resident wants to get information about homelessness, their best bet is to call a city council office. It's not the call.The AC or to call the health department and try to find who the right person is. They're getting direct information from members of the Council of Staff. I believe that to be true. I've heard that from numerous members, numerous, numerous residents.And I think that also has to shift, because the burden of responding to homelessness has been put on everybody at the status and we spend on the team spend a significant amount of time answering questions that should be answered by the team and Health and Human Services Department.Not to say that they're not answering questions because they're answering a lot of questions as well. But there is, I believe, no strategic effort to communicate, one, what we're doing, but to to help people understand how they can actually help us and assist and then what's not actually possible.One thing that's always been frustrating is when we came up with the Everyone Home Plan, which I thought is a it's a great, very simple to understand set of of initiatives. We, we stopped communicating it after a while.We don't continue to bring it back up and communicate what we're doing. Definitely, we're not actually implementing what's in the plan or doesn't mean that we're not focused on trying to solve those issues, but we certainly aren't communicating it.And so I just want to just kind of reiterate what Councilwoman Pryce said, that I would like to see resources actually spent on serious, proactive community engagement so that people understand what can and can't be done and what actually how they can actually help in a way that's productive.So I totally support that. And I also ask these funds, the 5.2, it's going to the CFC. Has this been line item doubt as to where it's going to be spent? Or does the S.O.S. decide how does that work?I'm just curious about that.This is an raised funds. So these funds are line item. There are very specific strategies. So Measure H has I can't remember something like 20 strategies of which we get a set of those strategies and the rest are provided by the county or other providers.So these strategies, the is hunger prevention, rapid rehousing, outreach, coordinated entry and crisis in bridge housing. That is the only thing that we're allowed to use the measure h funding for. And so I did want to, you know, share that.I think, you know, we're certainly happy to bring forward more information on sort of the chunks of funding and how they're utilized. You know, when almost all of the work is grant funded, they have very specific outcomes we're allowed to use it for.And so that is something that I want to share. And we'll I'm happy to bring forward and share more of that measure.H money not allowed to be used for communication.It is not so. But we have we we have carved out communications funds through one of our other grant sources and we are actually meeting tomorrow to start a communications strategy, meeting around homeless services. So it will be coming back with more information on that.We were moving forward and then COVID hit and as the health department and all of the things basically take over all other communications, and I do apologize for that. We know it's very important and we are looking forward to bringing forth a strategy back to you.Because I think we're also hearing is we're actually really proud of what you guys are doing. Like everyone loves like the work and knows how hard it is, but I think there's a disconnect. I don't certainly feel that we're communicating that.And I don't think and the public certainly is not receiving the information and the communication needs to be proactive, not passive. And and this is something that we've talked even more broadly about the city, and I know that that's being worked on right now, but I think that we keep coming back to this question, how we're communicatingwith the public, and they have a right to know what we're doing. And that's not an area that I think we are doing very well as a city. So I'm hoping that we can have some more conversations about how this is going to get fixed as our budget moves forward and as we talk specifically about what isthe biggest crisis in the city, certainly post-COVID, and that is when it was before COVID. And that's, you know, our in-house population, how we how we get them housing. Councilman Mongeau.Thank you. I've attended some of the major meetings I get around all of my c all the agendas. Not only can you not use it on communication, you also can't use it to move people who are receiving aid out of the need to receive aid, which I think is a weakness of the strategies.But the strategies were created with community groups and community organizations. And while I did see some Long Beach staff members attending on our behalf and advocating for certain things, the number of people advocating and the types of things they were advocating for were different three years ago when this passed to where we are today.And I think that that's something else we need to consider and at. Except for I think that right now, at this point in time where we're days away from switching large areas of our city and what councilmember is the main communicator to those individuals?We're at a point where there's going to be a huge shift in gap. Even with the amount of information and meetings that I've been to, both at the county level, the regional level and the local level related to certain areas of my district that have sometimes three and four agencies at play.And the amount of work that my office has singlehandedly done in bringing together and having community meetings where the state senator, the representative of the supervisor of district, a representative from the City of Los Angeles and my self in my office are all in one meeting in a community because there's actual areas that have homeless encampments thatin an area the size of this room, there are four jurisdictions at play for. And that is very frustrating to the residents. And those areas are now the primary contact will become councilmember supervisor. And what I'm concerned about is the six years it took to get to where we are and the communication that it would take.It has to be a citywide process. We can't be in this position again. And so I go to these meetings and then individuals say, this area has not been cleaned up in three years and my office can state this area was cleaned up on this day.It was a rollback on this day it was cleaned up again. On this day it was a rollback on this day. We've offered services 76 times. There are 34 people in the encampment. Of the 34 people in the encampment.84% of them have received more than ten contacts. We can do that because we have great relationships with homeless services. But that can't be on a council office. It really needs to be on the city staff. And it's also an equitable the number of calls we get across council offices.It's just unreasonable for certain offices to receive thousands of calls a year and others to receive hundreds. And we all have the same budget and the same staffing, and that doesn't leave an equitable response rate for constituents. And that's not fair.But I will say thank you to my staff who were crazy hours and make sure that everyone gets a response despite the fact that we get 12,000 calls a year.Just one more thing. One last question also. Did we I know that we've talked about this and it's check chicken, for example, have we funded Mr. Givens and his project that he's been trying to get funded in all the amount of kind of trash and homeless services that provides is that that we were and were able todo. I know I think many of us have been asking for for him to get support for like a year.I believe we were able to get him the vehicle that he was looking for. The truth. Can add that I yeah.So we've been working very closely with Mr. Gibbons to get him to apply to the mayor's fund.And so, as you know, there's a process for application and we've been trying to support him in that process and his board who do the application. So we were able to get him away or the truck so that he can start doing the pickups.So that was a donation from the city, but we're still working on the application process for funding.And it just seems like there's just a lot of process to get through an application process to just give I mean, the amount of work that he's doing on his own with his volunteers, it should we should be like throwing resources at him and not not going through an elaborate application process that my $0.02.So what I'd like to ask is what's the what's the timing on this money. So if these resources we approved tonight are. They what I want to see in January and I'd like to have this conversation back on the council agenda, if I can ask the the Vice Mayor to amend the motion just to have a discussionabout resources around homeless services and how we're going to invest in communications. I'd like to see that on the agenda. January, if we're just in, is willing to amend the motion.Absolutely. Okay.Do we have public comment on this item? But it also will prove the money that's on the. That's the.Idea.That's right. That's right. Okay. So we'll have that conversation in January, one of the last week of January. And with that.Well, Mr. Mayor, I'd like to make a few comments, please, if I may. Sure.So as we carry loud and clear, I.Think a lot of you brought up some very good points. In fact, just about a month ago, three weeks ago, we brought together all of our department heads to really talk about what's working, what's not. Where are areas of improvement?And that strategic management retreat really talked about a lot of these same issues, though. We recognize the challenges. We recognize. Communications is probably the top thing that every of our departments talked about. I do want to provide some context.Our health department is grant funded and they've gotten huge amounts of resources through grants and almost none of it paid for. A lot of the things that we wanted to pay for the administrative staff, the the customer service staff, the communication staff, and so over the years, we've actually had to build some of that through some othertypes of methods. For example, they've never had a POW ever for, you know, decades. And about two years ago we found a way to invest in that and with our own money, with SFP and did some really creative things.So they can at least have one position that's done that. And that person got rerouted completely to coronavirus this year. So we understand the need for it. I really want to do better with communications. I think we have an amazing story to tell and that is an area that we just are lacking some of the funding.A lot of our funding is incredibly inflexible. When we did the measure H, one of our big requests of the city was don't chop it up into little tiny bits and give us little pieces because we want a direct allocation to us because we know how we can spend it the best.And that was not approved by the county. We spent time in all of those different committees and they wanted their very specific grant funded approaches and then they only gave us little pieces of that. And so you'll see when we had a chance to talk to the management team, where's the money going?Where is it coming from? Where's it going? And you'd be surprised that almost all of it or a vast majority of it is required to go for housing people and only for housing people. And so we'll be able to show you a lot of that.I think it will help you understand some of the challenges, including like when you buy a motel, you have to then operate it and there is no money to operate it. And so that is like for each hotel, it's in that 2 to $3 million range structurally every single year and there's no money coming to operate those. And so we took some risks in the last two years to add those things, even though we didn't have the plans to fund it. And now we're trying to figure that out and then we've got to figure out how to go further.So I do want to I do think it'll be healthy to have a discussion about, you know, what are some of the opportunities we have and then what are some of the challenges. And as Kelly said, Collins is one that we're very much focused on and that those discussions are underway.And we'll report back to you in January with hopefully some solutions.Thank you. That's really great. That's a that's a that was a great update. So thank you very much.

I recommend my colleagues support this item. This is. I know normally we don't have patio dining permits on. We don't take them out of consent. But this is one where the community was very involved and it's at the request of the community that we've pulled the item.So I imagine they would like to come and speak to it. I'm not sure. But I will say that we've worked very closely with the community on coming up with the particular design for this patio dining area. I believe the architect is also here.The business, the community and our public works department have worked very closely to address the concerns in this for this particular location, because it's located within close proximity to a lot of homes. Have also talked with the business owner who has been very receptive in terms of making some operational improvements that will continue to enhance the relationshipsbetween the business and the community with this expansion into the patio dining area. So with that, I'd recommend approval by my council colleagues.Thank you. Is there any public comment here?Yes. Very quickly. My name is Maureen Neely. I'm the president of the Belmont Heights Community Association.

And we're at the point where we've got a design we can live with. And like the councilwoman said, she's also committed to working with the operator to make sure all of the other smaller bumps about having an operation and right insidea neighborhood next door to residences is as painless as possible. So thanks again and appreciate the opportunity to speak. I don't see the architect here, but the design looks pretty good, so. Oh, hey, Nathan. Okay, thank you very much.Thank you. Fantastic.

Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Members of the council, thank you for having us here this evening. I'm just going to provide a little context. Before Carl Hickman, our traffic engineer, provides the the formal report on this. And there's a misconception, it appears in the public that the discussion between temporary parklets and permanent parklets and that theexisting temporary structures could potentially be converted to permanent. And before we get started, I just want to make sure everybody's clear that that is not the case. Permanent parklet structures have very different requirements than temporary parklet structures. I'm here to tell you tonight that none of the temporary structures currently anywhere in the city would qualify as apermanent structure. And in each case, those structures would have to be removed and a new structure would be installed, assuming that it meets the requirements of a permanent structure, which are a lot more stringent than the temporary ones.So just to start it off, I wanted to make sure everybody understood that any discussion about making temporary parklets permanent does not mean that the existing structure would be revised to be considered permanent. So that said, I'd like to turn it over to Carl Hickman, our traffic engineer, who's going to give us an update this evening.Thank you.Good evening, Mr. Mayor. And council members. This has been a long road. We've been working on Parklets now for 18 months or so and we've done quite a bit of work in public works to make the parklets of the program happen.Let's get started. There's a little bit of background regarding the parklets. Again, it was a citywide effort to support the economic recovery for businesses amid the social distancing health order. The first temporary parklets were installed in May of 2020.There was a vast majority that were installed for the 4th of July weekend in 2020. Programs peak citywide there were 124 temporary parklets 136 participating businesses because many businesses share parklets. Currently citywide, there are 96 Parklets installed and 99 participating businesses.Ten Parklets have been removed since September alone because we are in the process of removing Parklets. When we find that business owners no longer need them or they may request us further removals, so we do have an ongoing process.When I'm contacted to remove the park, this whenever possible. Now as a licensed traffic engineer, one of my main concerns with apartments is safety. Here are some of the safety elements that I look at when we consider installing temporary parklets.We want to look to see that we have that object marker on the corner of the park that you see the yellow and black sign. That designates the corner of the parklet. We want to make sure that the remaining traveled way that's the roadway between the edge of the parklet and the centerline is a minimum of 12feet. Now we can varied from that occasionally, but it depends on the situation. 12 feet is the typical standard. We do look at the structural elements of the of the parklet to make sure that it is sturdy. We also fill the plastic rails, a minimum of three quarters of the way with water to make sure that theyare able to withstand the impact from a vehicle. We do look at many stormwater drainage elements to make sure that along a curb line, water can flow like it normally would along the gutter. We also look for safe pedestrian passage on the sidewalks, make sure that there's 88 clearances and we pay close attention to utility complex.There were some cases where some of the properties were installed over the top of gas lines that we didn't know existed. And then we found out later that we had to make modifications because we couldn't have the gas lines underneath the temporary parklets.And I want to reiterate that existing temporary parklets cannot simply convert automatically to a permanent status. These temporary apartments are not designed to be permanent. They are installed with temporary type materials. So any modification to a permanent status would be a major redo.Now, back in September, we were asked to take a closer look at the Belmont Shore area. Why is Belmont Shore unique? Well, first of all, it's a pretty high dense neighborhood, high density, a lot of businesses, services, amenities in the area, especially between Bayshore and Livingston.A lot of visitors visit the area. There's a lot of pedestrian activity, as you know. And of course, there's the nearby residential homes on both sides of the street. Second Street is kind of narrow, actually, although it's two lanes in each direction.It's still a relatively narrow roadway and it provides a direct link to PCH, Pacific Coast Highway. So really, second Street acts almost like an arterial that is really meant to serve a large volume of vehicles. Obviously there are impacts to nearby residents with all of the activity in the area.It is an attractor, definitely. And of course, as I mentioned, all the traffic that goes up and down. Second is an important factor. Also the area does impact the coastal zone on the area from Livingston to Clermont is actually in the local coastal zone.Which means that any kind of discussion with the coastal zone and a decision by the local coastal zone would mean that is not appealable. So current conditions in CD3, in the entire council district, there are 38 total temporary parklets and 38 participating businesses.On Belmont Shore Loan from Second Street to Bay Shore, there are 25 temporary parklets. 30 participating businesses. Four Parklets are shared by two or more businesses. Three businesses have a pair of temporary parklets. That means one on second and one on a side street.And we also removed eight temporary parklets to date again as businesses contact us or we deem them unnecessary. We do the removals as quickly as we can. One of the issues that has come up quite often is the parking impacts in Belmont Shaw.And we did a very good inventory of all the parking spaces and we found that there were 517 total metered spaces on street, there's 351 and the public lots, there was 166 total, again 517 so far to date, as we sit right now, there are 56 stalls converted to temporary parklets, 38 stalls on Second Street and 18stalls on the side streets. The total available for parking still is 461 stalls. So really we've converted 11% of the total available metered stalls to parklets temporary parklets. 7% on Second Street and 4% on the side streets. And there's a graphic representation there, you know, with your pie, the slice of the pie that shows the 56 outof the total available 517. Now, since the beginning of the program, we've had many opportunities to reach out to the public, reach out to businesses. And most recently, we reached out to the folks on Belmont Shore to have a community meeting.We've started public and business surveys. We've had multiple discussions with CD3 and we've had multiple field inspections and business visits where we talk really candidly with the business owners, talk about are they using the the parklets? Are there any problems?Do we need to make any adjustments? It's an ongoing thing and it's not going to stop. And we really think that that one on one conversation with the businesses is really a good, healthy conversation because the businesses need to understand how they're impacting not only the area, the residents, the street, but the city as a whole.Because, you know, Belmont sure is an important part of the city. So regarding our outreach, we have three parts. The first part of our outreach really was related to the business owners themselves. So we had a total of 584 total responses.And of those 584, there were 12 businesses that responded. Ten businesses are interested in keeping the temporary parklets through June of next year. Ten businesses are interested in applying for a permanent parklet. 83% agree that their temporary parklet helped their business recover amid health order and social distancing.And they also admitted that only 2% are staff to at least 95% of pre-COVID levels. One of the business owners said many guests still do not feel comfortable dining indoors but want to support local restaurants, etc.. The next step in our outreach was that we wanted to talk to residents and customers of the 584 responses.You can see on the on the pie charts a lot of the percentages. I won't go through all of the data, but you can see that, you know, in the center there, 30% of the customers never really use the parklets.19% use them once a month, etc.. On the far right, you can see the chart that talks about neighborhood foot traffic, what kind of pedestrian activity is in the area, and 56% supply of the comment that there was really no change in pedestrian activity.I'll leave that there just for a second. If you want to take a quicker look. A longer look. Part three of the outreach. We again had 584 total responses and there were 572 customer or resident responses out of the 584.38% support the program. 11% support but with restrictions. 12% are concerned about the parking. 6% traffic sightlines. 14% congestion and parking. And 9% were concerned about accessibility and esthetics. So on the right you'll see that the top concerns were the parking impacts, sidewalk access, esthetics, driver sightlines noise, especially on the side streets and quality of life issues. Quality of life issues could mean some of the patrons in the restaurants or bars maybe be loitering alongside the businesses or near the residents. Some of those quality of life issues could be excessive noise. There were a variety of other complaints, again, that we call quality of life that may not be directly attributable to the parties themselves. But nevertheless, the issue is there that needs to be addressed. And there's, again, a variety of positive feedback. Many folks value the outdoor dining option. It improves the walkability and enhances the experience. Character of Belmont Shore. Now, since the beginning of the program, we've always worked to do ongoing adjustments or improvements.We address each issue on a case by case basis. We remove temporary parklets by request. As I mentioned prior, we constantly look to make sure the departments are at the right footprint, in other words, in front of the business.There are many cases where over time the actual footprint or the perimeter of the park, this has been changed. You know, some of the business owners are kind of pushing out a little bit and expanding. So we want to make sure that people have the parklets where they're supposed to be.We're checking in and filling barricade water levels and we're making sure that businesses who are nearby are okay with any encroachment into their areas. And we continue inspections by staff regularly. Now after the Open Streets Initiative ends again, existing temporary parks are not approved or designed to be permanent.We have an existing permanent parklet guideline shown there on the left. That's the cover of it that's been used by the city since 2008. So it's nothing new. We already have that program in place. And if you're in the downtown area, you'll see many permanent parks already installed.On the right there, you'll see a poster board somebody created. And the first sentence says that the city of Long Beach is considering making outdoor dining parklets permanent. That is not true. We are not pushing to make temporary parklets permanent.Now moving forward on Second Street. We do already have guidelines in place for businesses who want to make permanent parklets. Here's a picture of a business the socialist that fought in Saint Louis. You'll see how the sidewalk pushes out or bulbs out away from the business a little bit further.And their they're of utilizing the hardscape to put their tables and chairs, etc.. So this is a standard that businesses who are near a corner could implement. Obviously, it's going to be for the business to install. They're going to have to pay for it.But this is an installation that we are already doing in the city, so it's nothing new. Next slide here. Again, this is what we would call a semi-permanent parklet. Again, this is an existing location, Berlin Bistro Fourth and Linden, where as part of the guideline on the right there, you'll see how we design this type of aparklet to be semi-permanent. If that business were to go away, we could technically remove that parklet and it would be a done deal. So ideally I mentioned earlier in the presentation that we had ten businesses who were interested in becoming permanent parklets.And really I think that that was sort of a knee jerk reaction to our last meeting back in September, where many businesses were probably unsure of the program, where it was going. A couple of those businesses who have applied to be permanent, we were already removed their temporary parklets.So but let's look at the worst case scenario. If those ten permanent parklet businesses who want permanent parklets were to actually get them go through the process. We're talking about a loss of approximately 20 stalls. The original total meet total needed spaces is 517.So we would only have to convert 4%, approximately 4% of the stalls to permanent parklets. And I want to point out that businesses need to understand that when it comes time to do a permanent parklet, not only do they have to go through the rigorous process that's already in place, but there will be a cost associated withthat to design the installation, etc.. And I'm predicting those costs are in the neighborhood of 40 to $50000, depending on the the nature of the exact install. So again, this is not something that's just a slam dunk. There is a rigorous process already in place.So to wrap things up, we do have recommendations for Second Street, and I'll go through them slowly here. The first recommendation is to continue improvements, adjustments and inspections of existing temporary parklets. This is what we've been doing for the past 1820 months, making sure that the businesses are operating as they should be per their permits.We're going to coordinate with businesses, businesses to remove temporary parklets whenever possible. Again, I mentioned where it's an ongoing process. We're going to work with businesses not interested in the permanent parklet so that removal of the temporary parklet can take place as quickly as possible.We're going to check and refill all water filled barricades, maintain proper approvals and assurance documentation. Businesses have their insurances last quite frequently, so we have to make sure that we're on top of that. And again, anybody who's going to be interested in a permanent parklet, we're going to direct them to the existing sidewalk dining and park thishandbook that is already in place since 2018. The next thing is Pakistan. Minor side streets will no longer be allowed in cases where there are multiple documented violations. The key here is multiple documented violations. Next. Businesses interested in a permanent Parklet must communicate in intent to apply for a permanent parklet by January 31st of next year.This will allow businesses to keep their temporary parklet until June 30th or 22 as they work through the process to finish their permanent parklet installations. We're going to organize a single effort to obtain local coastal zone approval for the businesses on Belmont Shore.We're going to facilitate permanent parklets that meet current construction and safety standards. And our overall goal is to allocate no more than 3 to 7% of stalls to permanent parklet installations. That concludes my presentation. And we are ready to field any questions that you may have.Thank you. There are two people queued up for public comment. Please come forward. And Jason Ileus and Brian Cochran. John, excuse me, John. I this is John here. Okay. Is Brian here? Okay, come forward. Brian. What was that?John? Okay. All right. Make your way to the front. Thank you. Good evening. My name is John Ayers.And I'm a property.Owner in Belmont Shore.As do parklets. Item 47 Parking in the short takes away needed parking as it was addressed and increases the occupancy levels for restaurants without providing adequate parking. Restaurants often have sidewalk dining as well as parklets for those who don't want to eat indoors.Today. Owners. Restaurants can select indoor dining as well as sidewalk dining. Again. I sent a. I had expressed my concerns a couple of months ago. At the at her. Council meeting. And I also sent a text to each council member in the past two months months expressing what I had just mentioned.Thank you. Thank you, Brian. Good evening, Mayor Garcia and city council members. I first like to thank Councilwoman Suzy Price and her team for continuing this important dialog on the park issue and for engaging our constituents in a robust, thoughtful manner.That's been very helpful. I'd like to urge the Council tonight to stop viewing and stop framing this issue as an either or situation that in order for businesses to survive, all considerations of residents, valid and exhaustive concerns must be secondary or worst ignored entirely.When the Council met on this issue in September. You heard from actual residents detailing both personally and on behalf of their neighbors the deep and detrimental impacts of these markets on their daily quality of life. 13 speakers addressed the council.All residents there urged a no vote on continuing the program. The other five speakers were all business owners, managers or employees of those businesses. Is it any surprise they urged continuing the program to their benefit. Similarly, with the Public Works surveys, which seem to gain the questions to get a desired outcome, what kind of a fair surveyactually points out that a business owner in the district can fill out three surveys? Of course, they and their customers want to keep the parklets running. It benefits them directly. But after the vote of that September meetings concluded, only one one owner stuck around to talk with residents and expressed an interest in their needs as neighbors andto suggest he'd help with the quality of life issues. Just one owner. Since then, we've only seen abuses of these public spaces continue unabated and worsen. I walked Second Street again repeatedly since then on November 20th alone. I photographed vomit on a sidewalk next to a restaurant so much that a mom of a stroller had to skirtdelicately around the stench near another restaurant. Piles of sawdust or judgment remains after some sort of food supply fallen in the street and occupied three or colleagues. Since the council turned to a lot of parklets, it's long overdue to enforce existing laws and rules and track every issue in a simple and transparent manner.City agencies and language police must be responsive to noise, traffic, trash and mobility complaints by the residents who encounter these abuses daily. This is not a new issue. It's not an either or. Since these businesses have been granted a lifeline by the city and its residents, it's essential that they act as good neighbors and accept responsibility forthe impact of their moneymaking endeavors that have caused residents so much of their quality of life. Councilmembers Pleas and the Parking Program on Second Street in the Pier Arts Interchange. Please put some teeth into enforcing the abuses created by the program.Thank you very much.Thank you. That concludes public comment. Taking behind the dias, Councilwoman Fries.Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. So I want to start by thanking our staff for your work on this. I know that beyond just the three gentlemen that are here tonight presenting, there is a team of people whose work who have worked very hard on this issue, and they've been engaged with my office throughout the entire few monthsthat we've been studying this issue. And you've really taken their concerns to heart, and this report is fantastic. So thank you. I really, really appreciate that. I also want to thank the community members. We had so many community members volunteer to go door to door to pass out the cards for the surveys.And that was really important. And I think that's one of the reasons that we had about 584 responses. And and so I want to thank them both. The Belmont.Shore Residents Association and the and the Friends of Belmont Shore were two community.Organizations that worked very closely with me on this issue. It's interesting when you have an issue like this, because depending on who you talk to, they will swear that everyone they have talked to agrees with them on the issue.So over the last couple of months, I've gotten emails that say, you know, I have lived in the city in certain number of years and I everyone that I have talked to insert opposes or supports the PARKLETS and I just have gotten a ton of emails like that and there's absolutely no consensus by the residents entirely onthe issue of Parklets on Second Street. And I will say that I suspect and there's probably some data to support that multiple people took that survey. The Baltimore people took the survey multiple times. And I don't know which side of whether they're supporting our opposing, but the survey is meant to be an outreach effort.It's not a scientific survey. It's an outreach effort to try to gauge interest. And I want to thank staff for putting it together. I also want to thank a staff for clarifying that. And I'm not sure where this confusion occurred, and I'm disappointed that it did.But the permanent PARKLET program is totally different from the Open Streets Initiative. We've had permanent parklet options available in the city forever. All of this in my district, the social list. These are all businesses that have gotten permanent parklets way before the COVID pandemic even hit.So to conflate those two is has has mixed up the message quite a bit. And in fact, I myself, when I was reading the presentation earlier, thought Slide 15 was relevant to our current situation and not the hypothetical situation of permanent parklets being issued.So there is a lot of confusion there, and I just want to thank staff for clarifying that. I do want to point out that some eight, I believe, is that current eight parklets were removed. Eight Parklets were removed as a result of our discussions and our efforts.And what we did was we went out and Mr. Cochrane talked about the business owners that were here last time. Both the Panama Joes owner, as well as the Georges Greek owner, stayed after the last council meeting, and the Panama Joes owner actually voluntarily removed their parklet.So we've had eight parklets removed, which to me is tremendous. If we're talking about parking spots lost, this huge number of parking spots gained. We also were able to remove some parklets. Some businesses had two parklets like fills, and we were able to remove that.I want to. Okay. So a couple of questions for staff. I think enforcement to me is the biggest key here. And I'm going to approve staff's recommendation. I'm going to ask I'm going to vote in favor of staff's recommendation and I'm going to ask my colleagues to do the same.But I do want to make a motion, and I know the city attorney's on the line. I'm going to turn over to him in just a minute for Art Sanchez. I'm not sure if he's in here or on the line, but I do want to talk a little bit about every Parklet permit committee has to follow certainguidelines and standards, and there are good neighbor policies that are outlined here that basically say any violations or the permit can be revised, the conditions can be revised if any complaints are received and the permit may be revoked.If there is a nuisance.Situation. So I want to turn it over to the city attorney, Mr. Sanchez, and ask him if you can explain to us what that process is, because I would like to have a report back within 30 days that highlights what that process is and what efforts we've made to outreach to the community, what that processes for apermanent revocation of a temporary parklet for a violator of the good neighbor policy. So, Mr. Sanchez, can I ask you to explain that?Certainly. Councilwoman Pryce. So what would happen is we would have to have documentation of whatever the violation is, and it would have to be it would be done by venue task force at this point. And once we receive the documentation of the violation, we would reach out to the business owner, have them make somewhat immediate corrections, andif those corrections aren't made, we would move forward with removal of the parklet. Now that's you know, it's kind of in general in terms of the removal, assuming that violations exist and violations aren't corrected in a timely manner.Then we would post a notice providing the business with 72 hours to basically remove all items that had been collected at the parklet. They have an opportunity from. I believe, five days after the posting of the notice to request a hearing to appeal the removal of the parklet, the parklet would still be removed.The appeal would occur after the fact, and then we would just have that hearing and make a determination about the removal. And that is generally the process. If you have any questions like I've tried, answer.Okay. So my time is up, so I'm going to.Take.You back up. For it.Okay. Thank you. So, Mr. Sanchez, is there any way that we can document that process so that residents are aware of it? Because I know that residents have called the police in regards to some parklets and feel like they haven't had much of a process.So is there any way to document that process and then outreach it?Um. Yes, I guess we could have it done through a combination of public works and the venue task force can come up with a written process that outlines that it can post it. I guess it would be on the Public Works website.Okay, that sounds great. And my office will also help in getting the process out to the community once we have a process. And I think within that write up, there should be some sort of clear identification of what that threshold is.Is it just a simple complaint is a sustained violation. You know, a lot of times neighbors will call, for example, of a good neighbor policies, talk a lot about noise and loitering. So what happens is when they call that in, oftentimes code enforcement is not in a position to respond at midnight or 11 p.m. or even 9:30p.m.. That's just those are not hours that code enforcement is able to respond. So then the resident is really left without recourse. And so I'd like, you know, a call to the police department and a police response to to qualify as one of the documented complaints that was either substantiated or not.So just nothing. I'm not making a motion as to how you effectuate this this process, but just a suggestion for when you do write it up that it would be good for residents to have some clarity. So with that, I do want to highlight just a couple of things.Unless, Mr. Sanchez unless there's anything else you want to add.In response to the talking points that I just raised.But, yes, so in terms of the violations, there would have to be some investigation that would be conducted. That investigation would include reviewing whatever calls for service that are for that particular location. And so that information would be reviewed.That would be some of the things that we would look into to confirm that the activity or the violation is occurring at that particular business.Okay. Thank you, Mr. Sanchez. And that takes me to slide number six. There's a bullet point that says Parklets on minor side streets will no longer be allowed in cases where there are multiple documented violations. So the attorney in me is reading this saying, what's the definition of minor and what is documented violations mean and what isthe staff's recommendation as to this bullet? Are we going to be removing any parklets that currently exist on the side street?Yes. To answer your question, Councilwoman Price, the minor side street would be any of the streets that intersect Second Street perpendicular, so streets like Glendora, Saint Joseph Park, etc. those are the minor streets. Second Street is the major street.That's how we refer to it. And traffic engineering. And then when we talk about multiple documented violations, again, we're talking about what Mr. Sanchez referred to as when someone goes out and investigates, you know, did they hear a loud noise?Was there a health order violation? Was there some or some other kind of quality of life issue that was documented? And then when we have, depending on the severity of those issues that we that are documented, when we have a significant number of those that are documented, we can move to the next step to possibly start theremoval process, the notification, working with the business owner to correct if possible or go straight to the notification and the posting of the notice to remove.Okay. And I assume that we're not pressing reset tonight as if no violations have already occurred, that what has occurred in the past that has been documented will be considered by staff moving forward?That is correct. And we are quite familiar with many of the so-called bad actors out there and what's been going on.Okay. All right. Thank you. I appreciate that. And on behalf of the residents, I thank you for that process. And, you know, I do I will say that we talk a lot about the loss of parking. In fact, I was at a friend's apartment short meeting the other night and someone was talking about the loss of parking. It is an 11% loss of parking. And, you know, one of the speakers talked about when we occupy those parking spots, we're not filling them. And so we're under parked. But a lot of the parklets are filled mostly in the evenings and a lot of our retail shops and services are closed at those times.So the parking spots that would be allotted, let's say, for the large lounge as an example or any other business or even fills, those parking spots really aren't used at night.So people will go to the restaurants.At night and they'll have more parking available because so many of the service businesses and some of the retail shops and daytime businesses are closed. So. So I support staff's recommendation. I know. It's not going to make everyone happy.But I do appreciate that we are eight less as a result and that we're still working to reduce as business needs change for the restaurants. And yes, this is a business friendly initiative, but it's also an initiative that we're trying to make resident friendly as well.So thank you very much. I appreciate it. And thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor, for indulging me that few extra minutes.Sure thing. Thank you. Members, please cast your vote and then we'll go to 34.She miscarried.

Craig Cogen with the downtown Long Beach Associates. I'm going to keep the accolades to a very minimum, but I really want to take the time to thank the council and city staff for serving as a strong partner with the Dolby and many of the accomplishments that we've been able to achieve in ourdowntown, downtown as everyone's neighborhood. And I think we've we feel that strongly throughout the throughout the entire city. And I thought about this today when I when I considered my comments that Vice Mayor, we have had a great relationship over the last ten years.And I realize that tonight might be the last time you vote on this contract. And I'm hopeful that anyone who does serve in that same seat that you do that we have half as much success as we've had over the last ten years.So I appreciate your support. I appreciate the dedication that you have provided us throughout the years of living in the downtown, serving the downtown, and certainly being a strong partner and understanding the importance of bids, especially for our downtown.So thank you very much for that and we look forward to your support. Thank you.Thank you, Craig. And I want to thank you for your leadership. From the downtown bid, I. I have said this many times before, but during our worst times in the city, our worst recession. Somehow the downtown managed to not limp along, but really thrive in so many ways.And and I know that the prosperity wasn't necessarily shared by all. The recession was indiscriminate in that regard. But it certainly was wonderful to be able to see progress in in such a vital part of our city. And I thank you for that.I think the many board members that have served on the bay and the many residents and small business owners and other business owners that have come together to really reintroduce the downtown. When you see the downtown today, it is not the place that I certainly moved into in 1997.So it's been a personal joy for me to see that growth. Thank you for that.Thank you.Members.

Council Bill 20 1-689 has passed. All right. Moving on to our next required public hearing. Councilmember Cashman, would you please put Council Bill 694 on the floor for final passage?Yes, Madam President, I move the Council Bill 21 694 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.Thank you. It has been moved and seconded the required public hearing for council bill 694 is open. May we please have the staff report?Hello. My name is Edson. Iranians, and I'm here before you again with CPD. So before you we have 42 and 95 North Inca Street. Currently it is in a light industrial zone district and they're requesting S.R. eight, which is a residential mixed use.It's located in Council District one, Amanda Sandoval's district, and it is in the Sunnyside neighborhood. As you can see, it's in close proximity to the 31st and Fox Station right at the border there. So the request is just for about an acre site.And it's for urban center neighborhood context, residential mixed use, up to eight storeys in height. And so what this means is that the first level allows for street level retail uses and commercial uses, but the remainder upper stories are strictly reserved for housing and lodging accommodation uses.So the zoning is as you as you can see, it's year or two, which is a light industrial zoning district with the billboard use overlay. So there is no billboard on site and the applicant is looking to remove that you or two adjacent to it, as you can see to the northeast or to but to the westand to the south you can see the same zoned district that the applicant is applying for the CRC, which is a residential mixed use, up to eight storeys as well. Through the West. You see IMAX three, which is an industrial mixed use up to three stories and some UTC, which is a22 unit zone district.The land use is industrial and adjacent to it is an industrial single unit. But as you can see, there's a lot of industrial single unit, multi-unit, residential, vacant office as you can see. And here is a aerial photo of the site.It's about half an acre. And the middle and the bottom for photos are the site itself. As you can see, it's a one story industrial building and directly to the north, above 43rd is the electrical substation. Um, directly to the west, you can see a one storey industrial building and then on the top right photo, it's reallyhard to see, but you can see a one storey industrial building to the south and then about a block and a half away, you see an eight storey S.R., S.R. eight, which is a residential mixed use, up to eight story structure that connects with a pedestrian bridge.So the applicant has entered into a voluntary, affordable housing agreement, which is attached to the staff report of which the applicant is committing to 12.5% of the units as income restricted at 80% or less, ami of which 20% of two or more bedrooms will be income restricted at a 60 year period of affordability.So with the process, it went before the planning board in June and the planning board approved this unanimously. There were some concerns from the planning board. Some of the concerns from the planning board had to do with the 41st and Fox station area plan where it recommends 2 to 8 storeys to like about two blocks to thenorth of this site, saying that at this site it is appropriate for eight storeys, but anything above this site or to the west as when we dove into that plan, that it might not be appropriate for eight stories.That was one of the concerns they had as well as they had some issues around the neighborhood context, which I'm going to explain in a moment. And it is before you today. So far, several different channels have been notified, as you can see on the screen.And there has been one letter of support from the Sunnyside United Neighbors, Sonny's organization, of which Sonny specifies that they met with the applicant in various occasions and they approved it unanimously, and they provided a lot of input on the design and the material of the building.So there are several review criteria that we analyze based off the Denver zoning code. And the first one is consistency with adopted plans. We're looking at four specific plans, which are a comprehensive plan 2040 blueprint in Denver of 2019, the Sunnyside Neighborhood Plan of 1992, and the 41st and Fox Station Area Plan.So there's several strategies found in a comprehensive plan that this application is consistent with. And I will jump into several of these. The first one being under equity, specifically strategy, and B, which is equitable, accessible and inclusive goal one and two, increasing the development of housing units close to transit and mixed use developments, as well as createa greater mix of housing options in every neighborhood for all individuals and families. As well as for climate under the environment, resilient, resilient and gold strategy A, B and C promote infill development where infrastructure and services already in place.Encourage mixed use communities where residents can live, work and play in their own neighborhoods, as well as focus growth by transit stations. Now when we jump into Blueprint, Blueprint classifies this area as general urban. Which homes vary from multi-unit complexes to complex, compact single unit houses and development should offer a mix of uses with good street activationand connectivity, and it should be served by transit and enjoy access to abundant amenities and entertainment options. So something I do want to highlight is that blueprint Denver and tend to emphasize this area with a future neighborhood context of General Urban, the applicant is applying for urban center.So however however that area plan as well as blueprint in the next slide will show that that this location is appropriate for up to eight storeys, but there is no eight storeys in the residential mixed use for the general urban.So that's why the applicant is applying for this urban center. Residential mixed use eight stories. So as you saw earlier in the existing zoning slide and I have it here, there are other rezonings at this location that have the six eight district which is very comparable to the closest groups five in terms of like built to requirementsas well as limitations of parking structures and the pedestrian realm. So Blueprint does provide specific guidance on the flexibility of a neighborhood context, which is found on page 66 of Blueprint, which says a mapping of a neighborhood context is at a citywide scale.So the boundaries of the context may be interpreted with limited flexibility if the request furthers the goals of Blueprint Denver and is consistent with the overall intent of the neighborhood context. And so at this specific application, they are providing affordable housing option, they're promoting comparable design and providing a walkable mixed use center here.And so when we look at the future place type for this site, it it's classified as high medium residential, which offers a mix of low to medium scale multi-unit residential uses with some neighborhood services servicing mixed use distributed throughout.And buildings are generally up to eight storeys in height and block patterns are consistent and pedestrian scaled buildings form clearly define and activate the street now 43rd and industry are on designated local streets and I know that it's not adjacent to a arterial or collector street but the but it is served in that area by light panand 38th, which are arterial collector streets as well as the pedestrian connection that is about a block and a half to the south that connects to the commuter rail. So I also wanted to provide a comparison similar to what's found in the staff report.In the staff report, we do industrial to what this proposes. But I also wanted to show that in Blueprint recommends General Urban and the applicants applying for our urban center because there is no x eight. But when you look at Greece five in comparison to Syria, it's very similar when you look at setbacks.They're identical when you're looking at the stories. They're different in this sense because one is five and eight is what applicants seeking for. But when you look at surface parking between buildings in Primary Street, they're identical. And when you look at the bill two, they're very similar.So these districts are very similar. When we jump into a blueprint for future growth strategy, it's classified as all areas of their city where they're anticipated to see 10% of new job growth and 20% of new housing growth by 2040.And something to highlight is that we're going from an industrial use to a residential mixed use is that this subject site is not in a manufacturing district or a manufacturing preservation area. Now when we jump into the sunny side neighborhood plan, the sunny side identified this area as industrial and it states that the far eastern portion ofthis plan should be industrial. Given that it's it's it's close proximity to the rail as well as the interstate. And then it also says that there's scattered residential mixed in through the industrial and that should be redeveloped as industrial uses.And so so although the Sunnyside Neighborhood Plan was it is an adaptive plan and continues to shape the overall policy and development decisions of the area. There's a newer plan that was adopted in 2009, which is the 41st and Fox station area plan that gives more specific guidance for this area.That station plan is in response to new opportunities presented by the commuter rail. As a result, it provides a substantially different land use recommendation in the Sunnyside Neighborhood Plan, which pre-dates the conception of the fast tracks by more than a decade.And then the 41st and Fox station area plan does not recommend industrial like this plan does. So when we jump into the 41st and Fox station area plan, it provides a vision for a diverse, transit, supportive and environmentally sustainable urban center.And something that I do want to point out is that when you look at the actual plan, this specific site is classified as a electrical substation, which I showed you earlier below and previously, is that the electrical substation is above 43rd, not below 43rd.So there's a mapping error with this. And so the inferred land use for this site is urban residential, 2 to 8 storeys, as you can see. That's what's to the north, to the south, to the west. And so when we're looking at urban residential, it's new moderate density neighborhoods forming a new edge between the station and theexisting neighborhood to the west, as well as it provides a lot of urban design recommendations, such as asking for it to be closer to the street, the building, and to minimize the setbacks. So the proposed S.R. eight zoning meets the land use intensity and design intent of the 41st and Fox station area plan.And when we're jumping into review criteria to uniformly disaggregate nations, the request is consistent as well as furthering the public health safety in general welfare. And it does this by implementing adaptive plans as well as it's furthering the city's goals by creating a cohesive, walkable community around the 41st and FOX Station.And then for the fourth criteria justifying circumstances, the applicant stated change and changing conditions in a particular area in the city in general by this is a mixed use redevelopment in the area and the 41st and Fox commuter station and pedestrian bridge that is in close proximity and the Inca Street multi-use path that connects downtown.And for the fifth graders here, consistent with neighborhood context, is this your purpose and intent? Sierra Zone District Promote safe, active and pedestrian scaled diverse areas through building forums that activate the public realm. Therefore CPD recommends approval based based on all findings that the review has been met.I am available for questions. Andrew Johnson from host is here to answer any questions as well and the applicant is online Billy Wang as well to answer questions.All right. Thank you, Anderson, for the great staff report. And we have one individual signed up to speak this evening, and he's joining us virtually. And we have Jesse Paris.Yes. There's a council of those watching at home. Those are in the council chambers. My name is Jesse with some personal work resume for Blackstone, maximum for self-defense powers of actually come in for social change as well as the unity party of Colorado and frontline black knows and I would be the next my member in 2023.I am against this rezoning tonight for several reasons. The first reason is this is not affordable 80% or less than mine in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood that is not affordable. Maybe if it was 40%. Maybe if it was.50% or less. I would be in favor of it, but I'm not in favor of this. Only 12% of the units are 80% or less. That is definitely not affordable. I have three questions. Is there a traffic study done on this particular site?Has there been a parking study done on this particular sites? And last but not least, has there been a neighborhood agreement at this particular site? How many square feet are these apartments going to be? Now, you say it meets all five of the criteria, which is consistency with adopted plans, uniformity of district regulations, further public health, safetyand welfare, justified circumstances and consistency with neighborhood context and zone sense. This is rapid gentrification. You're going to continue to fuel rapid gentrification if you pass this tonight. This is not affordable by any means. I don't know who you think can afford this, but 80% am I.That means you have to make 80% of $75,000 a year to be able to afford to live in these units. So this is not affordable. Please stop saying this is affordable, but it is clearly not. And don't pass it to me.Thank you.Thank you. That concludes our speakers for this hearing. Questions from members of Council on Council Bill 694. Councilmember Ortega.Thank you, Madam President. I just wanted to ask a couple of questions. Is the applicant around?Yes. I believe we have the applicant in the queue. Billy.Okay. Billy. Wink, I believe. So the first question I want to ask is whether or not the applicant was provided the information from the railroad working group that basically has a check off box on the application to basically alert them that they need to be looking at how they would address railroad safety issues.So to the applicant, did you receive that when you came to the Planning Department?Okay. We're double checking that we have the applicant in the queue.Can you hear me? This is Billy Wang.Very good. Go ahead, please.Good evening, council members. We did not receive a railroad plan. Council woman Ortega. And regarding the traffic study, we were informed that that would be required when we submit prior to the site development plan what we've proposed to SUNY thus far and get their unanimous support from the PC, SUNY Pcdi and the Sunni neighborhood is a conceptualplan that shows the elevation and a concept of units. We don't have those defined in terms of how many units, what's the square footage. But we would be pursuing that. As we progress with design.That said your application was within a close proximity to railroad. Is that what you're saying to me in when you submitted your application?It is. Yes. It's adjacent to the railroad tracks, correct?Did your application check that box.I would have to look.It's an I have a question for you about what the tallest building is along that corridor adjacent to the tracks close to the light rail stop.I may answer that question, but before I do, we did provide them with a railroad study at the Pre-Application phase and as well a few, maybe a few weeks before the planning board as well, because I know this question would be brought up.And this building, if you remember correctly, this is the one where we discussed what previous applicants have done in the past and with noise, TDM and different things of what the plan talked about specifically. And you mentioned about how you wanted to maybe mimic some of that stuff if you remember correctly.But I did send it to you, Billy, on two occasions and we did talk about it Zoom as well. But going by it for your question, I don't know that specific. I do know that it's eight storeys and it's about a block and a half to the south.It's that C development which is eight storeys. I don't know. The height, the maximum height that it is allowed to be is 110. I'm not sure if it's at 110, but the zone district allows for that one, which is exactly this one district to S.R. eight.It would allow for a 110. I'm not sure if it's below that or around that, but it should be around that.Okay. I've driven and I don't remember that any of them were eight stories in in height. And perhaps Councilwoman Sandoval can address that.Yes. The Zia apartment building on 40th and into from 40 from 40th to 41st. The entire block is eight stories currently built and occupied.Okay.And do you know if they addressed the railroad safety concerns in their construction, in their work with the planning department?From what I understand, they met all requirements for building. I don't know specifically if it was the railroad construction because there is the street and then the anchor pedestrian trail, the promenade and then more land and then the rail yard.Okay. Thank you. It's an. Can you tell me if there are any limitations on the first floor activation that you talked about that would happen on this site?The limitations are only if it's strictly residential, but if it's commercial, it's the setbacks can be zero.In terms of the types of uses that could be in the commercial space, that's what I'm referring to.It's mainly focused on retail and commercial uses, not necessarily industrial uses, as you see in Mumbai, but it will be mainly retail and commercial uses office as well.Okay. And then the applicant said he wasn't clear on how many units there might be, but with these stories that potentially can can be pretty significant in terms of the number of units, somewhere in the 70 to 80 ballpark, depending on size, you know, number of bedrooms, etc..So this is trying to get an idea of that given its proximity to rail. Can you just talk about how many parking spaces this would require? Again, knowing that sort of tied to the number of the units that will be on the site.I'm going to let the applicant speak on that because he has a breakdown of parking and the number of units that he's been discussing with House as well as well.Thank you.Billy.Thank you. Can you hear me okay? Yes. So to address your question regarding first, the commercial spot right now from the concept plan, we have allocated commercial space right on the corner of the northeast corner of 43rd and anchor.Alongside that would be a plaza because one of the key components is to activate 43rd and activate anchor and drive as a community center. So we would streetscape that from both angles and create a commercial site. Right now.I believe. Let me look. The concept plans is about 74 units. Councilwoman Ortega But that may adjust and as it adjusts, the affordability scale would adjust as well. Regarding the parking, we would certainly adhere to the parking requirements for that zone district and we would take into the future traffic study plan of trying to minimize parking ortry to minimize. The number of use of cars. Along that well and try to promote the the fox and 41st light rail plan, car sharing, smart cars etc..So tied to that question. Have have you ever encountered a bank being concerned that if you didn't provide adequate parking, that if for some reason the project didn't move forward, they didn't want to be stuck with the project.They couldn't park the units.I have not personally encountered that.Q I have no further questions. All right.Thank you, Councilmember Ortega. Up next, we have council member Flynn.Thank you, Madam President. Hudson, I have one quick question. I recall from I think I recall correctly from a long ago billboard overlay issue that here we're getting rid of the overlay is our is the city under any obligation to maintain a certain amount of billboard overlay areas in the city.Is there some sort of an agreement still in effect? And, Nate, I don't know if you can answer that. I do. It was a long time ago. I remember this came up in a hearing. I just wonder what the current status is.Not that I want to see billboards here. Good evening. Members of council.Neighbors their assistant city attorney. There is no obligation for the city to maintain the billboard use overlay.Okay. So conceivably, if we re zoned any place with a billboard overlay we could do away with. We're under no obligation to keep. That is correct. Okay. Thank you. Could I ask, is there someone here from host? Oh, Andrew, I forgot.You're over and hosts now. Thank you. Hello. Andrew Johnson with the Department of Housing. Could you raise the microphones here to Andrew Johnson with the Department of Housing Stability? Thank you. In the affordable housing agreement, it read. It has two alternative paragraphs if they're for rent or for sale, but they seem to require the same thing.Can you describe, first of all, do we know what the owner intends to do, what the developer intends to do here? Yeah. His intent is actually to do rental to the rental. And so the focus during our conversations when we were going through this agreement was to do rentals.We always put up for sale paragraph in there as much as possible just in case, because 60 years is a long time. It could change somewhere down the road just in case it goes condo. Correct. Okay. I would we normally have this ask for the same percentages and affordability levels between a rental project and a for saleproject. Just because of a different economics.We usually have different AMI levels on a for sale sign.Right. We did talk about a different percentage on the for sale side.But because was very confident that he was doing.Rental just focused on the just the rental AMI level. Okay. Thank you, Madam President. That's all I had.Thank you, Councilmember Flynn. And thank you, Andrew. Up next, we have Councilman Cashman.Thank you, Madam President. For the owner or developer. I'm wondering, you said 74 units. Was we talking the whole development or the affordable portion?A. Can you hear me? Hello?Yes, we can hear. Okay.I apologize. The 74 units is in concept right now. That's total number of units. So if we were to meet the agreed host agreement of 12 and a half percent, what would that be? Nine units, approximately eight or nine units, and then 20% of 74, which would be two units.I think 20%, 20 for me.Total units, not of the affordable units.Just 274 is the total number of units in concept right now. Yes.12.5% of that is going to be affordable at 80%. So 20%, two bedrooms, 20% of, what, 20? And it's got to be 20% of the 12 and a half percent. Correct.It'll be about.One one or two units.Yes. Okay.So it's a lot of math, but it's about one or two.Units in back.All right, I. You're all brave doing math on the spot. So I was just going to let you go ahead and do that. Thank you, Councilman Cashman. And thank you, Andrew, for helping out with those questions. All right.Seen no other members of council in the queue. The public hearing is closed. Comments from members of Council on Council Bill 694 Council Member Sandoval.Thank you, Madam President. I know that the applicant, Billy Wing, has worked with the Sunnyside neighborhood to get their support as it was just brought up by my colleague. I wish the affordability was going deeper. 1 to 2 units does not make a dent into the Sunnyside neighborhood.But that's another day, another story for another day. I know that my colleague, Councilwoman Kenny and I are sitting on the expanding affordable housing task force, which hopefully we will get more units out of rezonings such as these.So with that, I ask my colleagues support. Thank you.All right. Thank you. Councilmember Sandoval and seen no other speakers. I will go ahead and chime in that I do believe that this has met all of the review criteria and will be voting in favor of this tonight.And I want to also let folks know that Councilman Hines needed to leave the meeting.

Proclamation 241 Series of 2018 in support of National Native HIV AIDS Awareness Day and National Women and Girls. H i. V AIDS Awareness Day. Whereas more than 1.2 Americans are living with HIV and more than 50,000 become and become infected with HIV every year.One in four are between the ages of 13 and 24. Female youth accounted for nearly 2000 of all youth living with HIV. And. Whereas, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment at the end of 2015, more than 13,000 people were reported to be living with HIV in the state of Colorado.And. Whereas, HIV and AIDS has affected the city and county of Denver more than any other area in the state of Colorado reporting the most persons living with the disease, most HIV or AIDS related deaths, and 36% of HIV infections in 2015.Excuse me. And. WHEREAS, the continued spread of HIV in the American Indian and Alaska Native communities poses a significant risk to the public health and well-being of these communities. They've had the third highest rate of new HIV infections in Colorado from 2011 to 2015.And. WHEREAS, when compared to other ethnic groups, American Indians and Alaskan natives are ranked fifth in estimated rates rates of HIV diagnoses and have poorer survival rates after an HIV diagnosis. HIV infection was the ninth leading cause of death among American Indian and Alaska Native youth, aged 25 to 34 in 2014.And. WHEREAS, American Indian and Alaska Natives also have one of the lowest awareness rates. One in five who live with HIV are unaware of their status, causing them to go without treatment and may unknowingly pass the disease onto others.And. WHEREAS, approximately one in four people living with HIV in the US are women, cases disproportionately affect African-American and Latino women, who represent 29% of all women in the U.S., but account for 78% of HIV cases among women.And.

United for Education.Thank you. Councilman Lopez, your motion to adopt.Thank you, Mr. President. I moved that proclamation to 41 series of 2018 be adopted.It has been moved and seconded comments by members of Council Councilman Lopez.Thank you, Mr. President. I I think it was five years ago where we first had this proclamation, and it was it was imperative that we read this, and it was imperative because we have to get the word out in our communities.It's not although this this proclamation is geared and specifically towards national native HIV, HIV AIDS Awareness Day and National Women and girls, HIV AIDS Awareness Day. It it really is a message for everybody. Right. It does not discriminate.And the more education that we have in our community, the best that we can actually prepare for it, educate our communities, understand how to prevent the spread of HIV and AIDS, and know that there is testing. There's free testing.A lot of folks, just the first the just the walking in the clinic is scary enough. Being able to ask the questions is scary enough, making that easy in our community, making it a conversation that people can have in the community in so many different languages, but especially especially in the native and indigenous community.Right. And so I you know, I can go on and on. We all you know, we've made some progress in the country. We made some progress in the world. But it's just not. It's not enough. And that's why we have to make sure that we have proclamations like this, that the message is spread throughout our communities andto really honor the people that do this on a day to day basis. Right. Those folks who are in our community, in the grassroots. And there's going to be some individuals that can speak a lot better than I can on this.And I do want to bring them up after we have our. I mean, I support this absolutely whole heartedly. Happy to sponsor this. I know we have some co-sponsors on this that that you'll see. I know. Maybe speak up and ask my colleagues to support this with me.And let's brings these speakers up.Thank you, Councilman Lopez.Councilman Flynn figures for president. I would like Secretary to have my name as a sponsor. I didn't get back in time last week to put my name on this, but I would like it on. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Flynn. And thank you, Councilman Lopez, for bringing this forward. Madam Secretary, roll call.LOPEZ All right.New assessment. Black Eye. Espinosa, I. Flynn. I. Gilmore. Herndon. Cashman.Can each.Mr. President.Please close the voting and announce the results?Sorry. Whoops.Sorry.And you know I mean this president when.11 Eyes.11 eyes proclamation to 41 has been adopted. Guzman-Lopez. Is there someone you would like to invite up to receive the proclamation?Yes, absolutely. So there's Joy Lynch and Brenda Negrete, then the Youth Council members of a café called Dura and anybody. So if you want to come up. Introduce yourselves and your words. And then. Just the council. If you want to ask anybody up to come up, you're welcome as well to.Yet they shared Joy Lynch in a snap to cheat in a nurse that not Ginny Stein has klipsch need ascertained Beth login into Hello, my name is Joy. I'm 17 years old and I'm currently a senior at East High School.What what really stood out to me in this situation was the is just native women as a native woman. You know, I come from a tribe that's mostly matriarchal. So I understand the importance of my being the importance of being a woman.And, you know, just to protect yourself spiritually, mentally and physically, you know, that's what really stuck out to me. And just the idea that, you know, we need this awareness. This isn't our conversation that happens in our communities a lot.This isn't a conversation that I have a lot, you know. So just having the National Native HIV Awareness Day, as well as the National Women and Girls HIV AIDS Awareness Day, is such a such a relief. And I'm so grateful to have this opportunity to speak in front of you.And I'm so grateful that you guys were here to support this proclamation as you head. Hi. I'm Brendan Margaret. I'm a senior at early college Ramada, and I wrote a little something just to show my feelings towards the situation and how important it is to have these acknowledgments of these concerns in our communities and to be spokenabout. So. I mean, de la la salud de la muerte. Spinning the pendulum between my fingers and feeling my face turning bright red while the boy in the back of the classroom continues to speak about how nice my breasts look with my new bra.Yet not understanding the original use of my breasts rather than being here for the older men in the corner of the streets to ogle over my hormones hovering in the air while the teacher at the front of the room says, Young women never have sex, never understand these concepts, and if they do, they will be an outcast. But she failed to tell me that the truth powers in my body. Her true powers with my emotions and energies seeing to know about your body and to love it is one of the most beautiful things that could happen.How am I supposed to know about my body when you sweep it under the table like dirt floating around in the air and sweeping a low, hushed voice to settle the dust, as you have tried to settle my calls for help.How are we supposed to keep silent when 77% of Latino women go through workplace sexual harassment? Native women are three times more likely to be sexually abused in their lifetimes when more than one in four trans women are living with HIV.When the HIV diagnosis among African-American women fell 20%, but it's still at the highest compared to other races and ethnicities. They keep our knowledge and ways away from us, slowly depriving of our self-love and care in order to keep the hierarchy up and keep us down.But as we hold our hands together, bloody and torn, hearing the whispers of our ancestors, we slowly remember. Once we acknowledge these ways, we will use the dirt swept under the table and plant a bright red flower so pure that even we will get the recognition one day.Thank you so much. Councilman Lopez, did you want to jump back in for a second?Yeah, I forgot to introduce. This is my college buddy, Manny. He's going to give me a scolding, but I forgot to bring out our crews as the director of Cafe called to the to the to the microphone. And I just wanted to say something.Those two young women want the ones about to graduate in. Graduate, right. So what are you gonna do? What college are you going to go? I don't know. We got you on the record. You're going to get you're going to go to college, right?All right. That's on the record. Anyway, I just wanted to keep it. That was beautiful. And if, Mr. President, we can have our crews come. Q Thank you, Paul.So as Paul has mentioned, we've done this several times and it's always a good thing to come here and and bring this awareness. We have an event this coming Friday. It's called Rise Up. It's a free.Event, free food, free HIV STI.And Hep C testing. We're partnering with Sisters, of course, United for Education. As was mentioned, Chip, the Children's Children's Hospital Immunodeficiency Program, as well as Servicios de la Raza, a bunch of other organizations.And so last year we, I think, tested close to 60 to 65 people. And we actually.Had one person who was tested positive and was able to get the kind of services that they needed and support and that direction. So in actually the first year that we had this event, a young man, 18 years old, found out he was HIV positive.So it was it was good for him to be able to have that knowledge and be able to get the resources that he needs.So I would encourage you on this Friday.6:30 p.m. at the.Althea Center, we're going to have a singer.Rapper from California named Jessica Calderon, indigenous hip hop artist, as well as Native Maxim magazine, doing a fashion show. And so I encourage people to attend.

I remember pulling this item about a month ago and had questions. And I want to thank Craig Beck for depicting all of the the information that will are all of the details as to what this contract will cover.However, I did have one question relative to the security, because I know City Place has been in an issue historically with security. So can you tell me a little bit about what that will cover and entail? Exactly.Craig.Certainly Councilmember Gonzales, members of the council, the item that you have before you is really focused on the operating side of our parking lots, not so much the CHP elements, which we we do have a number of those coming forward.But we felt it was prudent to make a reinvestment in many of our facilities, especially the city place garage in the downtown. And we've added a number of security personnel and security hours over the course of 24 seven operation in City Place alone, we've added over 160 hours of security time.Plus under this agreement with central parking who are now ESP plus they put in somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 additional security cameras in that garage, which are now monitored by the security officers. So we've really tried to step up that experience.There's also increased maintenance, power washing. We've increased the frequency of power washing in those garages where we have a number of other items that we're going to be addressing moving forward.

To be placed upon final consideration and to pass.It has been. Okay. It's been moved and seconded. Public hearing 570 is now open. Andrew.You're on. Good evening. My name is Andrew Johnson. I'm with the Department of Finance here to give you the staff report on a new Metropolitan District Service Plan. Council Bill 570 series of 2018 is for an ordinance to approve a service plan for a new metropolitan district titled Boulevard at Lowry Metropolitan District.The service plan is being submitted for City Council approval on behalf of C K Lowry, one LLC, pursuant to the requirements of the Special District Act, Sections 32, Dash one, Dash 201 and more particularly 32. Dash one. Dash two a 4.5.The initial project and future inclusion area to be affected by the proposed metropolitan district consists of about 5.39 acres, generally located near First and Quebec avenues. Together, the areas are referred to as the service area. The district will not provide duplicative public services or improvements that are already being provided by other municipal organizations.The new Metropolitan District will be responsible for coordinating the financing, acquisition, construction, completion operation and maintenance of all public infrastructure and services within and without the service area, including without limitation all streets, safety, water, sewer, storm, drainage, transportation and park and recreation facilities.The district will have the power to raise revenues pursuant to the authorities granted by the special the Special District Act, including the imposition of up to 30 mills plus rates, fees, tolls and charges. The total estimated cost of the public improvements necessary to serve the initial development are approximately 15 million.In order for the district to have the fiscal wherewithal to provide the funding for the upfront costs and the public improve as needed in the service area, the district shall have the ability to issue debt and impose a mill levy for a term not to exceed 40 years.The proceeds of the debt issuance will provide funding for the upfront infrastructure costs. The district will also have the ability to oppose up to ten of the 30 mills authorized to raise revenue for operations and maintenance of the district improvements.The site is intended to support only commercial uses, including a Lucky's grocery store offices, retail and restaurant land uses. The district will be responsible for ongoing maintenance of public enhancements on the commercial site, including lighting planters and a parking garage to serve the businesses, as well as have additional parking for the Selectman Library, which is adjacent tothe site. The site is part of the final Lowry Air Force Base redevelopment, commonly known as Boulevard one. Approval of the service plan establishes the following. There is sufficient existing and projected need for the organized service in the area.Existing service in the area is inadequate for the president and projected needs. The district is capable of economically providing sufficient service to the area within the proposed boundaries. The land and proposed development to be included does and will have the financial ability to discharge the proposed indebtedness on a reasonable basis.The facility and service standards will be compatible with the facility and service standards of the city. City staff does recommend approval of this service plan. Tonight, we also have here the applicant and other folks supporting the creation of this district for your questions and answers.All right. Thank you. All right. We have. Looks like we have five speakers this evening. Please come to the front. I think you're all are up to the front. Bruce O'Donnell, your first.Thank you, Mr. President. I'm Bruce O'Donnell, 386 Emerson Street in Denver.

Thank you, Chairman Sekou.My name is Terrence Sekou. Founder, organizer for the Black Star Action Movement for Self-defense, servicing poor, working, poor, homeless youth and senior citizens throughout city and county of Denver. These metropolitan districts. A very, very serious composition of the folks who are doing this speaks to the code of conduct and the manner in which this thing is goingto happen. And while I support the creation of this district. I will employ the folks that are organizing this thing in our part of this thing to make sure that whatever you're doing out there with the comes of housing, which we need to know, is it affordable or is it price where regular folks can't afford it?It on my watch? Is am I on this? How much money do you have to be in this? How much money you go excluded in this as you go about all this development and raising new taxes and all of that?Where do we fit in at that? Do we fit in where it comes to getting contracts to do this thing? Are we going to even be allowed to hold a sign? I'm talking about black people. Because when I go to all these metropolitan digs, you see all this construction stuff.Black people. Absolutely. There's brown this white. There's women. No black people. They, like, disappeared, like the Indians. And now we have museum pieces and relics and even historical designs again. This is where the Negroes used to be. Kind of like how you're treating the Indians on reservations in the four corners.See? These unintended consequences that are divided by serious questions, like ask them how much housing you're going to do, what's the price of is going to be rent? Is it going to be homeownership? How do you have a program for poor people to come up in this?Is there black contractors? Duane is going to be a part of this. Are we going to let this slide back? And slowly but surely, the black population disappears. And then. Yeah. Now, where is it? Scattered to the winds.No more political base, but. But to operate and have even the possibility of exercising power because you split it up into a million pieces. And you keep that. And the people who are doing this are okay with that.Look at what's there. You see any diversity, any of this? Do you know what's going to happen? Elliot. You do it every time. You know what I hear? Well, you know, they call you right into the da da da da da da da da.Yeah, I'm with you on that. But was the gate everything you said and you're talking out of both sides of your neck, but you still you voted for things that you never thought, but you've got a way of explaining it cause it looked good on television.So you can try to fool the voters, but you can fool some of the people some of the time. But you can't fool everybody all the time.Mr. Speaker. Stay on task with the metropolitan district.So with this metropolitan district as you go. And thank you very much for keeping on task. I appreciate that. So this metropolitan district. Has to be seriously examined in terms of intent, not what they say. Asking about the track record.Well, even do they include black folk in this, including poor people in this, where they add in you and your and your operating folks in your broke, in your poor, you've got an experience of being broke. No. And your voice is never in the room when decisions are made.It sort of goes on and on and on. At all. So after 65 years. Being born and raised in this city and actually being a busboy at the Lowry Officers Club when I was 16 years old, waiting on a white officer.Because they wouldn't allow black officers to come into the club massacre. So here we go, transforming that legacy into something new and different that is fundamentally representative of 21st century mores. We need to be included and we're counting on you all to make sure that we're doing that by being the oversight board for this mess.We want you vote. You let it go and let it do what it do. And you waiting for folks to come in and to ask for help. But too today. So when we talk about celebrating the fire thing, we brought the women in there, the first responders to the city.Well, you are first responders. You're on line. And when they get through you, is that young quarterback, said Jack. And we keep falling backward and backward and backward and backward and backward and backward and backward. While you sit there and you cheer.For how the West is one at the exclusion extermination of others other than white. Keep on pushing, keep on doing what you're doing. Martin Luther King said there's a more arc in the universe. I guarantee you God is watching and they're not going.All right. This concludes the public hearing for I actually I'm sorry. Questions by members of council. Councilman Marty.I have a couple of questions. The first one is for Andrew, if you would mind, coming forward. Does the city have a policy on the size of a metro district? So somebody came in with one acre. Would we?Improvement district. Is there a limit on the size?We do have a criteria that we set out back in 2004 when we had a lots of green space. It was shortly after. If you think about all the land around Panya Boulevard that was annexed and we did have a criteria of about 160 acres was the size that we chose that we would do nothing smaller than160 acres. But as all the large plazas have been filled up, we have routinely looked at smaller and smaller infill sites for metropolitan districts to be utilized.So do we have a limit on the on the lower end?If it if it makes sense that it's fulfilling, we look at it more holistically and look to it to like do the visioning. But no, we don't have a girlfriend.Okay. And I don't know if you're the one that should answer the next question. So I heard that they're looking to do a grocery. But what what else is intended to be included within this development besides grocery stores?Is that intended to take up the majority of the five acres, 5.39 acres.So Robert Koonce with the development entity. And so this will be a mixed use block with multi stories.Primarily retail and restaurants on the ground floor and offices and other commercial uses on the upper two and three stories.And there is no housing.And there's no housing on this block.Okay. Do does the developer propose to use tax increment financing? Is that something that you're looking at down the road or.So this is a site that's in the Lowry redevelopment area. So it is in the Lowry tax increment finance area already. It is already in a tax increment area. So there is tax increment money that has been used to help get the site ready.Okay. So that's already been utilized?Yes. But the tax increment finance area has expired. And so all the original taxing revenues are returning now to the original taxing entities.Okay.Great. Thank you. I have no further questions.All right. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Espinosa.So the 25 year period for new projects is it is no longer possible to introduce a new project.So the new projects. When the Lowry Redevelopment Project was originally a vision, there were a lot of projects that were brought forward. That list of projects has been completed and there are the tax increment finance area has been closed and so there are no more.I was retired early ahead of schedule.So I'm sure this you've already talked about this in in committee and I'm sorry to go over this, but I'm looking at this. And aside from sort of one little segment of of underground sewer, it looks like pretty much all the infrastructure is there in the surrounding streets and the grid has been laid out and whatnot.And it seems like the improvements are largely focused on on private property, you know? You know, we had just gotten done talking about the stadium and I expect a parking structure to be in the stadium because that's a function that the that we've already put public investment into.What is what's the impetus here? What is what makes this block different than any other private block in this city that requires there?That's I mean, that's a good question. And when you look at the Lowry redevelopment as a whole, it's that's how you got to look at the tax increment on this one, because it was an old Air Force base and then it was it by the utilization of the tax increment financing tool, we used the incremental property taxesto help redo replan, plan this, revision it and actually implement certain pieces of public infrastructure to bring that vision to fruition, whether it be some of the parks or the roads to actually get that was the use of the tax increment.If there was, there is $3.5 million of tax increment going towards this particular project and it is to help create the parking, which is is part of the support for the library because the library doesn't have enough parking right now.So when you look at like all the visioning and all the things that are going on across. LOWRY This is just that final piece of it.So there is going to be a shared parking arrangement with the library across the street.Yes. Okay. All right. Thank you.You're welcome. All right. Thank you for those questions. Members of council. This concludes the public hearing for 570 comments of members of council and some assessment.This is so it's so interesting to me because it's one of the last of a very long project. I started on the Lowry Project in 1992, two years before the airbase closed. And if you can imagine, you know, thousands of acres and more in the middle of the city and what a hubbub it caused at the time. And this was an area, the boulevard, one that we didn't even expect to have the Air Force surplus. And so it came at the very end. It was the Finance Center. This particular plan for the Project for Boulevard One was done with a large committee of of residents of Lowry and neighbors.And it was well discussed. And certainly the part about having a commercial area that was across the street from the Lowry Town Center was important to the design. And, um, and here we are with a metropolitan district, and certainly we're very happy about the sharing with the shuttle's replacement library.And of course, we are the bond is going to increase the size of the library. And so the need for the parking is even more than we had expected. Very glad to have the grocery store. And very sort of wistful about this being the last project of Lowry's.Since I've been working on it for quite a while, but it certainly has been a very successful operation thanks to hundreds of people in the community and everybody working on LOWRY. So I urge my fellow council members to vote for this.Thank you.All right. Thank you, Dr. Sussman. Seeing no other comments. Madam Secretary, roll call.SUSSMAN My black eye.CLARK All right. Espinosa.

In December 2014, City Council selected plenary to construct, operate and maintain the new Civic Center plenary is is in the best position topurchase install the identify technology infrastructure that did the design equipment costs were and equipment costs were extensively evaluated by a team of construction, engineering, design and technology consultants to ensure the solutions were consistent with the Civic Center design and were competitively priced.The need for plenary to provide these foundational systems was identified and included in the equipment category of the critical technology infrastructure needs. Presentation to the City Council on December 5th, 2017. The the source of the Civic Center technology costs of $7 million is is the proceeds of lease purchase financing for term of up to 15 years.The annual estimated lease payments and lifecycle costs of 1.1.8 $9 million will be recovered from client operations or client departments via the Technology MRU.

Councilmember Hines, will you please put Council Bill 22, dash zero zero for four on the floor for final passage?My pleasure. I move that constable 20 2-004 for be placed upon final consideration and do pass.It has been moved and seconded the required public hearing for Council Bill 20 2-0044 is open. May we have the staff report? I really.Just a minute.Okay. Go ahead and introduce yourself.I'm Libby Adams with Community Planning and Development, and I will be presenting the MAP Amendment at 3178 South Dayton Court as soon as the PowerPoint opens. Okay. So this application is located in Council District four in the Hamden neighborhood, and the applicant is requesting to rezone from suburban single unit F to Suburban Single Unit F with waiversto allow for an accessory dwelling unit. The applicant has proposed waivers to allow the aid to use the detached edu building form and then to waive the minimum zone. Lot depth of 150 feet. As stated previously, the property is currently zoned SNCF, which allows the suburban house building form on a minimum zone.Lot size of 8500 square feet. This site is currently occupied by a single unit home with single unit and park uses surrounding the site. This slide shows the existing building form and scale with the subject property on the upper right hand side.Then a postcard notifying neighboring property owners within 200 feet of the site was sent out on October 19th. Planning Board unanimously recommended approval on January 5th of this year. And to date, staff has not received any public comment.The Denver zoning code has five review criteria that must be met in order for a rezoning to be approved. The first criterion is consistency with adopted plans. This rezoning will meet several of the strategies and comprehensive plan 2040, including creating a greater mix of housing options in all neighborhoods and promoting infill development where there's already services andinfrastructure in place. And then in Blueprint Denver this the neighborhood context is classified as suburban. These areas are a range of uses from single uses to commercial corridors, and then block patterns are generally irregular with curvilinear streets. And Blueprint identifies this property as the low residential place type, and these place types are mostly single unit residential useson larger lots and accessory dwelling units are appropriate. And then both South Dayton and Dartmouth Place are local streets, which are mostly characterized by residential uses. The Growth Area Strategy and blueprint. Denver is all other areas of the city.This is where we anticipate to see 10% of new jobs and 20% of new housing by 2040. And then blueprint also includes specific policy recommendations. So land use and vote form housing policy for strategy states that individual rezonings to allow AIDS are appropriate and should be small and area.And then Blueprint Policy five discusses removing barriers to constructing use and then Blueprint also has guidance for when to use waiver. So it recommends limiting the limiting the use of customized zoning tools like waivers to unique and extraordinary circumstances.So customized zoning tools are most effective when a standard zoned district does not exist to implement our adopted plans. So CPD uses waivers in situations where the waivers help solve an issue the department is committed to resolve through a future text amendment.So, as seen on the previous slide blueprint, Denver recommends removing barriers to Adus through a text amendment. Until those changes are made, it's appropriate to consider individual rezonings to allow adus and the suburban context currently has a limit has limited adu district options.So this waiver is a bridge to a district that will be created with the ADU Use and Denver project. And so staff believes this is an appropriate circumstance to use a customized zoning approach. Staff also finds the requested zoning meets the next two criteria.It will result in uniformity of district regulations and will further the public health, safety and welfare by providing a new type of housing in a largely single unit area. And then blueprint serves as the justifying circumstance for this rezoning in its recommendation to allow to use in all residential areas.And lastly, the proposed rezoning is consistent with the suburban neighborhood context, the residential districts and the specific intent of the SUV Zone district. So based on finding all five review criteria, have the net staff does recommend approval. And that concludes my presentation.Thank you, Livy. We have one individual signed up to speak this evening. Jesse Paris is joining us online.You're ready? Yes. Good evening. Members of Council for Black Star. Can you hear me? My name is just a the person I'm a present for. Black Star salute a self defense positive actually come in for social change as well as the Unity Party of Colorado and East Denver Residents Council and front line black males.And I'll be the next November 2023. I'm in favor of this rezoning to make it meets all five of the criteria. Consistency what adopt the plans uniformity of district regulations for this public health, safety and wellness. Justifying circumstances and consistency with neighborhood context and so district purpose.And since I'm in favor of rezoning, I just wanted to know what this idea was going to be used for so I could please answer that question. I would really greatly appreciate it. Thank you.Council on Council Bill 22, Dash 004 for Councilwoman Black.Thank you, Madam Pro Tempore. Thank you, Libby. You just said something at the end, which is contrary to something that I believe. So you referred to the ADA in Denver Advisory Committee. And you said something about that committee making a recommendation about changing the zoning for ADAS.And it's my understanding that's not what that committee is doing.That's yeah, I won't change the zoning. My understanding and we do have Josh Palmeri is here from the Eighties and Denver project, but that one of the potentials is that more adu districts may be created, people will have to rezone into them.But I think the the creation of new districts.Okay, good. I just wanted to clarify that. Um, so. This is an interesting application in a very suburban neighborhood. If you look at it on a map like every street is a dead end and there's paths and park.And it's a it's a lovely neighborhood, but I have concerns about the building form. And I know that I've talked to you about this before, but this house is a single story and it's surrounded by one story. Houses, potentially someone could build a two story house five feet from the back fence.Is that correct? Correct. And I think that was really my only question for now, all that my fellow council members asked questions and then I'll probably get back in the queue. Okay, thanks.Next in the queue, Councilman Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. Pro tem. My questions are about in the application. It makes reference to 150 feet. Is that the that lot depth on the frontage of the property?So that would be the depth from the street frontage to the rear and that. So we only have one ADU district in the suburban neighborhood context and it requires a lot depth of 150 feet. And so that's why that's waived because the waivers point to the form standards for RSU F one.Okay. So looking at the photographs of the homes in the neighborhood, it looks like there's a very long set back in the front of these properties. Is that consistent throughout the block?Yes, I would say so.Okay. So then how much space does that leave in the back for an end to you, given the fact that part of the law is already taken up by a front yard excuse me? And then it has a single family home, and now we're talking about putting a unit in the back.So I'm just trying to understand how much of that 11,900 square feet is actually available for construction of a another single family home? And is there a limitation on the size that it can be?Yes. So there is a limitation on the size as far as the actual square footage that would be in the backyard that could be taken up for you. And I don't know the exact numbers for that. I do know it needs to be in the back 35% of the lot.And given this lot size of 11,900 square feet, you know, I would imagine that that still leaves a general. I know that this particular applicant has already worked with development services on the site plan.And so does the developer, the homeowner available to answer any of the questions.That Gavin built.Gavin Belt Pldt. Nope. He's not online. Okay. So nobody's here representing the applicant. They're just letting you all present it to us without being available to answer any questions. That's unfortunate. Okay. Is this an HOA community?I did not know that, Councilman. No, she's.Okay. So we wouldn't have any of those e2e restrictions that they have to deal with. I think those are my only questions. So. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Flynn.Thank you, madam president. Pro tem Libi the you mentioned that in blueprint rezonings for Haiti use are appropriate, particularly when a text amendment may be in the offing. You mentioned Josh is in the audience. Josh, could you come up and take a couple of questions pertinent to this application?Because I'm very concerned about the prospect that a vote on this tonight by this body might prejudice the outcome or predetermine or dictate an outcome for a process that hasn't even started. So when when is your first meeting?Is it's this Thursday. Yeah. Good afternoon. Council Josh Omari, senior city planner, CPD. Thank you. Yes.As Councilwoman Black alluded to earlier in.The meeting, our first meeting is this Thursday, this evening. I'm sorry, could you speak a little more into the mic for me? Yeah, thank you. Yeah. I also would not want to speculate on that process and what the outcome might be.We are kicking off this Thursday. It will be ideally a one year process. And so we'll be back for you guys and adoption.In early 23. But without knowing, you know, kicking off the process, having the discussions, we're not sure what building form will end up with.Josh, could you tell us what what is the full scope of the project? What are the areas they will look at? Are there any areas they will not look at? Yeah, certainly. So we are implementing land use recommendation five from Blueprint Denver, which is tasked with removing barriers to a new construction.So not only looking at what zoning regulations are getting in the way of construction issues, but also building context sensitive form standards. And so currently the ADA standards are the same. Citywide, you can do.A 24 foot all edu.Building form throughout the city. Mm hmm. And so we know that potentially that it doesn't match with all of our other contexts. And so we're going to look really closely at suburban context neighborhoods and figure out what the setbacks should be there, what the height should be, etc., etc..Okay. And as I think that Councilwoman Black brought up the this application, if this lot in question 3178 South the court if it were 25 feet deeper, this would be a straightforward application reason to assess. You have one presumably correct?Or maybe Libby is more. No, I think everyone still allows the tandem house form in this district, so it's unique in that sense. This application waves the tandem house. Correct. Yeah. So we would also we would want to waive that and I think as well, if this was the straightforward Adu rezoning.Correct. Libby, is that the other waiver? Is there waiving the the tandem house?So we're not we're only waiving in the 80 you use for the tandem house will not be allowed. But that isn't allowed. Use and building form in the SCAF one.Correct. Okay. So we're not we're we're just doing a waiver. This is on. Yeah.Yeah.You're using by waiving. Yes.Yeah. The context here is is on is difficult for some people to grasp because usually a waiver means you're giving up something. And here we're using a waiver to give or.We're waiving here. And so the tandem house is not permitted in these waivers.Right. Okay. And Josh, how many how many meetings do you anticipate this group to have? I think there were going to be for now we have seven meetings guaranteed and room for an eighth meeting just in case if we need to really hash out some of these details.So eight meetings throughout the year. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Pro-Tem.Thank you, Councilman Hines.Thank you, President Pro tem. So there are five criteria with which we should make our decision, correct? Correct. Then only those criteria. Nothing else? Correct. So if someone were to ask you, I'd like to know what the area will be used for.Kim, is that a question that we can use the answer to shape our decision?Well.Thank you. Thank you, Madam President. Pro tem.Okay. Thank you, Councilwoman Sandoval.Thank you, ma'am. President pro tem. Um. Thank you, Libby. Thank you, Josh. A couple of questions. When the application came in to CPD, did the applicant come up with the idea for waivers, or was this a collaboration with CPD and the applicant?Yeah, I would say it was a it would be a collaboration just because when they came in, they said they wanted an EDU. And we currently don't have a district that will allow them to have what they wanted, which is a detached adu.And so that's where the collaboration and looking at CPD policy and a waiver might be the best fit at this time.And how was the decision made to waive that? So if you went to a standards and district with a that allows accessory dwelling, does it automatically allow a tandem house form as well?So the SDF one is the only one that also allows the tandem house building form.And that's the zone district that's closest to this area.Correct? That's the only district within the suburban neighborhood context that currently allows the 82 use and building form. So it also allows that tandem house building form.Okay. And have there been? Outreach to the neighbors. Have you heard anything from the neighbors on this application?I have not heard anything from the neighbors. In the applicant's narrative, he did say that he reached out to the registered neighborhood organizations, and I believe he did speak to his neighbors. I have not received any comments.So in these areas that have this suburban form and usually that means that they don't have alleys. I have some areas in inspiration point that have don't have alleys and they usually are not your traditional rectangles or not.They're probably a little bit different. How do these building building firms, such as an accessory dwelling unit, do? Have we looked at any of the unintended consequences of building an accessory dwelling unit with standards that are meant for more of a probably, I don't know, like the one we just did, the urban town, the form in northwestDenver, where it's predominantly a rectangle zone. It's deeper, meaning they get it's the front zone on the front light for the public, for the front lot is smaller and it goes deeper in the back and you have alley access.Even if you don't have the access, I don't have the access and I live in as an urban zone, but I do have still that traditional rectangle zone. Have we looked at unintended consequences and how these building firms actually exist in the built environment?Because I think that's something that is important and that's why we have this edu task force is looking at these unintended consequences of trying to fit a circle into a square peg.Mm hmm. Yeah. So, I mean, my answer to your question was, yeah, that's why we have the AIDS in Denver project. And I would also say that these waivers, they point to the as you F-1 standards. And so if those get changed based on the aid use in Denver project, this law will still have to comply withthat. So it doesn't point to specific like it has to be five feet from the property line so say that you use in Denver project does come up with a different step back from the rear this project would have this development would have to follow that if it's done after that project.And remind me when my last question in that zone district, can you go 2.5 stories as well with that other how high can you go? It's 24 feet.24 feet over the primary. So we have the primary is two and a half storeys across the whole zone lot.Okay. And then the health talk in the Adobe, the detached 24 feet.So 30 to 35 feet for the primary, depending on width across the whole zoned lot and then 24 feet for the adu.Okay. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Cashman.Yeah, thank you, Madam President. Pro tem. Let me just more direct this planning. Think it makes sense? To zone a 24 foot structure five feet from a back property line. With this, with this project, the edu project, beginning with that being acknowledged as a problem area, I'm mystified how we get a recommendation to do that.Yeah. You know, I think we we have guidance that says 80 users should be permitted in all of our residential areas and we have applicants that are coming forward. And so I think, you know, we we kind of have to work with the standards that we have.And so we have this guidance that says 80 you should be permitted here from our in our plans. And so I think that's why we did this waiver. And I think that's why we did the waiver the way we did.Because, like I said, if you know the applicant, sometimes these processes take time to actually develop. And so if the views and project comes in with something different and changes the text, then this will still be subject to that change because it just points to the standards.And so, you know, Josh's project here could change what the actual ADA will look like on the site.Okay. Thank you for your answer.Thank you. And Councilwoman Black.Thank you. Along those same lines, did you guys consider halting these in suburban sound districts until after this process?Yeah. So my understanding is that I don't think CPD has the authority to. Stop projects to do a moratorium on use in urban context. But that could be in the question.You know, that makes sense for, you know, can you commit to that piece? Hi, Nate.I sincerely believe that members of Council, Navy Services and City Attorney, Councilwoman Black, can I have your repeated questions as I have a little trouble hearing?So we were wondering if CPD considered not. Supporting these applications in suburban zone districts until after the advisory committee some of its work so just. A temporary pause to the. 80 rezonings in suburban sound districts until after the committee makes its recommendations.That that would be a policy consideration either for council or CPD. Um. And there would be. Something that that you could take up as a council or take to CPD management to see if they'd be willing to do something like that.Okay. Thank you. Libby, I have a question. The applicant's not here. And then you said you knew that he had talked to building services. Do you know anything about his proposed plans?I do not know specifics. I just know that he has spoken to them.Okay. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Cashman. You're not an excellent Councilman Flynn.Thank God the President made in your reply. I seem to recall in the last term of Council we we issued a moratorium on slot homes. Until we figured out how we wanted to alter the rules and regulations and the zoning criterion for slot homes.And so we did not accept any new applications for that building form until we settled that. So would this be this policy you say would be in our hands, or is this something, in your opinion, CPD could simply.Since Josh's committee is just getting started, say, you know, look where we have tons of zoned districts that allow you to use and we will continue to process those. But for areas where we're going to study how to incorporate them into the context and character of suburban context and other zoned districts where we might not have theDash one available, we're not going to process any. It's going to just going to be a year. Heck, if we approve this tonight, this fellow might not be able to get his permit for another two years. The way you are considering my my neighbor trying to build a deck took nine months to get a deck permit.Right. Moratorium is certainly one option that council would have, but there would be legal criteria that council would have to meet in order for a moratorium to.I'm sorry. Could you speak up a little more? I'm sorry. What's into the mike.Okay. Yeah. So a moratorium would be an option that council could pursue, but they would have to, of course, check with Legislative Council and make sure whether or not for that type of more time would meet the criteria.But would it be something appropriate for CPD to administratively say, we're not going to consider applications with waivers at this point until this process is done?Well, I think that's a question for CPD management, but I, I don't think that that is probably the direction that CPD would like to pursue, because there's so much guidance within the current comprehensive plan and blueprint Denver that are calling for addus throughout the city.Certainly. Certainly. But the blueprint also has direction to do certain things in order first, such as this study, which has not yet been done. So. All right. But they don't have there's no legal prohibition to them saying we're not going to consider issuing waivers or recommending rezonings with waivers until the new standards are figured out.No legal bar to that.I'm not understanding your question. I'm sorry.Could could CPD say to applicants who come in like like this one, that there is no zone district that allows in to you on 125 foot deep lot in suburban context. If you were 150 feet deep, you could go ahead with it.But we're not going to process applications for rezonings that rely on waivers from current forms in the code, current standards in the code. Until this effort that kicks off on Thursday comes up with consistent standards that we will then follow.Is there a legal bar to CPD taking that policy with the public?Well, if if council approved this rezoning with waivers, then the applicant could move forward with building their aid. Right.That's that wasn't my question. How could CPD say to an applicant, we are not going to advance this application?They could or they could advance the application with a recommendation of denial if that if that's the direction they wanted to go.I understand that they currently they wouldn't want to do that. Thank you. That's all.Okay. Thank you, Councilwoman Sandoval.Thank you, Madam President. To answer Councilman Flynn's question about the moratorium. That was Councilman Espinosa. And Councilman, we knew who proposed the moratorium, and they used the criteria that we were trying to solve a problem for. There's only a certain reason why you can use a moratorium.So I've often thought about that in certain in certain areas of development. So it gets complicated when the moratorium. But I do understand that we do have this process and it does seem like we don't have a zone district in this area.And I know that it it it's not best practices to use waivers and conditions on anything in rezoning. I know that's not looked highly upon for CPD. So for you to be coming forward with a recommendation to use waivers for an accessory dwelling unit.I don't think I've ever seen that before. I'll just say that. Thank you, Madam President.Okay. Thank you, Councilman Hines.Thank you. Madam President, pro tem Nate. Sorry to bring you up again.They? We have a question for you.Welcome back. So the so I'm going to go down the same kind of line of question. I think that Councilmember Flynn was going down so we could, as a council, pass something that issues a moratorium on any new development at all if we wanted to.Is that right?Yes, sir. That would be legislative.And and we could, as a council, pass something that limited to use in suburban contexts if we wanted to.That is also correct.But it is not possible for us to consider and pass that before we pass what we're considering right now tonight. Is that right?That's correct. So.Okay. So while we could consider that, that is only theory and conjecture until we make a determination tonight. Yes, sir. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.Thank you. I see no others in Q Libby, just one question that I have on Slide 16, I think. Strategy. Just if you can clarify for me, it says unless there is a neighborhood plan supporting any use and we don't have a neighborhood plan here, rezonings should be small in area in order to minimize impact to thesurrounding residential area. What does that mean, small in area?Yeah. So for us, you know, a lot of times it's these individual rezonings that come in. You know, the an impact of one eighth you won't necessarily be a huge impact on the surrounding area. Now, that doesn't preclude the neighborhood wide aviaries because we have other guidance that talks about large legislative rezonings.Okay. So the area is are there other edu rezonings that have come through in this neighborhood?I do. I don't know in this specific neighborhood, but I know that there have been others that have gone through in the suburban context.Okay. Did those those revised F-1?Yes. The one that has gone through, I think went to SC F1 because it would have met the parameters of the depth and the size.Can you remind me what the F one depth is?Yeah. So it's 150 feet and then a minimum zone lot size of 8500 square feet.Got it. Thank you. Okay. I don't have any other questions, seeing no one else in queue. Public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council and Council Bill 20 2-004 for Councilwoman Black.Thank you, madam pro tempore is the the other one that was approved actually was in this neighborhood and. There were a lot of questions about it, including some opposition. In this neighborhood and in my district, we're starting to see some of these applications pop up.And I do have constituents who don't want to use. There's those people. I actually am very supportive of ideas. Well, I also have heard from a lot of people who are very concerned about the building for. And they live in a suburban neighborhood.They don't have an alley. And the thought of having a two storey structure looming over their back fence with windows, looking in their backyard, shading their garden is not something that they bargained for. And I I've never used the health, safety and welfare criteria.I don't believe as a reason not to vote for something. But I am not going to support this for that reason. It's just not something that community members bargained for when they moved to these suburban neighborhoods. And while I do support HD use, I feel like we need to have an agreed upon building form that is moreconducive to these kinds of neighborhoods. These houses are all single storey, and someone could build a two storey structure five feet from the neighbor's fence. And I'm just not comfortable with that. And without the applicant being here to answer questions.I'm sorry, I just don't think this is something I can support tonight, but thank you for your work and I really look forward to being on the committee and resolving this so we can move forward with rezonings in the future.Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Flynn.Thank you, Madam Pro-Tem. In my analysis, this application fails to meet four of the five criteria. I don't believe it's consistent with adopted plans. Sometimes it seems to me that we cherry pick statements and adopted plans here and there with which the application can be seen as consistent.And it does in the ones that we choose to highlight in the staff report or the presentation. But then we ignore other statements in the plans with which the application is inconsistent. So in blueprint land use and built form recommendation for a study quote study and implement allowances for aid use study and implement allowances for 80 use, including those attached and detached from the primary home in all neighborhood contexts and residential zone districts use an inclusive community input process to respond to unique considerations in different parts of the city. This recommendation was not done and this application is not consistent with that 40 recommendation and blueprint quote A citywide approach to enable aid to useis preferred until a holistic approach is in place. Individual rezonings to enable to use in all residential areas, especially where proximate to transit parenthetically which this one is not, are appropriate unless there is a neighborhood plan supporting a to use rezoning should be small an area in order to minimize impacts to the surrounding residential area.So here the property is in a suburban context district that would accommodate a rezoning if it met the form standards currently in the code. But it does not it's only it has insufficient lot depth blueprint would support a rezoning to F1 is consistent if the parcel were 150 feet deep.But in light of the fact that in three days the city is kicking off a project to come up with the recommended standards. Waivers are inappropriate and in my view, not consistent with Blueprint's guidance on 82 rezonings are proceeding after an inclusive community process and study prior to implementation.And then finally in Blueprint five, see states revise detached adu form standards to be more context sensitive, including standards for height, mass and setbacks. We've done none of that in the context of this application. Mr. Pomeroy's committee is going to come up with those, and I'm sure that in a year's time we will have something like that, so that, as the councilwoman said, where you have a parcel with a one storey house in the front, you don't end up with a two storey separate dwelling unit five feet from the back, from the neighbor's back fence.So we have not yet revised those form standards. And Blueprint says we should do that. We have not done it. CPD staff and Josh, you might remember this. I pulled my hair out when I got these emails. CPD staff recently sent a representative of a property owner in my district.To me, he was applying to rezone a property for an idea in a district that as of now doesn't even have such an option in the code. I think it was opseu c 6000 square foot lot minimum, which it matter was 6200 square feet, but there was no way for me to form for that.So this representative told me that he was advised to come to me and to the R.A. with a remit, with a proposal to rezone it into a totally different context. Urban edge right in the middle of this vast sea of suburban context, we were going have one parcel on a lot in Brentwood that would suddenly have anurban edge context completely not appropriate. And my understanding is that maybe he might have misunderstood the guidance from staff when when they sent him to me. But I certainly hope we don't get any any more represent any more applications like that.The next criterion I believe, it fails to meet is uniformity of district regulations. It's not consistent unless this criterion is completely meaningless. The very nature of this request is precisely to be inconsistent with the s as you f zone district regulations.That's the point of the of the waivers. I don't believe it meets the fourth criterion justifying circumstances. In fact, in my view, the circumstances justify holding off on this rezoning because the project is coming up in three days to come up with the standards and building form standards and regulations for ADA use in areas like suburban withoutalleys. This application puts us, this Council, in the position of signaling to the advisory committee that has yet to meet what the outcome should be and we should not be determining the outcome this way. We could end up with an inconsistent zone district in this.In this instance, if we were to approve this, as I mentioned, we had a moratorium on the new slot home form. I know that we don't have time to do that here. But for that reason, though, Madam Pro-Tem and colleagues, I'm going to vote against this application.I also don't believe, by the way, that it meets Criterion five consistency with neighborhood context description for the reasons I've already stated, which I think are very obvious. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Hines.Thank you, President Pro Tem. The stakeholder process that we're about to kick off hopefully will change the policy that we currently have. But we should make a decision to nine based on the policy we currently have. We shouldn't kick off a stakeholder process that would retroactively go back and apply to this, or we shouldn't try to predictwhat that stakeholder process might give us and a year or so in the future and try to vote tonight based on what we think that stakeholder process might give us. I'm not saying that your other ideas are right or wrong.I just mean we shouldn't try to. That seems like a lot of work. It seems like way more work than just using the criteria that we have today to judge today. Thank you.Councilwoman Sawyer.Thanks, Madam President.Something that Councilman Hines just said I think is really important. And I just wanted to flag Councilman Flynn talked about it a little bit as well. We need to follow the procedures we have in place. And the purpose of putting.The form base zoning code.In in 2010 was so that we didn't have waivers anymore.And whether a waiver is.Granting something or whether a waiver is limiting something.The use of waivers is pretty rare.And so to me that says this doesn't belong in this district at this time. And so I'm also going to be an alternate thinks thank you seeing no others in Q I know one of the things that we've discussed a lot in West Denver are issues in lots that are smaller than the current criteria allows.And so but we've also seen single family homeowners fit to, I think, the neighborhood context and not exactly go to full entitlement either. So I think there is some flexibility around desiring and wanting to see things like 80 use permitted to be built, built in anywhere in Denver and working with residents and homeowners to make sure theythey fit. If they tore down that single family home, they can build a bigger home. It takes up much more of the envelope of that property without, you know, without rezoning either or or additional waivers. So I appreciate, I think, the discomfort with flexing what is currently in the zoning code, but I don't know that it wasit necessarily goes against, I think, the intention of blueprint. I will I think this one, though, really does, I think call into question a couple issues that have come up with smaller lot sizes and just guidance on whether something that applies in an F one with 25 additional feet still applies as is in a smaller lot.So I think that kind of guidance is desired here. And one of the things that I won't be supporting it tonight either, but I do know that that is one of the things that CPD is responding to in terms of really making it use accessible and flexible for lots of different lot sizes.So I appreciate that from the department that the public hearing is closed. Oh, we already did that. Right. Uh, Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 22, dash 004 for.Black. Clark.No. FLYNN No. Herndon No.Hines No.Cashman No.Ortega No. Sandoval No. Sawyer No. Madam President?No. Madam Secretary, closed the voting and announced the results. Ten days, ten days.

I just want to thank the Select Committee, thank central staff Director Aristide for working with me to make some changes to the legislation before it came to full council. The the changes that we made in the Select Committee specified that the new use for admissions revenues applies only to the lease agreement for the arena andonly with respect to the admissions tax generated through the operations of the new arena. The reason why this is so important is back in 2017, the city I'm sorry, 2015, the city council passed legislation allocating 75% of all of the ad tax revenue to go to fund the Office of Arts and Culture in the next year in2016. The City Council sort of made a commitment to a multi-year ramp up of of admissions tax with 20 in 2016 going up to up to 80% in 2017 going up to 90%. And in 2018, just last year, we brought it up to 100%.So this this legislation that is as it is before us today, allows us to maintain that commitment to the Office of Arts and Culture.

And so this is obviously the opportunity for the Council to engage on the largest part of our budget, which is public safety as well as our infrastructure budget.So with that, I will turn it over to Mr. West.Mayor Councilmembers We were very, very excited to present the fiscal year 19 budget, I think, last week. So this is our first budget presentation. We're starting off as we normally do, with our continuum of care. Tonight, you're going to hear first from our fire chief, Mike Terry, then from our chief of police, Robert Lunar, then from ourdisaster management director, Reggie Harrison. Then we can either hear questions, questions from the council, or we can go straight into Craig Beck's Capital Improvement Project. And then for questions.Let me ask the council, unless there's any objection. I know that different people like it different ways. Last year we just we heard all the presentations and then we did questions. So I'll keep it that way unless people want to have.Department by department. Is there any objection to keeping it the same way? No. Okay, great.So we'll go through all four. So, Craig, you'll follow disaster management.So the mission was the one where we do have to divide it up, I think is we need a separate CIP. We certainly have a safety continuum because those are two very separate.Never mind what I just said. Okay.Thank you.Okay. So right now we will start with our fire chief, Mike Terry might take it away. All right. Good evening, Mayor Garcia, members of the city council. This evening, I will be giving you a brief overview of the Long Beach Fire Department's fiscal year 19 proposed budget.My presentation will touch upon the services provided by the Fire Department some of our key accomplishments for the current fiscal year. Notable changes for the fiscal year 19 proposed budget and some major challenges and opportunities that we foresee in the upcoming fiscal year.The Fire Department delivers fire rescue and emergency medical services, marine safety response, hazardous materials response, and non-emergency response services to residents, businesses and visitors. In the city of Long Beach, we provide a 24 hour operation for which all first responders must be prepared at all times.Additionally, we work to ensure the safety of the community and to prevent fires through proactive fire prevention and code enforcement programs. And we also provide training and education that is essential to the delivery of our core fire and rescue services.I'd now like to outline some of the fire department's accomplishments and highlights for the current fiscal year. Over the past 12 months, we have responded to over 72,000 fire, emergency medical services, mine safety and other emergency incidents. This equates to more than 153,000 individual unit responses.Included in this number are over 52,000 medical calls and 5800 fire calls. This number also includes hazardous materials responses, airport responses and other non fire responses. This year, we converted our patient care reporting system from paper to electronic.Our new electronic patient care reporting system, or EPR, has resulted in better patient tracking, improved communication with area receiving hospitals, robust real time data collection and retrieval and expedited ambulance billing. Also, earlier this year, we partnered with the water department to place a pump pod into service.This particular piece of equipment enables us to save over 1.8 million gallons of water each year by recycling water use during training, testing and certification exercises. Our training division developed and conducted training to address response to mass casualty incidents of a criminal nature such as those involving active shooters.Our Fire Recruit Academy Class 2018, a graduated 19 new firefighters and our Community Emergency Response Team or CERT program, continues to be a busy and popular program. This year alone, over 155 adults received cert training, which they will be able to use to assist the community in case of an earthquake or other natural disaster.Finally, the fire department instituted a mental health first aid program and began providing training to our fire and marine safety first responders. Training is provided by our Hart Team members and equips first responders with strategies to assist individuals experiencing a mental health or substance use related crisis.The proposed fiscal year 19 budget for the fire department is $126.8 million. We have a total of 531 full time equivalent staff consisting of 406 sworn is in fire ranks. Another 25 full time year round marine safety first responders and over 180 seasonal lifeguards.26 full time ambulance operators. Additionally, the fire department is supported by a civilian staff in fire operations, support services, fire prevention and Fire Administration. As you can see in the graph, most of our budget or $96.4 million or 76% of the department's total budget is in the general fund, which supports most departmental activities.The Long Beach Park, the Long Beach Airport provides financial support in the amount of $5.9 million for fire and rescue services that the fire department provides. The airport and this is included in the fire department's general fund budget.22% of the department's budget is in the Tidelands Fund, which supports marine safety activities, as well as our fire operations in the Port of Long Beach. The harbor department provides cost reimbursement for services provided in the port, and that is also included in the $27.8 million Tidelands Fund budget for fire.Rounding out the fire department's budget are the Police and Fire Public Safety Oil Production Act Fund, also referred to as Prop H, which provides an additional support of $1.6 million for fire staffing and the Cooper Fund, which provides for funding for inspection services and business emergency plan reviews to ensure hazardous chemicals are handled, stored and transported inaccordance with current state and local standards. The fiscal year 19 budget includes ongoing funding for a second Homelessness, Education and response team or heart unit. The mission of the Hart team is to reduce the number of fire department responses to individuals experiencing homelessness through rapid response to 911 calls for service, collaborating with our continuum of care partnersand educating fire, the fire service and community members about issues surrounding homelessness and available resources in our city. Our first heart unit has attained great amount of success toward meeting this mission, and the addition of a second heart team will allow us to build on that success and reach even more people in their time of need.The fiscal 19 fiscal year 19 budget also provides one time funding for a second fire academy. This will this will allow us to fill our current and projected vacancies. Additional changes in the budget include support for a firefighter inspector, a development services permit counter to streamline plan services and a second storekeeper to ensure proper inventory controls andmaintain warehouse operations that experience a high volume of transactions. Looking forward to fiscal year 19. The department has several significant challenges and opportunities. Our first challenge is to continue to meet the expectations of the community while facing increased demands for services, especially emergency medical services.Another challenge is for us to continue to identify emerging public safety issues and implement programs that meet the needs of our community. In addition to providing fire and emergency medical response services, it is important that we remain aware of other public safety needs and try and stay agile as an organization so that we can implement innovative programslike the Hart Team. While we. While we. Excuse me. We need to be aware. Excuse me. We are aware that we need to improve diversity not just in the ranks of entry level firefighters, but also in the promotional classifications like fire captain and battalion chief.In fiscal year 19, we will work with the Civil Service Department and one of the city's new management assistants to identify solutions that address this important challenge. We also have a number of retirements in supervisory and management positions coming up in the next several years.And that means we face the challenge of identifying and developing the next generation of leaders requiring strong management, development and succession planning programs. And a final challenge is to maximize available revenue sources and attain full cost recovery for our services.We provide our community whenever feasible. With resources and support in the fiscal year 19 budget. We also have a number of opportunities and reasons for ongoing optimism. First, the potential restoration of Engine 17 would further improve our emergency response capabilities.These increased capabilities would have a positive impact on the entire service delivery system throughout the city, not just in Engine 17 immediate response area. We also have an opportunity to improve quality assurance, data collection and cost recovery through the implementation of our electronic patient care reporting system, referred to as PCR that I mentioned earlier.In the few months since implementation, we've already begun to realize some of these benefits, and with a second Hart unit in service, the fire department and our Continuum of Care partners have an opportunity to expand services to individuals experiencing homelessness.And finally, investments in our public safety infrastructure, specifically funding to renovate and modernize our fire stations and our fire training center will enable us to improve our service delivery and overall working conditions. Mr. Mayor and Council Members, I thank you for the opportunity to present an overview of the Fire Department's Fiscal Year 2019 proposed budget.This concludes my presentation and I'll wait to respond to any questions you may have after I handed over to my partner, the Chief of Police. Thank you, Fire Chief Dewey. Good evening, Mayor Garcia. Vice Mayor sitting over there and members of the city council.The police department is a is a dynamic organization. We are tasked with the incredible responsibility of enforcing laws, investigating crime. Securing the city's critical infrastructure. And fostering positive relationships and trust within our diverse community. Most importantly, we respond to our community's calls for help 24 hours a day, seven days a week.The police department's mission is public safety. Through partnerships, public safety services are delivered through the work of five Barrel's 17 divisions and over 100 distinct units and sections. Our core services include 911 response across the city's 52 square miles, with over 211,000 calls for service in 2017, which averages to about 578 calls for service on a dailybasis. Investigating misdemeanor and felony crimes ranging from murder to bike theft. The child abuse. Securing major critical infrastructure, including the port, the airport and metro blue line that you just heard the presentation on previously. And providing contract services to city partners such as the Long Beach Unified School District, Long Beach, City College, Long Beach Transit and thePike Outlets just to name a few. Long Beach Police Department operates on all cylinders. Throughout the year, our employees and volunteers are absolutely doing amazing work. As you will see in the next few slides, our department has many accomplishments in FY 18.Thanks to the mayor and measure funding, the South Division was restored and became operational in February of 2017. The restoration of South Division represents our community's ongoing support to invest in public safety. I am also proud to share that the police department has officially completed its first year of providing services to L.A. Metro over the past year. Officers had approximately 17,000 Metro related contacts, which included calls for service and officer initiated activity. This roughly equates to approximately 50 contacts per day. Response time to the Metro rated metro related emergency calls was 2.4 minutes for those priority calls and 6.7 minutes to routine calls, which is actually pretty amazing.This past year marks a successful public safety partnership between L.A. Metro and our city. The size and scale of special events are dramatically larger in the previous than the previous years. As such, the demand for police services to staff these events has increased significantly.In calendar year 2017. Our officers staffed 170 events. Those events generated 220 days of staffing. So far in calendar year 2018, 150 events have been staffed, generating 186 days of staffing year to date. We have provided staffing for 14 large concerts and music festivals, 98 film productions, 44 parades and holiday staffing.In total, the police department has secured safety for nearly 1 million special event attendees. In technology. The police department recently deployed 200 body cameras in the south and north divisions through a one year no cost contract. We are grateful to the Departments of Technology and Innovation, Financial Management, Public Works and the City Attorney's Office for their assistancein making this new program possible. We look forward to updating the City Council on the progress of this new body worn camera program. Responding to homelessness and quality of life issues are priorities to our community and therefore are top priorities for our entire department.However, I would like to highlight our quality of life officers who have done tremendous work in addressing homelessness challenges in our city. Since January of this year. Quality of Life officers have made 644 contacts with persons experiencing homelessness.They have provided referrals, supplies and mental health evaluations. They have helped transport 149 individuals to the Multi-Service Center, Long Beach Rescue Mission and other social service organizations. They've helped 103 individuals, and they participated in 174 homeless encampment cleanups.This is absolutely amazing work. And I do want to point out, even though I'm highlighting the police department, this is absolutely a team effort with other city departments. The police department is an active supporter and participant in diversion programs as an alternative to arrest and as a solution to reduce recidivism.In addition to our Youth Diversion partnerships with our local nonprofits, we partner with the L.A. County Sheriff's Department, the L.A. County Office of Diversion and Reentry, and the City Prosecutor's Office to assist with grant funded diversion outreach focused along the Long Beach Boulevard corridor.We also participate in the countywide Youth Diversion Program. I am excited to share that we continue to partner with the Office of Civic Innovation, formerly known as the A-Team under the Justice Lab. Together, we are working to better identify individuals who are current high frequency offenders and determine their social service needs.As part of this effort. The Jail Mental Health Clinician Program, in partnership with the Guidance Center is underway. In addition, we are firming up the data sharing and communication between our patrol commanders, crime analyst and data researchers with the Office of Civic Innovation.The Police Department continues to provide training and develop policies aligned with the Task Force Report on 21st Century Policing, which was released back in 2015. As part of this effort, our training division provides innovative training principles consistent with the current industry standards.Topics include procedural justice, implicit bias, fair and impartial policing, and assisting individuals with mental illness. In addition, a special order was issued department wide outlining police department procedures that align our department's operations with SB 54 and the Long Beach Values Act.Building community trust through relationships is a foundational principle supported by the Long Beach Police Department. This year we have hosted 13 community police academies funded by the PCC grant. Since the community support for this program has been so extremely positive.We plan to host future community police academies in 2019 and have already expanded the curriculum to include youth community police academies, which were showcased recently on the local Long Beach network. I am happy to report that the police recruit class number 92, which is slated to graduate here in the next week, which started back in February of2018, closely mirrors the ethnic demographics of our community. It's 67% minority. Highlighting our commitment to support the advancement of diversity within our department. With the great work of our Community Engagement Division, we have ramped up our social media presence on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram in an effort to humanize our police officers.Under the umbrella campaign of hashtag. Long Beach Police Department cares, the warmth and compassion of our police personnel are consistently showcased. In Fy19, the proposed police department budget totals nearly $259 million and includes which includes all funds. The police department is supported by the general fund, grant funds, gas and oil tax revenue and the Title IX Fund. The police department also generates revenue through fees, charges for contract police services and revenue from other agencies. In Fy19, the department is proposed to generate $45 million in revenue for the General Fund, General Grants Fund and the Tidelands Fund.The total FTE count is proposed to increase from 1214 FTE in FY18 to 1241 FTEs in Fy19. The increase includes three net new sworn positions, as well as the transfer of 27 civilian positions from the airport department to the police department.I would like to take this opportunity to highlight some of our department's notable changes. The Police Department's proposed FOIA 19 budget includes an overall increase in sworn in civilian positions. Personnel changes include two additional quality of life officers funded by Measure one officer in the North Division and one officer in the West Division.This mean this means that we all have a quality of life officer in each geographical patrol division. Two New Quality of life officers and one detective to support blue line operations. The Homeland Security Lieutenant will be transferred to oversee the airport police section.As I stated earlier, this will include the transfer of 27 special services officer positions from the airport department to the airport police section. Two new civilian positions to support the department's personnel and financial workload. And and as part of operational efficiencies, 4.5 vacant civilian positions will be eliminated in addition.And it's part of the proposed plan to reduce one vacant lieutenant and one vacant sergeant position to the police officer classification. Other changes include a pilot program to deploy up to four civilian community service officers in the field to assist with select priority three non-emergency calls for service and continued funding for background investigations for cannabis related medicaland recreational use business applicants. We are grateful for the Council's support for one time funding in past years and propose the following one time funding for 19 a second back to back police academy. Funding for an upgrade to our records management system which will ensure we are in compliance with state and federal mandates.1.9 million in Neighborhood Safe Streets funding to support community based, focused enforcement, and $100,000 to support the jail mental health clinician in FY 19. The law enforcement profession is and is is evolving. And at no other time has it changed so much, so quickly.The demands, accountability and expectations have never been higher. The next slide will highlight a few current and future challenges facing our police department and profession. Criminal justice reforms continue to negatively impact our police department and our community, as does unfunded state and federal mandates.These federal mandates and state legislation have placed new technology, data gathering and reporting requirements on local law enforcement agencies. Unfunded mandates impact our ability to prioritize and administratively support our core function when limited or no funding is made available by federal and state legislators.Looking ahead, future legislation also seeks to change use of force standards, which will not only significantly impact police training during the response to threatening situations, it could endanger the lives of our officers and members of our community. In totality, the police department is facing an ever changing legal environment, and adapting to these changes requires many financial resourcesthat must be absorbed by our department and city. Additionally, the police department actively applies for grants from the federal, state and county levels. Recent DOJ grant applications require mandatory certifications to comply with ICE data request and other communication conditions.We have paused applying for DOJ grants that require these certifications and will continue to confer with the City Attorney's Office to review new grants that may be of interest to our department and city. One of our most challenging issues is homelessness and our community safety concerns.In January, 250 police chiefs from the nation's largest police departments, as well as local government researchers and community partners, convened in Long Beach for an executive level dialog on homelessness. As we all know, this is a community wide challenge, although the law enforcement community collectively advocates for compassionate and fair treatment of individuals experiencing homelessness.When the law is violated, enforcement action will be taken. An enforcement tool that is useful in addressing recurring homeless challenges is the stay away order system, which organizes court ordered stay away orders in public locations that are target targets for misdemeanor activity.This has been helpful in addressing the needs of residents, neighborhood groups, local businesses and other public locations that have been challenged by ongoing criminal activity. Across the country and specifically in Southern California, the Southern California region. Police departments, including our own, are facing high rates of attrition due to retirements.This is a natural demographic pattern given the large hiring trends that occurred 25 to 30 years ago. Coupled with a healthier economy and competition among local and regional police departments, it is more challenging than ever to on board and retain police recruits.In Fy19, we will maximize our opportunities to support the needs of the department and our community. We look forward to the potential restoration and funding for a community rapid response. Bike team composed of one sergeant and five bike officers.Well, it has been a challenge to implement new technology solutions. We are looking forward to the rollout of Long Beach Coast, a new records management system. The increased use of body worn cameras. Additional contributions to the open data portal.And the new citywide fiber plan. Upgrades to citywide technology and police related platforms can make routine activities more efficient, encourage transparency, and allow for more refined data analysis. The police department is also looking forward to rebuilding a training center, which will be an asset to our community and region.We will finally retire 20 year old trailers and cinder block buildings at the training division, which have been operating past their useful life. Lastly, to address challenges in police recruiting, we will once again partner with the Office of Civic Innovation.We will follow the City of Lee's I-Team approach to do a full assessment of our recruitment, selection, onboarding and training process to identify any opportunities for improvement. This concludes my presentation, and as always, I'll be going after the Master of Disaster for questions.Thank you to you for that great introduction. Really appreciate that as always. Mayor, vice mayor and members of the City Council, thank you for this opportunity to present the fiscal year 19 proposed budget for the Department of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Communications.I also want to thank the city manager, the police chief, the fire chief for their support, collaboration and keen understanding of the critical role that this department plays in the public safety continuum. Natural and man made disasters have dominated news headlines throughout the year.Over the past month, an unprecedented number of wildfires have burned. From Northern California to Southern California, over 600,000 acres have been burned. Hundreds of thousands of residents have been evacuated. A few thousand structures have been destroyed. And unfortunately, 11 lives have been lost, including those of six firefighters.Each disaster, rather manmade on its orders, that is a disaster. Either manmade or natural, serves as a reminder to the city of Long Beach and its residents of how important it is to be prepared, have an evacuation plan, a disaster, go kit, and be prepared to be self-sustaining for at least seven days while first responders are enroute to the scene. Lessons that we've learned from recent disasters is just how quickly the public tends to respond to provide aid when disasters occur. During recent hurricanes, neighbors and motorboats, canoes and even Paddleboards were first on the scene to aid fellow residents trapped by rising waters.Therefore, I offer I 19 budget and staff work plans reflect greater work with our residents and recognition that neighbors will be the first ones in our communities to take action after disaster strikes and before first responders arrive. After the fires and the mudslides in Northern California, we learned that residents will heed emergency notification warnings from police andfire and emergency managers to evacuate or shelter in place. Alert notification warnings that are sent timely with consistent and concise managed messages, if heeded, can and will save lives. Therefore, our budget and staff work plans reflect a greater investment in tools and technology to notify the greatest amount of residents and visitors possible more effectively using multiple methodsof communications. And finally, this year is the 50th anniversary of the first call to 911. And while we celebrate this occasion with our dispatchers, we are well aware that 911 equipment across the country are aged and in use.24 seven. Long Beach is no exception. Therefore, we have invested in new corps communications systems to ensure clear and predictable communications with our residents and first responders in the field. The Department recognizes the important role that we play as part of the public safety continuum.We are dedicated to making Long Beach a more prepared city through our emergency communication systems and our disaster preparedness, outreach and training programs through through the department's course services. We've touched the lives of our residents in many important ways.The core services of the department are really echoed in its title. We provide 911 communications for police, fire and emergency medical calls for service. And we are responsible to work with our city staff, our community partners, hospitals, school district transit agencies and the business community to provide to respond effectively to a major emergency or disaster.The department is also responsible for the coordination of the city's Homeland Security grant funds. Accomplishments in the 911 call center include handling over 800,000 calls for service and answering 90% of those calls with an industry standard of 10 seconds.We completed the replacement and upgrade of both our radio dispatch system and a911 telephone system at a combined cost of just over $8 million, funded through Homeland Security grant funds and the California Office of Emergency Services. And I am proud to note those upgrades were completed without any disruption and emergency calls for services in December.Reliance Text to 911 system which provides equal access to emergency services to residents who are hearing and or speech impaired. The system can also be used by residents in situations where it is too dangerous to call 911. The department was rest was recently approved by FEMA to implement the Federal Wireless Emergency Alert Messaging System.This system allows the city to send emergency messages to residents and visitors directly to their mobile phones. Similar to the way Amber Alerts are sent, there is no need to sign up to receive these messages. The system will be used in the event of a major citywide disaster.The system will be supplemental to our current alert Long Beach system. And as was stated earlier, we coordinated Homeland Security grant funding this year totaling $14 million, a portion of which was used for the radio replacement project. Accomplishments in the area of disaster preparedness include implementation of the pilot ready your Long Beach Neighborhood Program in two neighborhoods. The Ready Your Neighborhood Long Beach program trains residents to identify those at risk in their neighborhoods elderly neighbors, mobility impaired neighbors who will require assistance during a disaster. The program also trains neighbors to identify the resources they have retired nurses, neighbors who have ladders and other generators that can be used during a disaster.This program teaches. And prepares residents to work together in the event of a disaster. And we're really, really happy to have been able to work with the Grant neighborhood in the ninth District to pilot two neighborhood programs. We are also really pleased to have established a Long Beach disaster relief fund just today, announced in partnership with Lambie'sCommunity Foundation. This fund is designed to provide assistance with local recovery efforts for incidents not covered by FEMA. The fund is managed by the foundation, and contributions to the foundation can be made at the Lambie's Community Foundation website.This was a very busy year for us. We conducted outreach to over 30 community businesses and resident groups on business disaster preparedness topics. We also maintained a robust social media presence, and we conducted or participated in a number of annual preparedness events, including the Tsunami Walk and Preparedness Fair, our Pet Preparedness Month Outreach Program, and the upcomingReady Land based Preparedness Expo, which we invite all residents to attend on September the 15th at Cal State Long Beach campus. And finally, we continue to receive reimbursements from FEMA for claims following the 2017 winter storm, events so far totaling $600,000 in reimbursements.We accomplished all of that with minimal impact to the city's general fund. 80% of the department's budget is devoted to 911 call taking and dispatching. The remaining budget covers disaster preparedness, outreach and training, facility maintenance and Homeland Security Grant Administration.The department's notable changes include a new disaster preparedness officer, Jeff Duvall. Jeff, would you stand? We recently recruited Jeff from the city of Anaheim, where he held a similar position for a number of years. We also are pleased to announce a new administrative officer, Diane Brown.Who's handling the slides at this moment. But please stand, Diane, to be recognized. We recruited Diane from Long Beach City College, but she is no stranger to the city of Long Beach. She spent 15 years in our health department before going over to lobby City College.Both of these individuals are going to be assets to the department, and we will. And we continue to work on measure funded projects, upgrading the EOC, heating and air conditioning system using $800,000 of funding in the area of challenges and opportunities.We continue to be challenged by the slow pace by which residents have been signing up for the Long Beach. We encourage residents to sign up for a look at Long Beach so that we can ensure everyone receives timely notification in the event of a disaster.To help with the sign ups, we are in the process of switching a little Long Beach to a new vendor who will make the sign up process easier and quicker. Cross-training work continues with our 911 dispatchers. Cross-trained. Dispatchers have been utilized to provide additional resources for large scale incidents.We currently have 20% of the staff in the cross training program. However, our priority continues to be recruiting and training additional dispatchers to reduce overtime. And we will continue to work to expand the Ready Your Labs neighborhood program to include several additional communities yet to be identified.And finally, in October, FEMA will facilitate a tabletop exercise for our department heads to support their ability to make policy level decisions that support field responses to doing an incident. Thank you. Thank you for your support. This continued.This concludes my presentation.Thank you very much. And the last of my four speakers will be capital improvement program, actually.Vice mayor. We're now going to conclude and go to questions for the three departments, and then Mr. Beck will do capital improvements when the questions are done. Thank you.Susie. Q Yes.Thank you very much, gentlemen, for your presentations. Each of them was incredibly informative and impressive in terms of all the accomplishments. And of course, looking ahead at the opportunities, present some great opportunities for us as council members in terms of policy setting.So I'll take them in the order that they were presented for. Fire Chief Drury, thank you very much for your presentation. I note that our response times are good and they're expected to get better in Fy19. Could you share a little bit about why that's important and how the restoration of some of the fire resources that wehave has assisted and response times overall?Mayor Councilmembers. Councilmember Price. Yeah. Thank you very much for the question. Our response times have remained pretty static over the last year, although on an annual basis we still see about a 3 to 5% annual call volume increase.And so obviously the restoration of Engine eight last year and adding Rescue 12 back into the system last year helped ease the pressure that would typically be applied to our organization as a result of increasing call volumes. So across the city for first response, first engine or truck on scene, we're still writing about the same ballpark.We've been about 6 minutes and 35 seconds, and we're still meeting the national standard to get the paramedics on scene within the allotted time set out by the NFPA. Of course, to your question, as you add a resource back into the system, which our data shows clearly that we're still seeing the same call volume increases, we're stayingabout where it was and it's continued to grow over the years. Adding into the resource back into the system will enable to enable us to ease the pressure citywide. I've said this before many times publicly that just because we put a resource in North Long Beach doesn't necessarily mean it's dedicated just North Long Beach at any givenmoment throughout the day, that resource could be called upon to respond down to Naples Island or to downtown and vice versa. So as we add another resource into the system and it's been proposed Engine 17, which is over on the east side of Long Beach, that will help ease a lot of pressure that we currently feel incentral Long Beach or downtown by adding that additional resource. So we're excited about that as an opportunity, excited to continue that discussion. And I think anything that we add back into the system now will just make our system more effective than it already is.And I appreciate that explanation and I've shared with with my residents. I know we've increased response times in the third district in several areas, and that has occurred as a result of all the restorations, whether it's a rescue 12, whether it's hopefully going to be 17, whatever it is, it takes the pressure off of the whole system, and I think that's a great thing. So I wanted to highlight that. I also noted that one of the changes that you have proposed for FY 19, I think it's a really great change and I don't think it was highlighted enough, with all due respect, in your presentation, because it's actually a business friendly addition, and that's theaddition of the additional staff for Planned Trek. I think that, you know, sometimes you don't associate the fire department as as helping us be business friendly. But for us to be able to expedite this and streamline some of these requirements as businesses go through the permitting process, I think it's it's really important.So thank you. Would you like to comment on that.Councilmember? I just want to say thank you for acknowledging the work of our Fire Prevention Bureau. That that bureau is led by Deputy Chief Rick Brant, which we all know is perhaps one of the best in the business in the world of fire prevention, special events, filming all the stuff that he does and his entire team infire prevention have embraced his vision there. And that is to be more business friendly, to speed up the process and ensure that those people that want to want to do business in Long Beach know that they have a partner in the fire department, that we're going to help them get to where they want to be.So I appreciate you bringing that up. And I apologize for not highlighting a greater. Well.It's again, it's it's kind of not a natural connection. But I think that the, you know, residents may not understand the important role. And we have a team member on the city three team Lisa West, who's our business liaison.And anytime a business applies for a permit in the district, she kind of holds their hand and walks them through the process. And it's only been through her eyes that I've been able to see the work that the fire department does.So thank you for that position. I wholeheartedly support it. I also want to commend you on the use of the electronic patient care reporting system. I had the opportunity to go on a ride along with the fire department recently and got to see them use it.And my sister is one of the physicians at the New Star Behavioral Center that we have and Councilman Oranga as a district. And she told me that she is actually when the Long Beach fire has come, has been using the program and she was speaking very fondly of it.So, you know. So you can get some feedback from one of the practitioners on the other side. I think it's been very successful, so thank you for that. And then finally, just a comment to you. Gosh, it was probably about a year ago that you and I were having just an informal conversation and you shared with mesome of your vision on peer support programs. And who would have known at that time how important your commitment to peer support would have been for your department in the last year. So so kudos to you for having that vision and for making mental health mental health focus such an important part of your leadership.Both both the work that you do and the work that Chief Learner does involves leadership of a group of people who are susceptible to vicarious trauma on a daily basis. And again, your foresight was very, very, very apparent to me during the last few months.So thank you, Councilmember.I feel like I need to jump in here. That's that's as much as I embrace that. The entire command staff, the deputy chiefs, the assistant chiefs, the rank and file, our union, everybody in our organization embraced that mission together.And one of our deputy chief said during we're going through a very dark time about a month ago, said that everything we started to put in place five years ago was was preparation for that moment. And I couldn't be more thankful for the work that these men and women in the organization do and the support that theylent to that program specifically.Well, thank you. Thank you for keeping up the great work of your department despite unforeseen circumstances. We all appreciate it. Thank you. So I'm going to move on now to Chief Luna, if that's okay. Chief Luna, a couple of questions I had for you.You talk on page three of our department overview, you talk a little bit about the pilot staffing models that we have. And I was hoping that maybe you could share a little bit more about those pilot staffing models and what we're hoping to accomplish with those.And I think that's kind of the use of some non Swarns to assist to support.Members of the council. Councilwoman Price Our vision for that is, is kind of something we did years ago and we stop doing, and that's to hire civilian individuals to go out and in a pilot form and handle some priority.Three calls. Some report calls, non-injury, traffic collision, things of that nature to relieve some of the pressure from the police officers out there. There were some things that worked in the past, some things that didn't. I think it's it's worth trying and and see where it gets us and and see how.Number one, the safety of the employees is important. Is it going to increase our capacity in other areas if we can get more proactive time for our patrol officers to do either quality of life work, more crime prevention work, getting out of their cars and playing with kids in the park, that would be awesome.We're always trying to find ways to maximize our police officers times in the field, and we think this may be a way to do it.So are you open to some suggestions on what that might look like in terms of the support role?Of course.Well, I don't know how defined the program has been, but I do know. Well, first, let me just start with saying you're absolutely correct that these are changing times in the world of law enforcement and public safety. And I commend you and your command staff for being nimble and responding to some of the changes that have takenplace that have really changed the way policing is done. And although there's a lot of, you know, kind of fluffy rhetoric about how things should be done, at the end of the day, it's our police officers that people turn to when they have quality of life issues or when a crime happens and they expect them to solveevery problem. And oftentimes it's not a police problem. And when we take tools away from police officers that limit their ability to enforce laws, I think it puts a lot of pressure on police departments to solve problems that really are not their problems to solve.So I commend you for leading at a time like this, and I can understand that right now is probably one of the most challenging times for someone for police officers, because it's very hard to recruit people into the profession.With all the changes that are happening. So I appreciate your commitment to enforcement and I support your efforts to do the work on the front end, the outreach, the education, the work on the back end, and the diversion programs and efforts to rehabilitate that, balanced with the commitment to enforcement, I think, is what makes a modern daypolice chief successful. And I see all of those qualities in you. So thank you.I appreciate that. And if I could just have a quick couple seconds, if I can have a lot of our command staff is here, if you guys can just stand really quick, it's good to stretch after being sitting here for several hours, but just stand and be acknowledged.It's it's a team effort from our entire command staff and every every employee who works on this police department. Just absolutely amazing people. We're so blessed to have them all. So thank you, guys.Absolutely. Thank you. They do amazing work. And I have been I have been incredibly blessed to work one on one with several of them sitting up there. So I feel very lucky about that. So before I go back to that question about whether you're open to well, no, I'll go into it right now.So I think there there's probably some opportunities. And for us to use the resources that that you've talked about, these are new kind of creative pilots for things like supporting our police officers. You know, when an arrest is made, could there be an inventory team that would that would identify the property and store the property so thatthe officer doesn't. Could there be a booking team that would transport the individual and book that person so that the officer doesn't have to go to jail? But just, you know, those kinds of ideas of of how non sworn could be used so that we're not taking police officers off the street.But I defer entirely to you and your team on on how that works. But I will say that is something that I've heard a lot of police chiefs are looking at right now in terms of trying to manage resources with the changing staffing and the changing limitations that we have in the industry.So I, I think that that has some potential and I look forward to hearing how that rolls out in practice. You aren't one of the pages here in our budget book, we talk about key measures, performance measures, and of course, we have on their response time to priority one calls.And we have violent crime rates. And this isn't meant as a criticism whatsoever. But is there a reason we don't track property crimes or quality of life crimes as a performance measure? Because, you know, those seem to be the bulk of the calls for service that some of us get.And I wonder if there is a way to track those as a performance measure as well, or is this kind of the best practice to track these things is performance measure.We absolutely track crime and that's how we anybody would grade their police department, including ours. For us, as of July, our our July index crime report, that's the latest one we have. Our property crime is down 8.5% throughout the entire city.So that is one area that we consistently look at in regards to quality of life crimes, whether they're lower grade property crimes, that is well within what we look at. And each month. And I'd invite anybody behind the dais to join us for our monthly crime meeting.That Deputy Chief Heber facilitates to see exactly how much we do, how much we pay attention to, and the creative responses by our entire team of employees to address these these crime trends. It's it's absolutely impressive, and it's done consistently.We take this stuff personal. We lose a lot of sleep over it. We want to make sure that this city is safe and we do everything we can to make sure that happens.Thank you, Chief. I appreciate that. And I know you're committed to that. I just I would like to see those numbers highlighted more as well, because those are really important to anyone, you know, who has had a residential burglary or something and feels that that crime maybe isn't taken as seriously, because I know it is.And I want us to highlight those numbers more. So we talked a little bit about grants and in your presentation you covered grants a little bit. And I think you touched upon this, that maybe we've paused for applying for some of the grants that require certification because of the state and our position on the the Values Act. But is there any indication that national policies are going to impact our existing grants or the grants that we're relying on for Fy19?I would say yes, yes, and yes. That is such a fluid situation with national politics being what they are. There's consistent challenges in court and honestly, we're working hand in hand with our city attorney consistently to try and stay ahead of this.We don't want to miss out on any grant opportunities. And it seems like, at least in some of the ones that we weren't able to put in for because of our current city policies, those are things we're paying attention to.And obviously if we get to an area where we're deficient and funding will be coming back to this policy body to ask for additional funding, if we can't get it through the normal grant channels that we normally get them from.And Chief, I'm asking you as a as a member of this body to please do that, because it's important. I think that we know I'll tell you right now, as a matter of principle and as a matter of my fiduciary duty, having more police officers on the street and having the resources to be able to fund thatis more important to me than sending a message. And so I think if we're in a situation where you feel that significant grant funds are going to be affected by some policy that we're setting, please. I want to know that because I want to make those decisions with that in mind, because we are at a great placewith our police department. We're continuing to increase and hopefully, hopefully there is some wisdom at the highest levels of this nation that realizes that we shouldn't be punished. But if that starts to happen, then I would ask that you please keep us up to date on that.Yes, ma'am.Or there is an imposition of a traffic collision fee that we're going to be implementing. Is that a fee that's assessed to the suspect or the defendant in a DUI case?To the suspect.Or suspect or defendant. Did they have to be charged? Do we now?I'm sorry. I'd have to double check on that.Okay.No problem. Thank you. The transfer of the 27 positions at the airport, the TSOs.Does that affect their job at all, their job.Duties or their training? Is that something that is going to be impactful to those 27 individuals at all?We believe the impact will be positive. They will fall under our imbroglio, our chain of command, our training standards. And that will, even though they are great people and they've done great work out at the airport. We believe that the scenario that we're proposing makes them better, makes us better, makes our airport and city safer.Okay. Thank you, Chief.You on.Page 384.Where we outlined the summary of changes, there's a reference to downgrading two positions a sergeant and a lieutenant position. But then there was also a reference in the PowerPoint about filling two vacancies. Is that I'm sorry, removing those vacancies.Is that the same reference?There is. There is one vacancy with the sergeant. The lieutenant position is not vacant, at least not in the location that is proposed to be reduced.Do we know what departments those are going to be in?The lieutenant comes from the patrol bureau and the sergeant comes from the investigations bureau. Okay. Proposed.Okay.So my only concern with those is that, you know, there are certain that many obviously every division in the police department benefits from expertize. But there are a couple of areas where I think we especially need expertize right now.And I would hate to downgrade positions and that would be with pretty. Special events. Many of those are events are in my district and in Council Member Pearce's district. I know representing the coast. And so having that historical context and that knowledge to be able to work with and and collaborate with community members is so important thatI would hope that, you know, I wish we weren't downgrading those positions or filling those vacancies. But if that has to be done, I just would ask if there could be a second look as we go through these discussions to see if that's necessary.Yes, we will. We have been doing that. Those are very difficult positions to reduce. But in a sense, when you get the directions to balance your general fund budget, at the end of the day, that equates to about $140,000 that I'm going to have to find somewhere else.There are there are no good positions to reduce. We're just at from a capacity perspective, that's just where we're at. So it was the best case scenario of not a very good situation to begin with, if that makes sense.It does, Chief, and I appreciate you sharing that. I think it's important for me and my colleagues to understand that, because it may be important for us as we think about the budget. So I appreciate that. Thank you.I know that we're going to do a body worn camera. You know, we're doing the pilot with the 200. I've I've said this many times and I know a lot of my colleagues feel the same way. We'd love to see a full roll out of body worn cameras.And this is more, you know, a request to the city manager. I think that we think of a way that we can incorporate a full rollout in FY 20. And I'm hoping that maybe we can collect some data on the positions that we're going to be funding to examine the cost of redactions for the body worn camera, to see what the true cost of that will be and maybe pilot, you know, for those 200, how many praise are we getting and how many redactions are we actually doing? Because it may be that we've overestimated what the operating costs might be, might be.And so I just hope that we would be thinking about a FY 20. We really need to have body worn cameras throughout the whole city. I can't stress important how important that is.Yes, we agree. And that's the purpose for not going city wide deployment at this time. To do them in south and north gives us the opportunity to look at the logistics of it. The investigative portion of it, the proportion of it.And we believe doing this for the amount of time we're going to do it will give us the ability to come back and give all of you a true cost for what this would cost for a full blown body worn camera program.Great. Thank you, Chief. Do we anticipate to get some data on the clinician that's in the jail in terms of how many people the clinician sees and how many are referred to successfully for services?That is our goal. We have some very, very smart people working on our innovation team and over at the Health Department, they're all about stats and data, and I can't wait to see what comes out. I'm really excited that the city put this much effort into looking at creative solutions, not just complain about criminal justice reform, butlook at thinking out of the box and trying to figure out how to solve these problems long term.Thank you, Chief. And then I just have one final question, and that is, I know you referenced the number, I think it was 825, but how many sworn officers do we have now and what would be the ideal number of officers for a city of our size?But I'm going to I'm going to refer to some of our financial policies. But looking at it from an optimistic view.What would it be?So you notice everyone laughing over here at me when you ask me that question. Our F-18 budget, it's sworn numbers are 848. That's what we're budgeted at. And in regards to what's that right number? Honestly, four, I mean, there's formulas that different people use.And you look at formulas for each cities. If you just look at California, if you compare us to Oakland, Sacramento, Fresno, we're within about the same range. There's arguments about, you know, officers that are just assigned to you as opposed to contract bodies.Every city is unique. They have interesting needs. I can tell you this, our people are working their butts off. I believe that the officers we have are doing the same work of the officers we had seven or eight years ago before the recession hit.All of you wonderful people, but you work our butts off. And I'm not complaining. That's just the business we're in. So. So getting to the number of. Of what we need. I know when we had 1200, we used to say it wasn't enough.It just depends on the community. My job is to stay engaged with all of you, with our community consistently, listen to the needs that they have, and then try and prioritize and figure out what we can and cannot do.You guys, all of you, ladies and gentlemen, are, I think, are doing a good job of managing the city. We are with our department that runs a lot on overtime. And and like I said, our people are working their tails off.But I think we're getting the job done. So we'll continue to monitor it. I will not be shy about coming to you and saying that we're at capacity and we may not be able to do something that you're asking us to do or reshift and reprioritize because we just don't have the people to do it.Now I'm not talking. That's everyday business. If we're dealing with an emergency or where we've got to call people back to work. Our department is very well trained and very well prepared to deal with that any day of the week.Thank you, Chief. And and just in conclusion, I agree. Your department and the men and women of your department are doing tremendous work, and it's obvious in the things that they do every day. I recently have the opportunity to go to the Long Beach courthouse on an Orange County case because a judge had sent a case overto Long Beach because of a conflict. But anyway, as I was walking through the hallway in my capacity as an Orange County prosecutor, I saw the hallways of the courthouse lined with Long Beach officers. And I'm a huge sap, and I don't think anyone here is that shocked to hear that.But I literally had to take a moment in the hallway just looking out at the Sea of Black with just the sense of incredible pride for this department. I wanted to walk up to every officer and say, Hi, I'm on the council.I'm so proud of what you're doing. But I didn't do that. I just walked by them as as did the other prosecutors in the courthouse. But I just feel just I get to work with them all the time and I get to work with officers from agencies all over every day.And I'm really proud of the officers from the Long Beach Police Department. They're incredibly respectful and everything that they do and our firefighters as well. So thank you to both chiefs for everything.We really appreciate that. Just a correction on the numbers. I said before the recession, I said 1200. It's actually 1020. That was our where we were top budgeted numbers before. I just want to correct that before somebody puts out in the paper and says something about that.Thank you, Chief. Okay. So just one final question. I have and I really don't want to call you the master of disaster or whatever it is they've been calling you. I'm not sure. Do you like it? I don't.I can't tell if you like it. You don't like it? I don't.Think so. Remember that it originated somewhere?Yes. By the city manager.I believe.I've heard it come out of his mouth. Anyway, I wanted to just acknowledge the great outreach and partnership that you and your team have been doing. We've been privileged to have two San Army walks with your team, and I think they both had great turnouts and it's been fantastic.So thank you for that. The 911 operators, you talked about the ongoing training. I just want to make sure that that training also includes maybe how to interact with the residents that are calling about. The priority three calls are the quality of life calls, because some of the concerns that we get sometimes from residents is that ifthey're case that they're calling on isn't a priority one call that maybe, you know, they get a dismissive tone or something like that. I just want to make sure that every resident feels heard and that that training includes that type of education.Yeah, totally. Totally agree. Councilmember, if you recall that the Public Safety Committee meeting a couple of months ago, we talked about, you know, what residents should expect when they call and what they should expect from our dispatchers. And one of the primary things is that every call is important and the residents should feel that way and assureresidents that help will be on the way for their calls, the way that they're prioritized. So we don't make that distinction in that regard. They're all important to us. We really appreciate, Councilmember, your support of the annual Tsunami Evacuation Walk and Resource Fair.It's growing every year in size and scope. And we think that's and that's an important community event that you support and that we try to support with you.Of course, it's our pleasure to do so. And and a huge kudos to a nine on one operator. So I ask that question not because I've identified any opportunities for improvement, because having worked with Commander Herzog, he's really good at when residents would say, well, I called 911 and they said, blah, blah, blah.He would pull the tape and send it. And sure enough, there were some factual inaccuracies in some of the way that the phone calls were reported. And in every single time that I had the opportunity to listen to those calls, it was always the dispatchers who were very respectful and frankly, often abused by people for no apparentreason. And I just think they do a really great job of standing their ground, but also being very empathetic. So thank you.They? Excuse me.Okay, you guys, I just woke up. Okay. This is mango units.Thank you. Knowing that I have the pleasure to serve on Budget Oversight Committee, I'll hold back some of my questions. And I also think that there are so many of you here today that are here for future agenda items.And while the budget is the most exciting thing in most of our lives, I know that you have other important matters. So I'm going to get to the meat and potatoes of my quick questions. I appreciate the work of our fire department.I really appreciate going over the budget in detail, and I don't have any questions for you at this time. My questions are really going to be with the police department at this time. So first, I want to compliment you and the T.I department for the new platform of tracking crimes.I think that this has been a significant contribution to the community. I want to give a special thank you to Commander Herzog, who has since moved on from the East Division. He recognized the number of individuals in our communities that used to use the crime report tracking website and the major setbacks that it had.He took their input and worked hand in hand with community members who would identify specific inaccuracies on the website to try to identify as we moved into this new system, what caused those inaccuracies. And I think that accurate, important, accurate, transparent data for the community to know and be able to see their own crime stats is importantin communities taking ownership and making those calls when they see something that is suspicious. However, we've had some challenges with the Go Language P.D. app. I appreciate the Ericsson for getting that back online. As soon as our neighborhood association said that it was down.It is back up and running tonight. I really, really appreciate the ability for a community member to give their own police report. However, when we talk about adding non sworn to do that, I have some concerns in terms of costs and training.And so I'll bring back up what I brought up four years ago and three years ago and then I kind of gave up on for a while, but I'm back at it. We have 48 police officers scheduled to retire this year.We are we instituting a reserve program where they could come back to the city in a reserve capacity. Knowing and understanding the knowledge and information that they have from their years on the force where they could potentially take some of these community service officer.Non-emergency. Priority three. Focused. Immediate. The information on the new pilot program with notes on Councilwoman Mongo.We actually have several police officers who have retired and have become reserve officers now in our reserve program. They're slated to work. I want to say it's 10 hours a month and some special events because it's a volunteer assignment.Mm hmm. Not to me. Not too many people are going to volunteer to go out and become a report card. So that's a little bit of a challenge. So that's why we wanted to try this program. Again, we're just giving it a shot, see what works.We're open to any option that would reduce the police officers workload and have them do more priority type work.How many reserves do we currently have?Sorry about that. I'd have to get back to you on that. I want to say it's in the range of about 25 or 30.So I will ask that our Long Beach police officers who are considering retirement in the next 12 months or have retired over the last 12 months, I think in the next 24 months we have upwards of I don't even want to say eligible because it would scare us the numbers, but I would guess we've been averaging somewherebetween 30 and 40 to 50 a year. And so I would strongly encourage all of those reserves to do that. And then I would also encourage us to look at an opportunity where, in addition to your volunteer hours, other reserve agencies, after you meet your minimum requirements of your 10 hours, you can be on an hourly paidposition, which is at a significant reduction from what an hourly full timer would cost because they're already receiving their pension and they're already retired. They have to keep under their 960 hours unless they get an exemption depending on the agency from was ERA or I can't remember the acronym is for LAPD.But I hope that we will sit down and explore this as a opportunity because the ability for us to keep those individuals, so many of them are changing agencies and going back to work full time. And we just are missing out on that experience.They know the streets, they know the communities, they know the neighborhoods, they know the trends. Which leads me to my second question. I'm the big the. Investigations, Sergeant. Is it specifically burglary? I know Councilman Price mentioned a couple of different areas that it could have been in, but I don't think I heard what specific section the downgradedsergeant was coming from.Burglary.It is burglary. Okay. And is that an area where. We are caught up or behind in those investigations. I know that we have backlogs in lots of areas.We have backlogs in all of our investigative units.So that would concern me. I know that we want to clear these investigations because the sooner we get these individuals in jail, the better chance we have of less victimization. So I look forward to working with you and your department on what those opportunities are.I really just can't stress enough what a great outcome reserve programs have been, including you as our police chief, who started as a reserve. And I'm so proud of that and and the work that you did and and how you've led our department over these last few years.And so I hope that at least it's something that we can consider over the next several weeks, because 25 reserve officers I know that we had a a staff member in your office who ended up retiring, who was working on building that back up.And we had regular meetings. But as that staffing change happens, I know it's challenging. And so anything I can do to help and work with you and the team, I just feel so passionately that keeping these individuals with that level of experience on the team is so important.And with that, I will pass it off to the next council member, since I know it's a long meeting.Thank you. Thank you. Next Miss Universe. So thank you.My little lighthouse. I can't tell if it's on or off. Thank you. Have a very few. I'm not very. If you have very little to say. I think it's a great budget and it's wonderful. And I think that thanks to the citizens of Long Beach, they helped us basically get this budget that we have right now thatwe can really implement a lot of our programs and re and reintroduce others like my my colleague, Councilmember Mungo, who had no questions for fire. I do. And I had no questions from for PD budget a little bit.And I have just one for the master of disaster.In terms of fire, you didn't mention anything.About the research program, the Community Emergency Response Team. I was wondering, is that still in effect or I know we were challenged of a year ago or a couple of years back. I'm getting some funding for some emergency kits or some igloos for to store some emergency equipment.What's the status of that?Mr. Vice Mayor, Councilmembers Councilmember Urunga Yes. The program is still very much active. In fact, this past year we trained 155 additional adults in in basic cert programs. This program has has grown beyond just cert now. And we're now we're doing teenage cert and we do Spanish language cert classes.And the program is started to grow throughout the city. Jake Heflin, as you guys you guys all know Jake Heflin, he is our program manager for Year Program and it's thriving, doing very well. And this past week, I'm happy to report that we've got a number of young men and women in our community that come from challengedbackgrounds throughout the community. And all sorts of different situations have been put into what we're calling a fire core program. And they've gone out to the fire stations. They're riding along, they're getting firsthand experience on what it's like to be with the fire, the fire department and firefighters on a daily basis.But each one of those young men and women teenagers went through a 24 hour training class before we let them go right along with our firefighters. So, yes, the program is functioning at a high level. It's thriving, continuing to grow, and we anticipate it will continue to grow in popularity for years to come.That's that's great to hear because I know it's a very important community benefit that we have out there. And it really gets our our members of the community engaged with the city in terms of disaster preparedness and and being able to provide emergency response when we need it, which is a good segue way to my next question. A lot of us were already a lot of the questions that I had there was that we're asked by our customer representative. Thank you for being so astute with a lot of your questions regarding disaster preparedness. We great that one.The one aspect of your presentation that stood out to me was the cross training of the dispatchers. Could you go into a little bit more detail in terms of what does cross training entail in regards to their their performing their their jobs as dispatchers currently?Thank you, Councilmember. Currently, we have co-located dispatchers, police and Fire Hall located on the second floor of the Emergency Communications Operations Center and have been co-located with similar skill sets since that building was erected about 15 years ago.We've always identified. The potential to create some economies and skills as well as to be able to provide additional resources when we have large scale incidents that occur in the city, like a major fire, like the Paradise Gardens fire that we experienced a couple of years ago, or like some of the police activities that we've also experienced. So these are very similar disciplines. Staff are all accustomed to talking to telephone and doing radio work, some in code, some not in code. But we've had success with the dispatchers that we've been able to put through the training course.As I said, it provides a force multiplier for us when we have a large event. Our challenge in the cross training program is our need to continue is our need to answer all of the phone calls that we have as they're coming in.So an analogy that I use quite often is we have to keep this plane flying while we're trying to build another wing, and our priority is to keep the plane from flying. So we spend most of our time just bringing in new dispatchers, training them in one or the other, discipline, police or fire.And then as time and resources permit, then we go through some training on a cross-training program with other dispatchers. So we're about 20% of our dispatchers that have completed the training. They go back and forth between the two centers.If there's an influx of calls on one side, we will bring some cross training dispatchers in to assist as opposed to calling dispatchers from home to come in. So we have a much quicker response and it has paid dividends for us.Our priority, though, is, as I said, reducing overtime by bringing in by training dispatchers continuously on one discipline or another.Okay.Yeah, that's what I figured that cross-training was included because I would recall that there were actually two two sites, one for a fire in another location and one for police, which was down here in the basement of City Hall once upon a time.And so now with the the EOC establish out there, Redondo, it it creates a great opportunity to have these these two services put together. And the cross training is a is of course, a one of those benefits that the community would would greatly benefit from because of the level of service that would be expanded.So that's what I have. Mace Mary, you can wake up now.Thank you for the visit.You guys were losing our audience.You must answer.Mrs. Pierce.Here.My turn. Great.Oh, excuse me.Well, I want to say what a great budget it is. I think that the staff has done a fantastic job. And when I sat down and looked at it on the first day, I just kind of sat with it because it is such a different budget than the first budget that I was able to participate in passing. And so I just want to give a congratulations to all the staff that's worked really hard on this. I'm going to go the opposite direction. So let's talk about disaster preparedness. I want to first say how great it has been to work with your office.We have done some fantastic things. We've done some Facebook Live videos with your team, or we came in and did one around earthquakes and then we went to the aquarium and talked about tsunamis. And so my goal is hopefully to do one of those quarterly with your office and also with fire and PD.And so I just want to thank you for being willing to think outside the box and having your team like they come in with everything. So when we did the one for the earthquake, she brought in a whole box of goodies to show everybody all the little bitty things that you can do to make a difference thatnow my house is finally disaster ready. So I want to thank you for that. I did want to ask my staff, did the active shooter training in the main library last year, do you have plans for that training again in the next year?Thank you, council member. We appreciate your staff outreach to us to do some Facebook Live. We think, you know, as many other departments utilizing social media really helps us to get our message out. And especially in the area like disaster preparedness, where people don't really think about it much until something happens and at that point it's toolate. So it's great that we able to get out in front. And so we appreciate your participation there. Yes. Last year we did active shooter training with every department in the city. We did it with all of the council officers.We did it with the ranchos, with the with the museums. And we continue to offer those services to city departments that need it, council officers, turnover and staff. And we're happy to come back out and do those trainings.Wonderful. I have a hole about a three new people on my staff and I've got seven. A new intern. So I think we'll be calling you soon. I did have one other question. The current roles of the administration, bureau managers and disaster preparedness manager positions.What will change with them with the title change?Yeah, you know that that nothing will change with the title change. The title change better reflects the the magnitude of the job as opposed from an officer to a manager. But with our staff, we have the same we have the same responsibilities and administration as other departments have, sometimes on a smaller basis in some areas, sometimes greaterin some other areas. And so we are really, really fortunate that through a recruitment process, we were able to identify Diane Brown, had previous experience with the city, could hit the ground running and kept us all of our recruitment.Everything stayed on track.So great. Okay. I think that that's pretty much it will be outreaching again, like I said, to do a couple more activities with with your office and just really appreciate your efforts. And I am going to ask my staff that at the end of each of our signatures that we add to download the alert app on theirphones. And it did take me a while when I tried to do it, I couldn't multitask and do it, which I'm a pro at multitasking. So it took me a minute, but we're going to add that to the end of our signatures.And maybe if we could do that for the entire city, that might be a great step to get awareness out about that. Thank you very much. Okay. Let's go to let's see Chief Luna. I have several questions on PD and I'm going to try not to duplicate those that have already come up.And before I begin, I want to say when we looked at the budget and I saw the added quality of life officers, the bike officers, I was elated in my district where we have a it's a denser district than parts of the east side.We've had many requests, particularly in our business improvement district, for bike officers that are able to be more nimble. And so I if you could walk through for me where the bike officers will be, I see some metro, but what is the ability to have them in our beds, like the Dhaba Fourth Street and our beaches?It seems like an appropriate use on our beaches outside of the the trucks that we have. Yeah.Councilmember Pearce, the concept or the vision that we have for this rapid bicycle response team that's proposed is we wanted to get one sergeant and five police officers really available to the entire city. It would not be for just one area.The concept would be is that we put them on some type of whether it's a bicycle, motocross bicycle, put.Them on scooters.No scooters, no scooters, less DC he says yes, but we have some significant challenges throughout the city with not our homeless population but the criminals within the homeless population. And as most of you can attest to, they're on the beaches, in the flood controls, places that are very difficult for a police car to get into.So when this team gets put together, if it if it goes through, they'll figure out the type of vehicles to get into those areas. Their task would be to focus on the high frequency offenders, the people with extensive criminal histories that we see out on our streets within that population and the significant mentally ill.So that team would focus on that group and we believe it would reduce the numbers of crimes that are occurring within that population that is increasing our overall index crime, especially in the aggravated assault categories. We are having multiple incidences where the individuals I've described to you are either the suspects or the victims.This team can get to them and we believe would have an impact. But whatever the problems are anywhere in the city, that's where they would go.Great.Okay, let's see. And then I had a question on the quality of life officers. I know with the Hart team, you know, there's only so much that they can do with a quality of life officer. Do they have the ability to transport or do they have to call in somebody else if they have a situation where theyneed to take someone to the hospital or something like that.They transport themselves.They can.Yes, great. They do. And they do often.Okay. And I wanted to to talk about the community policing model. I remember my first budget, we talked about this and it was like we just don't have the capacity. We don't have the capacity to even talk about getting out of our cars and playing games with the community members.So I'm really happy to hear your comments tonight about that. And just wanted to highlight it's great to be chipping away and adding more officers each year to get us closer to that to that goal.If you follow us on social media, hopefully you do. You'll see a lot of our officers engaging, getting out of their cars, whether it's parks, neighborhoods. I'm hoping that through the clerk's office, they give you all the capes that we handed out on National.We've got capes.Yeah. And that's something our officers are doing every day, every night and really, really building relationships out there consistently.Great. Thank you for that. And following that question on community policing, what is the standard for keeping officers within their beat? How long do we typically shift somebody around or keep them.In patrol calls for service. It is currently a six month deployment. The officers get to choose based on seniority division shift days off and again, that's based on seniority. Some end up staying a lot longer than six months because they like where they work, but it gives people the opportunity to move around the city and do somedifferent things.So is there I know that in having some conversations with other cities and other jurisdictions where they have attempted to have people in the same community for two years or three years and that same area. So they're able to build that trust with with that population and really they're able to outreach them and build trust and nothaving to rebuild trust every six months. Is there any I mean, I'm not telling you how to do your job. And same thing with Susie Councilmember Price. You know, some advice on how do we continue to build that trust within our communities.Is there anything else keeping us from extending that time or encouraging people to stay longer?But it is something that we listen to. We look at best practices, not only in the region, around us, in the state and the entire country. And those are things that we assess. Each patrol division has what we call police resource officers, and they're there a little bit longer, depending on if there's movement, opportunity for promotion oropportunities for another bureau. But this is something that we believe works here for our city. It it works for our employees, but we're constantly reevaluating it to see if if we're having challenges in building trust in certain neighborhoods.We believe at this time this six month deployment is working for us, but we're never stuck in our ways. We always look at best practices.Okay. Thank you for that. And then you mentioned that we're running a lot on over time. I think I had a brief conversation with you in regards and maybe financial management can help us understand. I understand that the Tidelands funds could be used to pay for overtime in the Tidelands area.Is that something that one what would that look like and to is that something that would help? PD Particularly in our Entertainment Convention Center, I mean, the beach zone there, we I know we have a lot of challenges right there in our marina.So if you could walk through what that would look like using Tidelands funds for PD overtime.I'll start off and then if you need to add to that financial wizard yourself.However.We currently do use overtime from Tidelands to do exactly what you just described, and we've been doing that successfully. Generally, we get the support not only from all of you, but the city manager's office and financial management to be flexible in regards to retrieving funding, overtime funding from different funds.And although it's welcomed and it's effective. I'm really concerned about our capacity right now in overtime employee wellness, psychological well-being, making sure our employees are spending time with their own families so they are more productive at work. So those are all things we have to fine balance with.And that's the thing I talked about earlier is if at one point over time is just not the way we're going to get this job done, I have to come back to this council and say we are beyond our capacity and we may need more staffing, structural staffing increases.And I mean, I've said many times that I don't necessarily support overtime with our PD because I understand how stressful your job is. And so having a department that's all working overtime leads could possibly lead to, you know, situations in the field that we could deter if we didn't have officers working overtime.So I think what would be helpful for me and maybe it could be in front of this council or not too from for on how many overtime hours we have and what would it look like to fill those with with FTEs instead would be kind of helpful I think for us to understand, not necessarily in this budgetcycle, but for the next year for me to understand would be helpful. Did Financial have anything else to add?I believe that the police chief is correct that we are already using the overtime from Tidelands, but we will.Verify that and get back to you.I think that we are okay. And then one to last things for PD. I think that this morning we would we sent you an email, but I did go to a community meeting last night and I don't mean to put you on the spot, but one of the challenges that I've had in my district is that wehave transients or folks that are on drugs have a situation where they get violent or physical or cause a situation with another resident they call PD. And the gentleman last night I asked him to call to make sure that residents know that if they're not happy with the situation that they had, that they need to call andtalk to a supervisor in PD. So number one two is that when we have situations like having PD come out and they said we want to file a charge against this person, this homeless person that attacked me or whatever, that sometimes the officers will say, well, why do you want to do that?There's nothing we can really do. And that they feel. I've had three situations the last two months where they said they let the person walk away and the officer was said that they were on drugs or they were high.And so that's what we're grappling with with the beach challenge. And so how can we help knowing that we don't have room in our jails, knowing about Prop 47, what is a best practice for our constituents to understand and what they need to do whenever they do call police and they feel like they've been in a poorsituation?To let us know. I need dates and times. Yeah. If. If somebody alleges that one of our officers responded to the scene of an incident and they didn't perform their duties. I need to know. I need to follow up.Many times we get those type of allegations. Somebody stated it earlier. We'll check with our communications center. Everything's taped. And if I've learned anything in the last three years of my career is there's two sides, every story. So we get both sides and we figure out what happened.And many times people do get frustrated because they call the police. And when we get out there, we find that no crime has been committed. And and obviously, you know, there's sometimes we can do something. But taking a crime report, you don't take one unless a crime was committed.But it's still our obligation to explain to somebody what what we're doing and why and explain from that perspective. And we have great employees, but once in a while we do make a mistake. And if we do, we'll correct it.Great. Thank you for that night. That was exactly what I told community members last night. But I know that I had a room of 30 people that are watching at home right now. So I wanted to have it not just come from my mouth, but have it come from yours as well.And my very last thing for PD is back to the airport. I wanted to understand what is what are the staff that are there now and what would be the change, having them underneath you versus the airport? And is there a cost differential there?There is some cost differential for the exact numbers. I would need some assistance from financial management there. But in regards to the responsibilities being under the police department, it just completely changes the dynamics. Our training standards, our expectations are just very much different than what they've had in the past.And that's not to say I mean, it's a great group of people. They've been doing a good job. We just believe being in our chain of command, they would do that that much better and they would perform. From a safety perspective, making the airport a lot safer than it is now.Can you. Has there been a situation or something that's happened that's been a red flag or is it just trying to create a different atmosphere?A little of both.Okay. I'll leave it there and we can check in before the budget processes are final as well. So that's all I have for you, Chief Luna. A fun. I didn't promise a short one, so I've got a fire next.I just want to say with fire, I'm extremely happy that in the last budget we were able to make the Hart team structural. They were adding a second Hart team. I love that we're adding 17, you know, crossing fingers.So I have two big questions for you. One is, I know that the Hart team cannot transport, and I know that we've had conversations with Janice Hahn. We've talked at the state level. Is there can you give us a status update on where we are in giving the the Hart team the ability to to transport?Councilmember the that the intent of the program was to never have the Hart team transport. If you go back a couple of years when we first put the program in place as a pilot program, we were figuring it out.It proved to be very successful. So we, the council structurally funded it last year. One of the things I brought up during last year's budget presentation was ultimately down the road. We'd like to get to a place where we go to L.A. County Emergency Medical Services Agency and make that resource response capable under the 911.So that's what I meant, right?So it's not or it's not the the rig itself is not configured to transport first responders. So we are still in the process of debating and discussing how we should best approach that. I will tell you this. The Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services Agency has already told us that adding another resource into the system is noproblem, provided that has the right tools and equipment on it to meet the criteria that they call out. The question we're dealing with internally is the mission of the Hart team has proved to be very successful and we continue to grow the program and it's morphing.And the Joel Davis and Justin Berger, the two firefighter paramedics that are on that are teaching us really about what that program should be. And so we have to be very careful as we move forward not to take them away from their core mission.So I do like the idea of having them become a response capable unit that for surge protection or overflow or those situations where we're just out of resources, we could dispatch the Hart Unit, maybe an A and an ambulance to transport somebody, but we have to do it in a very measured and deliberate way to make surethat we are not on a daily basis taking them away from from their mission. Yeah, because their mission is important and they're making a difference on the things they're doing right now.That is very helpful. Thank you for that. And I love that they're doing the trainings with everybody. I'm just really thrilled with how you guys have taken it and really been measured and slow at moving it to make sure it's the right fit.Also, I think the same thing that Councilmember Susie Price mentioned planned small business has been a key part of my term and I think that as much as we can do to open those doors quicker and so adding an additional staff for that, the electronic system is wonderful.So that's really what I have for you guys. I'm just really thrilled. And oh, I did have one more question. I know that you guys have a list we don't like to talk about all the time. Downtown Long Beach is growing our residents by 3000, we have station one.We have some improvements around the Queen Mary. If you could just talk about fire for me in downtown and what that looks like not only with our new residential units, but we are adding potentially three new hotels. What does it look like to reassess kind of the needs for first responders and downtown.Councilmember Yes, that's an ongoing discussion we have in our Fire Prevention Bureau. And to your point, as I mentioned earlier, our fire prevention bureau, I think I'm biased, of course, but I think we're the best in the business around the state of California.We take a very proactive approach with our business community to get them to a yes where we want them to do what they. Want to do. We want them to do it in a safe and productive way. We constantly evaluate the downtown, the entire city, really.But the density in downtown is a constant topic of discussion and fire prevention. No more in in this area of the city are things that there's no no more sprawl. Now, we're going vertical with the density. Right instead of the response times have always been calculated in the fire service from the fire station to the address.But now we have to take into account not only to go from the fire station to the address, but you also have to go up 24 hours to get to wherever the issue may be.Or 34.In some cases. Yeah. So we are we are evaluating that scenario on a regular basis to make sure that we're doing what we can to augment our resource responses to the downtown environment. Secondarily, going back to fire prevention or Fire Prevention Bureau has been really good, as are all the developers that are coming to town and usingthe latest materials and the latest fire suppression systems really to try and minimize the incidence of a conflagration or fires happening. Not to say they won't happen and they're just meant to hold them in check until we get there.But our fire prevention, working in concert with the development community, working in concert with our operations folks, are talking about these things and crunching the numbers. And you said earlier our list, I believe you're referring to the list, the restoration priority list.And certainly if we ever got there, if we were fortunate enough to find the funding for Engine 17, we would certainly look very hard. Our next resource on that list is Engine one, two, one, or we would have have a discussion there.So we'll continue that discussion and do everything we can to minimize the potential impacts of density.Great. I want to thank all three of you for your leadership. Everybody on your teams. Rank and file people that do the hard work every single day. I appreciate you guys. I know sometimes we have tough public conversations and sometimes put each other in difficult situations, but know from the bottom of my heart, my constituents, we appreciateyou guys and we're going to continue to push to make sure that we remain the best that we can be and just really. Thank you.Thank you. Congressman Soprano.Thank you. My comments will be very brief. I just have one question. But to paraphrase Reggie Harrison, we've got to keep this council meeting flying and I'm afraid the wings might fall off so long. So no questions for the director of disaster preparedness or Police Chief Luna.But Chief Theresa, you probably want to know the topic I want to bring up here, and that's Engine ten. You're supposed to be shocked. Okay.Now, actually, the first image you had in your.Presentation was a photograph of Engine ten, but it was sitting out in front of Station 17. And that just struck me because.Engine ten occupied Station 17, while Station ten was.Being remodeled and you had the same thing for Engine 22 was that 17 while Station 22 is being remodeled. So I just realized since we've had Engine 17 and mothballs, Station 17, it's kind of been the Airbnb of the Language Fire Department.So I'm really looking forward to.The restoration of Engine 17, so it won't have that distinction anymore. The one question I do have, Chief, is we asked this of you a couple of years ago. Once, if this council pulls the trigger on this restoration, how long would it take you to get that engine company in service?Would it be a matter of hours, days or weeks?I can't remember the I will give you the standard response. I tell every every one of our our council members and our mayor. If you ask how long it would take me to turn the resource on in town, I can have it in service tomorrow morning at 8 a.m..But the reality is that the smart reality would be for us probably after the first of the year, so we can plan for it. We'll have another academy that will graduate and we won't have the staffing issues that we might have if we turned it on tomorrow.So we'd give us a little bit of time to get it up and going. But functionally, we're uniquely well positioned that we can establish a response profile anywhere in the city very, very quickly. But I would say probably January 1st would be a time that we would shoot for to make it an effective transition.Okay. Thank you. Great to have you all tonight.Thanks you through, Mr. Zuber. No. Councilman Salvador.I'm okay.Councilman Richardson.Thank you, Councilman. Vice Mayor. Andrews. A couple of things. So first, having seen a number of budgets, it's a good budget. It's a budget that doesn't require a bunch of scrutiny, but rather, I think, you know, this is a budget that allows us to kind of imagine vision, what the future looks like, and that's really refreshing.So first Chief Tory, so I noticed you mentioned a challenge for you was increasing diversity in the department and and I know that that's been a commitment of yours since you've become chief. I've seen the evidence, but I think it's great that you will step up and actually acknowledge that we have to do more.And I've heard the same from the rank and file. So what are some of the tactics you envision sort of deploying as you ramp up for this next academy? Well, Councilmember.The question for US centers, not so much about the command staff. My teams will or our intent to diversify the organization when we have the opportunity to do that. Well, what we want to focus on is we are literally only as good as the people who show up to take our exam or the people who end upon our list. Right. The list that we get from civil services eligible, that's that's what we select from. So we want to we want to take it a step farther. We want to we want to actually get into that how that list is created.How are these people being provided the opportunity or the knowledge that the opportunity exists for them? And what are we doing as an organization, a fire department? And I'll give Candace in civil service a lot of credit. She wants to partner with us on this so that we we can we can create new modes and methods ofactually getting these people in our community that represent our community to come take this exam and be successful in the process. So we're fortunate we have a management assistant that's going to be rotated through fire a little bit later on into the year.And we believe we're going to we're going to hand her the keys, really. And we believe that she's going to produce a really deep dove to figure out where those issues are and and really set us on a course that we can change some things.And I just want to say this. I've said this for years, but for me, as the fire chief in the city, diversity is not a numbers game, it's an inclusion game. So I want to make sure that we're creating a safe and inclusive environment for anybody in our community that wants to become a firefighter.And that at that point, we're also providing them all the opportunities they need to be successful. So I think if we look at it from a pure numbers standpoint, we're missing the opportunity to actually create an inclusive, diverse workforce.And that's what we want to focus on.I enjoy that. You use the words inclusive and diverse and and I agree they're more than buzzwords, I think is the recipe for success. If you see the the trend line of the demographics of our city and we just saw another agency in Metro, they embrace this early and they're thriving, successful.I think we should play to our strengths. And in my opinion, that means when you get this management assistant less and less, engage Lumbee City College a bit more. I think, you know, there's an there's you know, there's real opportunities for us to, you know, continue to develop a real pipeline leveraging lobby, City College.And it will help our enrollment at the college, but also allow us to better engage the community because we don't have to do this alone. We have this apparatus here that we need to utilize more. So that's just a recommendation.And then and also, you know, this fall, we should receive a report from policy link on our economic inclusion strategies in a piece. There may be some some national best practices on how to engage or better engage the local community.So I look forward to sort of just playing with that, this concept with you a little bit over the course of the next year. I obviously support the restoration of 12. I mean, of 17 I saw the impact when 12 were restored.And, you know, I've said and I'll continue to say it, we saw three minute diminished cut in the response times in North Palm Beach. And, you know, the more resources put in the play, it supports better, stronger response times across the city.So you have my complete support there. Just a question on GMT. How does that come in? I know that you were in the process last budget, last few budgets on implementing that and getting the tablets and all that.How's that coming along? The GMT funding and process?Councilmember The GMT program is up and running. We submit an annual cost report to CMS's Center for Medicaid Services through the State of California. And we are I'm I'm trying to recall, but I believe we're budgeted and I think we're bringing it about a little over $1,000,000 million to.1.1 $1.2 million a year into the system. So it's proving to be successful so.Far and there's still potential for that to increase. Right. Are we not artificially optimized there or what?Yes, sir. Currently we believe we are fully optimized at this point. There could be some changes that come through the GMD program in fiscal year 19 that could could provide us some different avenues for revenue out of that program.But it remains to be seen whether the federal government will change the guidelines.Thank you. Well, I'm pleased with the job that you guys are doing. And, you know, one thing I'll just I'll just offer not operations related, but our beautiful new station 12. When you take a look the landscaping a little bit, it's a I don't know if the drought or some sprinklers are broken, but looks like we're goingto have a replace probably like two thirds of the plants that.That is that is super drought tolerant vegetation.All right. They're not that tolerant, then. Well, thanks a lot. Chief Lula, just you have a lot to be proud of. I'm glad to look at your accomplishments and as very visible work, particularly. I see you called out the diversion work, the lead diversion work on Long Beach Boulevard.And I know that that's grant funded and they're doing a fantastic job actually engaging with the residents in the businesses and they know the officer by name, but I know with grant funded. So when do we anticipate that grant to end?Two years from now.Two years. Okay. So I, you know, I'd like to think about. I know there's a lot of activity there in terms of like, you know, motel conversion, other work. I'd like to think of like a transition plan to set some goals on the, you know, on the planning side and on the development side for things we cantangible things we can see on that corridor when that program goes away. So. So we're well aware of what resources we have, which resources we don't have a lot of Beach Boulevard, and we could see some tangible improvement.And and in addition to that, and he's just come it's not really a question. Just just comments and thoughts. Um, I'm glad to see the quality of life officer deployed in North Long Beach. Are they going to be is the lead off is that that's more of this doing that right after the more.I believe it's more that.Officer Commander's been identified. Detectives is the one working on the crime that probably he was talking about.Look, some more is doing lead. So is this person are they going to work together because it's really the same corridor where you have the majority of the problems related to human trafficking and homelessness? Yes. Okay. So so that said, I want to I want to start a conversation with you this year.And it's just an idea, I mean, kicking around a talk with Councilman Austin about it and talk to some others, the idea is and it's not really a new idea, but I want to reintroduce it. But the idea is maybe look at the Focus on Zombies Boulevard or perhaps the new community center, Highland Park, and think aboutestablishing a community policing center, which is essentially the new quality of life officer the staff from the lead program that's handling human trafficking, the resource officer and our business district security staff, and sort of having sort of a focal point.You know, we have the North Station at the Alamo, but we don't have anything in the actual nine or 805 zip code. And I think that's it could be interesting for us to explore that for a number of reasons.Number 190805 zip code is growing by population four times the rate of the citywide population growth statistic. And you know, with with these recent opportunities that we have, I think we should think about what that might look like.We think about that, Chief.Worth exploring.Okay. Well, quite an endorsement, but we'll look forward to continuing that conversation and look forward to continue that conversation. And but overall, this is a this is a good budget master disaster. Mr. Harrison, I got to tell you, you know, you're always I mean, you've come engage with our North Lambie's executive leadership, our leadership council.And, you know, you and your staff and the police dispatch have done a good job really addressing a lot of the concerns. I have no really no concerns and just encouragement that we want to continue the conversation we've had with the North Miami Beach community and your office.So thank you for your hard work and look forward to continuing to engage with you.Thank you.Thank you.Next up, we have Councilman Alston.Thank you. And I'm going to really be brief. I want to just just commend all of our public safety. I think the presentation was great. The budget is, I think, sound and one that I think takes into account all of our needs.Certainly we could have more officers and use more officers, more firefighters, more more resources. But I think we're we're moving in the right direction. And I commend city manager and the department heads, both chiefs, for for for putting together a sound budget.I do have a couple of questions. Number one, for emergency disaster preparedness. Mr. Harrison, in the the budget, it talks about key measures and the number of public safety dispatcher candidates process for recruitment. And I'm looking at a a decline from 2017 when you had 244.And then in FY 17. And here in Fy19, you have 150. Why is that? And can you talk about your recruitment and retention of dispatchers? Well, we are with that. We have the public safety dispatchers is one of only two other jobs in the city that has aa1 year probation.One being police, the other being fire and public safety dispatchers. We go through a process. It's a one year probationary process. So depending on where we are, we bring in candidates off of the off of the hiring list.And we populate our center with our training staff and then we go through a one year process. And so we have an elasticity of a certain amount of dispatchers that we can handle during a 12 month period of time.And so we're going to go through some ebbs and flow as we have, you know, we're staffed up, trainers have out there at capacity. So they can't take additional dispatchers off the off the list. It's really pretty much as simple as that.And then the job of a dispatcher, you know, we kind of describe it as multitasking on on steroids. It is a challenging job for many of the dispatchers. It's a rewarding job for all of the dispatchers. But it is a job that's detail oriented.It is a job that takes all of the concentration that an individual has. And it is a job that takes all of that 12 month probationary time to actually be able to master and graduate out of that program.And so how many dispatchers do we actually employ? We are budgeted for, I believe, 75 dispatchers. We did some reorganization last year in recognition of the cross training as an incentive to be able to pay those dispatcher that have completed cross training so that they could receive additional income with that skill.So we had to do some reorganization, as I recall, with about at 75, I believe, with what we have. I'm looking at 81 in emergency communications, but that's close. So so with that many people coming to training, I mean, how many folks are actually sticking with the department?It's a challenging it's a challenging job. Council member it really is an across the board, across the board nationwide. So it's not just an issue for for Long Beach. We will have on average a 40% graduation rate with our dispatchers for a variety of reasons, for a variety of reasons that people, you know, they they come inwith their own concepts of what dispatching is all about. And, you know, and then they're then there's a certain reality that sets in in terms of what the job is. Dispatchers are really busy. They're moving from one station to another.The calls that they take, they paint a picture for first responders in the field. They can see visually because of the series of questions that they're asking, pretty much exactly what a first responder is going to see when they arrive on scene.And sometimes that experience is a little bit more reality than some people feel comfortable with. I thank you for explaining that. I really appreciate that. And I ask that question because oftentimes it's the support staff that don't get get recognized for for some of the really important work that they're doing.And so we appreciate those dispatchers as well. The next question I have is for Chief Luna, and I'm also looking at the support bureau numbers here. And while I'm looking at the the F y 18 FTE numbers, it looks like there's 256 at this point, five in the support bureau, and it moves up to 286.And I'm trying to figure out which is that is that the proposed move to bring the assessors from the airport into the Department Support Bureau.That would be the 27 assessors. It would also include the body pick up, the intended proposed body pick up from Metro. Metro Blue Line is under our support bureau. Okay.My last point is the great job. Then all the way around. I think the budget is sound. I would just influence upon Army Chief and commander in the North Division to keep the North Station open for 4 hours, if as much as possible, because that is a a resource that I know our residents out there truly, trulydepend on. It's great to have a police station. You know, it's really frustrating when when people go to the police station and they can't make contact with an officer when the doors are closed and not open. And I know we rectified that work to to to have those those doors of that police station open of, you know, at least a certain amount of hours every day. But I would just ask that you you continue to focus on on making the public or keeping the North Station accessible to the public for for for those those type of calls and situations where where people really need to touch the PD for many years.And I'll just say this was before I took office. I think the police station was closed for several years and people there was a sign on the door and said, hey, you know, if you need to to talk to somebody, go downtown.Right. That's a that's a huge if convenient for anybody be is for anybody living in the north part of the city and for the resource to be there. I just want to emphasize that, you know, it's good to be able to make contact with what the public safety officer, the police officer for our public.So thank you very much. Looking forward to to another year of great public safety all the way around.Thank you, gentlemen.Thank you very much. I do have some some comments and then a one suggestion by Senator Jeff. Sorry, I didn't see up there. Let me go to Vice Mayor Andrews first. You go first. I have your.Name of a mine so.That I see first of my.Yeah, I've been kind of sleeping on the job, so I'm glad you came back.Here and.We're back. Okay. First of all, I want to start out by saying, you know, I agree with councilwoman, you know, Price, that we do need to take a second look at the employees reduction because I'm very, very happy to see the quality of life, you know, for officers added to the West Division.You know, I'm looking forward to these officers, you know, coming to my monthly briefing, you know, and neither the police or the I need you know, I need the police or the fire budget. Did I see fireworks prevention, enforcement, you know, outreach.Notice that as a key service. And I did not see any specific line item for this. I know that the conversation about this has been a priority, and we want to do it. We want these efforts to be proactive as well as reactive.And I'm hoping is somewhere in the budget we have allocated funds, you know, for this issue, you know, and anyway, I think the South Division stations is doing a great job to keep up the good work, you guys.And for the last question, I, I will I will add any you know, I want to know what any of the airports, you know, as as as always, do they lose any authorities or rankings with the proposed budget change?Vice mayor? I don't believe so. I will double check and get back to you.Thank you, sir. Okay. In last, I'd like to leave this to Reggie. You know, I won't use that word because I know what a great job you guys are doing. But that's a prevention emergency communication. You know, I need a lot about you know, I've heard a lot and continue about the outreach and the social media informationmaterial and access to the deaf and the blind residents that we have. But what about those that first language? You know, if it's not English, are they reaching out to those communities as well?Yes, Vice me. I'm glad that you asked that question. We have we have all of our outreach material, which is all translated into the various languages that our language act requires. Additionally, we our emergency messages are quickly translated for our speech impaired vision impaired residents so that we send out American Sign Language videos almost simultaneous to theEnglish language. This third party provider also provides Spanish language interpretations pretty quickly as well simultaneously. So we believe that on a countywide basis, the city of Long Beach is at the forefront in terms of that kind of outreach into those diverse neighborhoods.Not to say that there is more that we could do and we'd be happy to work with you and your district and some additional outreach. But in terms of getting messages out quickly and concise and consistent, we're able to accomplish that.I want to thank you for really recognizing that, because I have so much, you know, diversity in my area and, you know, in your team. You know, we realize it's key when people call 911, you know, are we having a mass emergency?I would like to be sure that all this information is reaching out to everyone. So many thank you guys for everything you do. And thank you.Thank you, Vice Mayor. I want to I want to make some comments. And then I do have an ask of the Budget Oversight Committee at the end of the comments. I want to I want to thank, obviously, the staff for making their presentation.I've heard this presentation I was mentioning to Mr. Lester, I think many, many times it seems like ten or so as we've been developing the budget. And so I it's good to have it out for public comment. And I want to mention a few things, some of which were referred to earlier tonight by some of the councilmembers. In 2014, when when this council, as we sit up here, was formed, we had 803 police officers and 406 firefighters. The current budget proposal allocates the funding if four restorations are made to 851 police officers and 431 firefighters.So certainly an increase of both police and firefighters over the course of the last four years. The restorations up to now have included Engine eight and Belmont Shore Rescue 12 and North Long Beach, the Hart unit that we're talking about this year, Engine 17 and East Long Beach, the restoration of South Division, the creation of the newMetro Division as part of the Metro Blue Line, which we know was part of our Metro contract for new quality of life officers and a six person bike officer team, which is part of this year's budget in addition to the growing of these departments.We're also investing, of course, in infrastructure and technology as it relates to police and fire, and that includes modernizing the both of the police and fire academies. That's in this year's budget, the upgrading of Long Beach PD and fire technology, including radio and communication systems, the funding of body cameras, which was I think mentioned earlier by CouncilwomanPrice, and the purchasing of modernized cameras across the city as it relates to the COPS system, which is our camera. I don't know that that's the acronym, but it's our camera system that we have across the city. So these are some significant investments.And I want to thank the Council for for making all of these which were really we're really grateful of. I also want to mention that we are committed to all of these restorations as outlined in the proposals today.But one issue has come up. I mentioned this to Mr. West. I've been talking to some folks, and I want to make sure that this gets addressed. It's been mentioned actually a few times tonight. I know in the F 19 budget, we have the reduction of the one sergeant position that's going down to an officer position.We know that the position has been identified as a sergeant that's assigned to a burglary detail. That's right. Chief Luna. That's correct. That's correct. And we know from what I understand and just talking to a few of the members of our police team, this is a sergeant that's kind of responsible for vetting, assigning and prioritizing theft casesin the city. Correct.Burglary and theft, yes. Okay.And so I know that this is a busy section of the department. And I also know that part of this part of the proposal we have in front of us is to possibly combine the burglary detail with auto theft with auto theft auto under one, sergeant, is that correct?Yes. Okay. Thank you. So, you know, and again, in just and in the budget, a moving you know, it's it moves and evolves as we move along. So I'd like to request tonight that the Budget Oversight Committee take up the it take up this issue and not reduce.Police sergeant position to the officer position. I think others have shown interest in this already on the council tonight. And so if I can make that request to the Budget Oversight Committee as we move forward, I think that the position in this case should not be downgraded to an officer position.So I think we need to keep it as a sergeant. And so, Mr. Mango, I'll leave that to you and to the BBC. But that's something I think that we've heard is going to be important. And so with that, I want to close my comments on on police, fire and disaster preparedness and Councilman Mangle.Yet an additional comment.I just wanted to take a moment to think and recognize the number of budget staff that are here tonight. I know you were only at the the midway point before we get to see the most exciting budget that I believe in, which is the CIP budget.But I know it's a long night and I know months and months of work went into all of the preparation that each of you do to make this book a reality and to make it possible for these department heads to sit before us and and say the words that you wrote for them.So thank you so much.And then Miss Mango, you'll take your you and the committee will take a look at that position.Absolutely.Okay. Excellent. Good. Well, with that, I'm going to open it up. What we're going to do is we're only halfway through our budget presentation. We're skipping next. So I want to take public comment on this portion of the budget presentation, which is safety.So if you have a public comment on this on on the police, fire or disaster preparedness only, please come forward on this part of the budget. Yes, sir.Members of the Council, I'll be very brief.My name is Renee Castro.I'm director for community engagement at Century Village. Is that Cabrillo? Of course. We provide housing for 1500 formerly homeless individuals, over 700 veterans, 600 children.And of course, that kind of huge operation requires.The collaboration with police fire, of course, development services and of course, our Health and Human Services Department. But recently I will really.Highlight our partnership.With the Emergency Communications and Operation Center. ECAC really want to thank Reggie Harrison for the incredible training they.Did for all of our partners. We had over 15.Partners who went to the CAC and we had a training on 911 and dispatch and it was incredible. So just.Wanted to highlight Reggie.And all of his work. Thank you very much.Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.Good evening. My name is Richard Suarez. I'm with the International Association.Of Machinists and Aerospace.Workers. I represent employees working in both the police department, the CISOs at the airport, and folks working at the Emergency Preparedness Department. I stand before you this evening because I believe that some information was shared with this council that does not reflect the accuracy of what we have out on the field.In the deepest department, we have approximately 18 trained fire folks and 30 trained police officers excuse me, police dispatchers. It was mentioned that about 20% of that number is cross utilized when in.Reality there's only one.Or two folks that can answer both the police and the fire phones and about five that can only answer the.Fire phone.So 20% is a figure that that's not realistic with the folks that are there. Now, in addition to that, we spoke about overtime and about stress on the job. These are the only folks in the entire city that the M.O. you excludes them from a free from duty period.Every employee in this city has an eight hour free from duty period at the negotiating table. Three years ago, the city would not agree to give that same level of relief to the men and women who.Answered 911 calls.For the last four and a half years since I've been here, there has been mandatory overtime in this department every single week. People are forced to work overtime every single week. So when we talk about reductions in cost, we have an issue here.The social situation at the at the airport is severe and grave. They the chief said that there will be no change in authority when in fact, their level one training, their post training has been taken away. They will no longer.Be post trained.They will keep their there and they realize that the time is short here. And I would invite to meet with each and every one of you in your offices. But perhaps Councilwoman Mungo, who has a experience in law enforcement, knows the importance of this.Level one training with the police department is attempting to do is to put them through a ten day home made training here in Long Beach, not send them to Rio Hondo, not send them to the police academy. None of that.And this is concerning on many levels. Right now we're speaking about 27 SOS. There aren't 27 SOS at the airport. There's less than half of that. There's 13 of them. And we have had these openings for years. So I believe that by design, there is an attempt not to staff properly.There's 13 men and women who protect this airport. There has been no deficiencies in the security detail. What they're proposing to do is to fill these positions up with police officers at a significantly higher cost than what an SSL makes a cop out, so makes about $30 an hour.Almost double for the top out, officer.Thank you. Thank you very much for source. We'll be happy to get together and chat about that. Yes, I trust you.Thank you, sir.Jim Foster, president of the Long Beach Police Officers Association. I come to thank you, Mr. Mayor, for your recommendation to take a second look at that sergeant position in burglary at your continued support of public safety for all of us.I also want to extend my thanks.To the Budget Oversight Committee, chaired by Councilwoman.Mangal and Councilwoman Pryce. Your questions today.This burglary.Position is the central node within the.Department where all of our property crime really filters through. This expert who manages all of that property crime throughout the city is the best advice giver to the upper leadership on how we should give our resources out to stop property crimes.So this this one position to me was very important to try to retain.To keep my employees who are working there properly managed.But I do appreciate.That's taking another look at that because I think somewhere in the budget we're going to be able to try to find the funding to keep this position. It really affects the entire city, not just a small portion. So thank you, sir.Thank you, Mr. Foster. And the next speaker? No. Oh, yes. Please come forward.Dave Shukla on file. I'd just like to thank the Mayor City Council for this budget. Specifically the emphasis on public safety and disaster and emergency preparedness. I recently was trained a couple of weekends ago at the fire department.It was a great experience.Very, very useful. And I look.Forward to not only continued support, but expansion along with diversion. Other programs for civilians can not only get skills but be of use in the storms to come.For next year, I'd love to see.More specifically about climate change. Thank you.Thank you. That concludes this part of the budget hearing. I want to thank everyone that spoke and police and to our police fire to that preparedness team. Thank you all. I know that this is a hefty week, but as a reminder, this is also seven almost 70% of our total budget.And so these questions and this discussion tonight is very important. So thank you. So we're going to go into our second half of the budget presentation tonight, which is on CHP, which is on infrastructure, which is I told them I told Mr. Beck and others this is my favorite presentation of the year when it relates to thebudget. It's all about our streets and our park projects and our infrastructure improvements all across the city. And and again, a lot of great news as it relates to Missouri and our CHP program and everything that's in this presentation.And I would encourage the council to really kind of deep I mean, do a do a deep dove and take a look at all the great projects that are being proposed. And so thank you for that and we'll turn this over.Mr. West, did you have any opening comments before we turn this over to Mr. Beck?Yes, Mayor. This is a huge, huge undertaking. The Capital Improvement Project, a lot of time and energy has gone into this, and we want to review it with all of you. It includes measure A, it looks at the entire 50 square miles.And I can't say enough about the entire team on the presentation that you're going to see right now. So I am going to turn this over.To our public works director, Craig Beck.And his team to present the capital improvement program for fiscal year 19. Craig.Thank you, Pat. Good evening, Mayor. City council and community members viewing this presentation. We're here tonight to discuss the city's capital improvement program, sometimes called KIPP for short. It provides the city's infrastructure investment plan for the coming year.The following presentation will detail proposed funding for the design, construction and maintenance of citywide infrastructure, which is the building blocks for a great city. As you can see, the fiscal year 18 cap budget, which is this year, is comprised of different funding sources that equal about $96 million.These funds support many different projects and are organized in our recipe book in six different categories. As identified on this page. They are mobility, public facilities. Parks and recreation. Beaches and marinas. Airports and utilities. Some of the major accomplishments that we would like to highlight for this year is our new sixth Street Bike Boulevard, a very importantEast-West connection across the city. Our Admiral Kidd Artificial Turf Sports Field and the city decided to use safe caulk and sand fill as opposed to recycled tires. Our Rainbow Bridge at Seaside Way. This is a great connection between our Terrace Theater and Convention Center.A new Harvey Milk Park refresh, which continues to have other improvements happen and will conclude with a new outdoor office function and our ongoing citywide paving projects. So what is our investment plan for fiscal year 19? It's about $120 million.This represents a $24 million increase over the current year, and that's driven primarily by two significant changes. First, the water department is planning to invest $30 million into pipeline replacement projects for both sewer and potable water. That's a $14 million increase over what they've committed in fiscal year 18.And I also want to highlight that the city is receiving new transportation dollars from the SB one gas tax funding. That $8 million that we're going to get from SB one is going to support 11 new street projects in the city just in fiscal year 19.So how do we plan to spend that $120 million? You see the six different categories here. I'm going to go through each of them in more detail. And first, since I'm wearing my new blue tonight, I want to highlight mobility.And I really appreciate our partners from Metro being here this evening talking about all the wonderful projects that they're doing in the city. And those are just some of the high profile projects that they highlighted this evening. There's a number of different partnerships that the city is working on with Metro, and we look to continue many ofthe great things that we do. So how does a city approach mobility? We do something which is called a complete streets. So what we're looking at is what type of improvements need to happen, and we want to look at that in their entirety.So, for example, does a street need to have new curb ramps added or do trees need to be trimmed? Are there broken sidewalks it should be addressed? Or is the street part of the citywide bicycle master plan? A good example of this approach in how we build out new streets is Bellflower Boulevard.If you haven't driven on it recently, I encourage you to do so. Not only is there brand new paving on Bellflower, but we also addressed much needed sidewalk repair and added protected bike lanes as this is a key connection point for riders going to Cal State, Long Beach Go Beach.So this year, all in all, we've added about 17 miles of bicycle lanes and we're adding those for all residents 80 to 80. This further enhances the city's livability efforts to provide alternative to single occupancy vehicle trips. That's bad.So mobility, $51 million plan for fiscal year 19. There's three major corridor projects that we're going to engage, including Market Anaheim, which is a pedestrian safety corridor project, and Artesia, which is a Great Streets project that we're coordinating through Skaggs and our adjacent cities.We also continue our investment in repaving our dirt alleys. We were able to accomplish about 1.6 miles of paved dirt alleys in fiscal year 18, and we look to replicate that in 19. And we'll finish paving all dirt alleys in fiscal year 20.That's our plan. Lastly, staff is recommending that council look at adding money to sidewalks while we prioritized our traditional sidewalk investment for new curb ramps as specified in our accessibility settlement. We think it's also important to address path to travel and similar to the action that council took in fiscal year 18, where $1,000,000 is allocated for sidewalksand divided by need among the nine council districts. We're recommending that that happen again and actually increase that number to 2 million. Again, divided throughout all nine council districts by need. So I love to highlight this map. This is a great picture.This map shows the city's five year street investment plan. And in particular, I want to highlight the Green Street segments. So those Green Street segments are streets that have already been completed or that will be completed by the end of this year.And that's almost 50% of our planned work. Now, granted, many of these streets were slurry and we were able to get those down a little quicker. But it really represents the great investment that we're making and the great progress that we've made to date.Still, we have many important projects ahead. So this map here is showing our street investment plan for the next two years, fiscal year 19 and fiscal year 20. Last year, council asked for a forward looking snapshot and staff is trying to provide that, showing two years of planned street work.My goal next year when I bring CIP to this council is I'll provide a snapshot for three years of street work. That's what we're working towards as a team and we hope to deliver that to this council and the community.So I'd like to shift to public facilities. For public facilities, there is a plan to invest $16 million. This will further some of the key projects completed in fiscal year 18, including workplace privacy improvements at Fire Station seven and ten.Also upgrades to our Expo Community Center in Bixby Knolls. So fiscal year 19 will include work at our public safety buildings, at the Fire Department Training Center and the police department west substation. We're also identified a number of city libraries for new roofs to ensure that those facilities don't leak.Assuming we get some weather this coming winter and also major renovations for our north health facility in Halton Park, this is a complete redo of that facility. For Parks and Recreation. This category we see some of the, I'll say, fun projects that the community gets to enjoy.In Bixby Park there is a new dog park added this year. The red car greenbelt next to Colorado lagoon is a wonderful walking path with native plantings and this just happened recently. It was very exciting to see, but a signature themed playground was opened at Lo Cerritos Park and we have Vets Park, Drake Park and Whaley ParkPlaygrounds coming real soon, and we should be delivering those within the next 90 days. Priority projects for fiscal year 19 include the restoration of the Eldorado Duck Pond. This is a high priority project that we're glad we're able to get to.And also Davenport, what we're calling phase two, which is really the buildout and activation of the greenspace from the former landfill closure. So moving to beaches and marinas. Fiscal year 19, we're going to be able to address the junior lifeguard station at 55th place.Also, there's an exciting new concept for the Alamitos Beach concession stand, which we hope to bring the council within the next few months for approval to move forward. This will add to the fantastic amenities completed this year at Bayshore, which is the place to beat the heat this summer.So if you haven't been, you have to go to the new swim, dock and aquatic playground. It's an.Absolute hit.The airport will continue to invest in improvements for accessing the terminal building and also rehabilitation on some of its airfield runways. And lastly, again, utilities. There's many men and women who work in this city that do work every day, ensuring that our utilities are safe and function for all of our residents.And I want to again champion the work that the water departments do, planning to do to invest in their infrastructure. And we're also planning to do work for our storm pump station. This continues addressing some of the emergency upgrades that we need to do to ensure that we're safe when we have storm events.So that's the overarching copybook. But I wanted to delve a little bit deeper into measure. There's some great things happening with the measure of funds that the voters of this city approved. Hopefully, everyone is familiar with the Measure Reinvestment Plan and hopefully we've had an opportunity to actually visit the measure.The city's measure, a web page at Long Beach dot gov board slash measure a in there you will see this map and some details about what that investment plan means. So this is a snapshot of three years of measure.And it's amazing when you start thinking we are receiving $80 million towards infrastructure in just three years. I cannot emphasize the positive impact this has had to our cities.See IP.So kind of part of that five year investment strategy and infrastructure. This map is showing just the facility and park projects. So we've taken off the street layer and we wanted to highlight over 50 and park facility projects are identified as part of Measure a plan.And if you look closely, it's probably hard to tell on the screen. But if you look closely, there's 17 projects that are highlighted in green, which will be delivered by the end of this year. Again, we're making really good progress on our commitment to this community, and I look forward to continuing that.19. So measure eight projects, new park projects. I mentioned El Dorado, Duck Pond and Davenport. I also want to highlight some upgrades to our sports courts at El Dorado, Low, Cerritos and Silverado. These are important recreation opportunities for many of our residents in the city.Measure also supports many facilities. Improvements to Alamitos and El Dorado libraries are planned for fiscal year 19 public safety buildings, as I mentioned. Also our animal care center and our health facilities. So back again to mobility projects are citywide.Investment in streets, sidewalks and alleys and bridges is very important. This council has made that commitment and you're seeing that continued with the investment that were planned for 19. And I mentioned the pump stations earlier. I want to transition a little bit and talk about the future.So while Measure is planned right now in the first three years to provide $80 million of its commitment towards infrastructure, staff has identified some additional resources. So during the city manager and mayor's budget presentation, there was a discussion about $55.3 million a future measure.A staff is proposing that $35 million of that be allocated to infrastructure. This would include 25 and a half million dollars to support the fire and police training facilities, $6.3 million for facility improvements based on priorities in the facility condition assessment.Also, an additional $2.3 million towards new park playgrounds to include a new signature themed playground and recreation park and also upgrades to playgrounds at Eldorado, Sycamore Grove, Cherry Park and Ramona Park. Staff is also recommending that of that $55 million, 20.3 million be allocated towards public safety budgets.This would help support additional PD and fire academy classes. Body worn cameras, which were talked about in the previous presentation and other investments. Investment in the city's infrastructure is driven by successful strategic planning, which starts with understanding the needs.This council supports smart investment strategies, including those identified in our pavement and alley management plans, which we will continue to update every two years. A new sidewalk assessment which is currently underway, and that's going to create a full GIS structure that will allow us to track all necessary improvements across the city.We're also working on a facility facility condition assessment, which will help us all prioritize where the most critical needs exist and are over 130 facilities across the city. Stormwater Masterplan is also important. While we've looked at our pump stations in 2015 and we have emergency work identified that we're moving forward to address.We do need to work to identify funding to understand exactly what our stormwater system needs. There's a number of deferred maintenance in our pipelines and we look forward to identifying future strategic funding for that purpose. The proposed Fiscal Year 19 Capital Improvement Plan provides a balanced approach in addressing much needed maintenance and new amenities, keeping Long Beacha great place to live, work and play. Thank you for your time and I'm available to address Council's questions. Thank you, Mr. Beck. I'm going to start with Councilwoman Pryce.Thank you. Excellent presentation. Mr. Beck, we all enjoy your announcer voice. The it's just rolls off so naturally. But I just really wanted to thank you and your team. It's been a tremendous amount of effort on your part to, you know, efficiently utilize the incoming revenue in a way that is balanced and across the entire city.And I personally appreciate that and I thank you and your team for that. I wanted to ask about libraries. I know a lot of our libraries have critical needs. We're trying to encourage people to go to libraries. We're trying to make sure that they remain relevant part of the community.And so I think taking a hard look at where we can improve our library facilities to modernize them a little bit would be really great, especially since we're going to have a beautiful modern library here at Main. And we want to make sure that that spirit and the welcoming nature of that is shared throughout.So, you know, I know we have a lot of older buildings, if there's any, as we're thinking about roof improvements and things, if there's any design elements that we can utilize to make the spaces brighter, more open, things that can be done that are not as costly but perhaps would create a more inviting space.I think that would be really good. And I just wanted to kind of throw that out there as a suggestion if there's some efficiencies to be had because we're out there doing work anyway. I know we've been working with you on Bayshore and some opportunities there, but I'm sure many other libraries are in the same boat becausethey were built around the same time. So so that's really all I wanted to add. And I just wanted to thank both public works and PRM and all the city departments that have been involved in the implementation of a lot of these CIP projects.It's just been a fantastic year, I think. And again, I like to see that we spread the the benefits citywide so that every resident gets to see the benefits of the investment that they've made in the city. So thank you.This Councilmember Price, I would like to highlight a little bit on the and the libraries. While I didn't have it in my presentation, there is work ongoing in many of our libraries besides some of the maintenance issues we're looking at improving circulation desks and also adding hearing loops at many of our libraries.And I know that's an important topic for you. Thank you very much. Next up is Councilman Mungo.Thank you, Mr. Beck. I really appreciate your presentation. As you know, this is my most exciting part of the budget. I want to echo your comments related to path of travel. As our city ages, it is of the utmost importance that our community is out and walking and to be able to walk our community path of travelis of the utmost importance. I appreciate the efforts to double what we put forward last year. I only know that it would only be better if we could get to four times where we are. Because I know that to get to the standard amounts we were at before the curb cuts would be 4 million.I also appreciate that within your requirements are many, many long term and big improvements. And while I am very excited about the number of additions and upgrades to our Park Playground equipment, I look forward to working with the Budget Oversight Committee over the next after the budget process, but more towards the winter months.On working through the three year plan and the breakout of those specific categories and where they could be. Because as we want to make sure there's a new park playground in every space of the city that's accessible to everyone and adjacent to any of the areas that have a lot of activity related to older siblings where theyounger siblings can play. And so I appreciate the work that you've done on that as well. I appreciate working with your office on Creative Solutions. And so I know that not all of the things in the capital improvement projects like Storm and Sewer are sexy.I think that they're really important because as the rains do come, the work that you've done in stormwater facilities and the such have really made a considerable impact on the flooding in our neighborhoods, especially with the uneven pavement of the streets that haven't been graded in a long time.And so I know you're working through your street plan. You specifically mentioned the 11th Street projects and the gasoline tax. And so if that would be repealed, those would not be completed. Do you know the 11th Street projects off the top of your head?Councilman Romano I do not, but there was an item that this council approved they had to pass originally, right? Yeah. So they're all listed on that. And yes, you are correct, those 11th Street projects would go away if the SB one tax is repealed.I just think it's important whether you're for or against it. I just think it's important that you know what you're voting on specifically. And so I know that I'll do my best to pull that too from four from before and actually with the council presentation, wasn't it the council presentation from before?And just so that people are aware because I get a lot of questions about that tax and I'm not always able to off the top of my head tell them which streets they know of that would be repaired and so those would not be repaired should that be repealed.And I think that's important for people to know. Thank you for all the work you've done. Great, great presentation. Best presentation in four years. So I'm excited about the new improvements.Think a councilwoman. And before I move on to Councilman Austin, I can just quickly respond. I think from what I remember correctly, well, there are a variety of highway improvements that are immediate SB one funded streets, the immediate SB one and largest project that gets funded is the entire reconstruction of PCH.That's from the entrance of of Long Beach on the on the east side, all the way to its exit in western in the west side of the city. So I know that's the that's the first project that the state has funded using SB one as far as major street project.And of course it will be many, many others. But that because that is a a state highway, I know that that is on the list on top of, of course, all the residential streets and everything else that will get funded through some of the local return dollars.Councilman Austin.Thank you. And this is a very encouraging presentation, CERP budget. I wouldn't say one of the the best that I've seen in my six years on the council and seven budgets. So kudos to our public works department and every department that has had anything to do with this.There are a couple of major art arteries in the north that are better called out here. Obviously, Market Street has been a high priority for my office to fix that. I mean, and many residents are sitting here and getting emails from residents watching the construction going on around the district and they're asking about Market Street.And so they've seen great improvements on Orange Avenue and and all around the district. But Market Street still is a street that is a priority. And I'm glad to see it's it's being funded and and we're close to getting some work done there as well as.Olmos Boulevard, I believe the Alamo is to one funded as well. Is that correct? Mr. Beck?That sounds correct. I don't have the list in front of me. I can get back to you.Well, I don't know if anybody mentioned it or asked the question, but what are the impacts of SB one? We do know that that is a funding source that was provided by the legislature after many years of work to to get that done.And, you know, there's there's some some efforts to try to repeal that on the ballot. Where would that be? And the repeal specifically, what would that mean in dollars in terms and in projects to the city of Long Beach right now?So we did receive a little the city did receive a little bit of money in this fiscal year, about two and a half million dollars from SB one, though those dollars have already been implemented into projects. In fact, we're currently working on a project in District three on the ATO that is SB one funded.There's a couple more in the city that we're working on. The one that I've highlighted in the CHP presentation, those 11 streets that this council adopted by resolution will be built with roughly $8 million that we anticipate receiving in fiscal year 19 from SB one.So if SB one was repealed, we would not receive $8 million and those streets would not get built out at this point in time. We've also put into our five year plan an additional $8 million in 20 and an additional $8 million in 21.So you can see that that would add up pretty quickly, 24 or $25 million in three years. That goes directly to street projects.Yeah. Thank you for explaining that. And it would just you know, I'm sure we'll be talking more about that outside of council over time and what the what the public in the near future. I will say that that I've also heard from many residents and I just just will compliment your department for the management and even thecontractors doing the work. But there is a noticeable difference in terms of the quality of work being performed as well. I'm hearing that from residents who are, you know, seeing it firsthand and are really, really thankful and appreciative of the the curbs, the the the gutters, the sidewalks, the streets.I think we are experiencing unprecedented amount of infrastructure and infrastructure and and construction in our city right now. And I can say specifically, even in my district right now, we're seeing quite a bit it's a little bit of an inconvenience.But these are these are good inconveniences. They have because it's, I believe, an investment in our in our future. And we talk about being a livable city, increasing livability and quality of life. We don't do that without investing in our infrastructure.So those are my comments. I'm going to be very brief. I like what I see. I'm thrilled that that we have identified money for the hopefully to build out of Davenport Park and phase two complete can now complete really soon and the street improvements are just just just fantastic.So this is the best budget that I've seen in seven years. Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember Pearce.I too enjoyed your announcer voice and your AP budget and so great work. I do have a couple questions. Let's see where to start. I do want to say I know everybody's giving you praise. I want to give you too much praise and we get too excited.But it is a really exciting time to be a councilmember. I know that you guys did the hard work to get Measure E passed. The voters did a hard job of passing that, and it's really great to be in council whenever we're able to to see all these changes.And you've done a great job on Broadway. I know that it's kind of a terrifying we'll be doing this whole story. You've done a great job about doing it piece by piece, working with the residents. And so I just want to say to you and your staff how much we really appreciate how smooth that has gone.So let's see. I have where to start. The beach, playgrounds. Can you talk? It says that it's unfunded. Can you talk about a funding plan for those beach playgrounds and a timeline for those? You know, I'm just like.So are you referring to the unfunded section? Yes.The city book? Yes, sir.So we thought it was important to add not only projects that were funded, but some projects that were still seeking funding for.Hmm.There are a number of priorities competing against the Tidelands dollars. We have seen some slight increase in Tidelands with the increase in price of oil. Hopefully that will continue in a way that will allow us to fund some of our priority projects.Playgrounds, pools, many of the other activities in the Tidelands, there's a number of different competing projects, but if there is extra money available, we wanted to make sure that that was highlighted. So this council would understand that there are projects on the shelf ready to go.If funding is available.Great. And I do I love seeing all the new park programs that are in here. I do want to lift up the Bixby Park. You know, and I know my predecessor did a lot of work envisioning Bixby Park.Spend a lot of time and money. And I want to thank Councilmember Price for sharing the cost of putting in the dog park there. We divided our divide by nine funds. We did not have majority funds to do that.We still have. I asked our most recent owner director to try to come back with the budget for what parcel one would look like. And I know that, you know, the funds of Bixby Park are going to work hard to fundraise.We're going to work hard to fundraise. In my mind, though, that parcel probably won't cost that much. And so it would be great if we could try to identify some funds and measure A to try to finish that parcel and the visioning with the dig and everything so that we're not spending another two years trying to putpennies together to make something happen that your department could probably make happen much quicker and save us all a lot of time and energy from all the conversations. I will have to have to get that funding together. So I want to put that as a priority that if we could get parcel one done along, you know, sometimeafter Broadway is finished, I think would be awesome.Yeah, there's some great work happening in Bixby Park right now, not only the dog park, but the investment in the community center in the shade structure. It's really great to be able to see those assets get improved in that community.Absolutely. I mean, I think, you know, parcel three, parcel two and really parcel one is that other parcel where we've got the structures in the middle. I mean, it is we went over there to have a community meeting and they are falling apart.And it it's going to take some capital to make sure that we can deter that that we've got lighting over there. And because of the situation, I know we have to have P.D. out there a lot. And so we did meet with them with our both of our commanders and Bixby Park.And they're going to go out there and do an assessment to try to help us get to there. And we're going to work with our new parks director. So I just hope that that as we're identifying funds, if it is, you know, smaller pennies, then building a whole new park, it would be really helpful, I think, forthat community to kind of have that finished. And then I had a question around the senior center. I know that we're looking at trying to relocate that senior center. I know there's some conversations happening. The funds that were earmarked for Measure eight for that, are they still earmarked for when it moves?Yeah. So there's a couple of things going on with the senior center. There were some major funded to do improvements. We paused those improvements because we were concerned about potential subsidence issues and structural challenges in the building that the senior centers in.And we're talking about the senior center on Fourth Street. Yes, we did do a review and a geo technical survey and determined that we can address what subsidence was occurring and that it was a non structural challenge in the building.So at this point in time there is that money available to move forward. I know there is a secondary conversation happening about a potential move at the senior center. I think at this point in time it looks like the senior center is going to stay at its current location for a period of time and that we're planningto move forward with those improvements. So kind of green light, we're moving forward and we'll be making some improvements. Senior center soon.Great. And just while it's on the top of my head, I know that the seaside print shop was recently sold and is going to be a senior daycare, but it's a high end senior daycare, so I'll connect you guys with the people that recently purchased it, and maybe we can talk about shared resources on that corridor.It's not ideally what I would love there, but I think it's going to be a good asset. They're going to keep it nice and clean and tidy. Two other questions. You've talked about doing roof repairs. What is the conversation been within your department around the core roofs program that L.A. has implemented?So I think citywide we really have been embracing sustainable efforts and not only cool roofs, but solar. We're getting ready to do a new battery program at our public safety buildings so we can look at how we're we're purchasing and offloading not only solar, but but peak power.We we support sustainable efforts. We have installed the cool roofs. And I think you're referring to kind of the white colored roofs instead of a black or a charcoal, which has been typical many roofs. So we have done that and we support doing more.Great. And then at the convention center, is it a million that we have earmarked for the convention center or more?And in the FY19 budget, we're proposing $1,000,000 for convention center improvements.And can you quickly, if you have it, if you can remember the improvements that we did last year and what these went to and what these improvements would go to. I know that.I apologize. I don't have that list. I know there was some lighting work and some other. I can get.That for you and follow up.Okay. I just want to I know that every year we talk about the convention center and the needs to focus on the bones and everything else. And last year we were able to put in a beautiful fountain. And I also know that we have a lot of other projects in the Tidelands like Alameda Speech, Rainbow Lagoon anda lot of these playgrounds. And so just want to be able to have all that information in front of us and exactly what is proposed to be funded so we can make a decision on the Council and Tidelands if that's in fact where we want to spend our money this year.And then the last thing is, I see that Vision Zero action plan so that it's unfunded. I thought that we were moving forward with with that.And that may be misleading certainly to the development of the Vision Zero Action Plan is funded. We are moving forward. We have a consultant on board. We have started that work. What is unfunded right now is improvements that would come out of that action plan.We don't know what those are exactly. I don't have that report. I do anticipate bringing a Vision Zero action plan to this council, hopefully in the next six, nine months, on the outside, six months. And then we could start having that conversation about where those priorities lie.Okay, great. And I'll just echo my support for four Vision zero. I think you guys have done a great job about your improvements and as we continue with Measure A, makes sense. So get that in front of us sooner rather than later.So great, great, great work. Really pleasure working with you guys. Love your energy efficiency, sustainability vision as you go through this work. So thank you.Thank you. Vice Mayor Andres.Yes, thank you, Mayor. Real quickly, Greg, I just want to thank you guys for a great job you're doing. And I just hope my council, my community is really watching this because the fact that when we have our community, you know, like budget, you know, meeting, I really hope that they can come and hear the good newsthat you have done for our district. Thank you again, big guy. Great job.That would be Thursday at 6:00, I think. Mr. Sanders, thank you. Councilmember Cipriano.Thank you. Great presentation. And I won't get into the weeds here, but since it was brought up, you had the traffic circle listed on the presentation. We've talked about that in the past, but it just struck me if the PCH project doesn't go through, that would impact that traffic circle differently.It'd be a lot easier to do the Traffic Circle Project if the PCH project goes through also at the same time. So we'll keep an eye on that. And I want to echo what everyone said about the the a great budget here.But I also want to say to Craig Beck.Every day I marvel at your management skill in operating a very complex department. Thank you.Thank you. And I think you, Mr. Beck, you and your team are doing a great job managing all the new projects that we have, just all of a sudden. So thank you. Is there a public comment on the CHP budget?Please come forward.Oh, my God. Oh, my gosh.Karen Reside, resident of the First District.It's great.To see all of the advancements.The city has made in the project. There's just a couple of things to put on my Gray Panther hat right now for the seniors, a city of our size, according to recommendations, should have a senior center for every 50,000 residents.So we only have six, which wouldn't really be full fledged senior centers. And we're the only city of our size that doesn't have a modern, up to date senior center.So it's great that we're starting.To to look at that process and to see what the needs are of our seniors are. But we want to also preserve the senior center that's on Fore Street. That senior center is.Heavily, heavily used.By residents in that district. And if that senior center as close to the services go away, it's going to very negatively impact the seniors that live in that particular area. They just want to bring that. And also I want to mention sidewalks.You know, we're replacing sidewalks and there are some still that are really. When the assessment was done, like the ones around St Mary's, where a lot of seniors go, that there's one that's got a razor that's like eight inches high.And I walk it twice a week when I go and volunteer there and one is afraid I'm going to trip over it.So if that could be pushed out.That's really health and safety hazard. And the tiles on Pine Avenue, the snatch where it's all elevated. I know Donna Darnella has tripped and fallen on those tiles. So have I. And so is Jack. Matt Smith, who before he passed, said a lawsuit on that.So those are just some key issues that needs for our seniors and also lighting. And I know we're on a road lighting replacement program. I hate going down Pacific Avenue. It's the street I heavily travel. It's not that well, but thank you for all the hard work and it's great to see the improvement province.Keep up the good work.Thank you. There's a motion in a second to receive and file and and will continue to the next budget hearing, which is next council meeting. Please cast your votes.Motion carries.Thank you.And the next item is the the last item that we will try to time certain but it's the budget so it's been difficult is item 19.\nSummary:", "answer": "Recommendation to conduct a Budget Hearing to receive and discuss an overview of the Proposed Fiscal Year 2019 Budget for the following Departments: Fire, Police and Disaster Preparedness; and, Capital Improvement Program."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nAll right. Oh. Okay, now you guys are going to move on. I'm going to move up in I because in fact, I do have to leave in a few minutes because I'll move up to item 40 and can we please read that I didn't put.Yes. Now I'm going to go back because I have to leave. Can I move that up?Unless. Objection of the council. Yes, the chair can move the calendar.Okay. The projection. Okay. Please come up. Item number 40, she believes item.Item follows communication from city attorney. Recommendation to declare ordinance amending the Long Beach Municipal Code relating to hotel worker safety precautions. Read the first time and later What to do next. Regular meeting of the City Council for Final Reading Citywide.Yes.We have a member first instance. Could I have a second, please? Fine. Okay. Yesterday. Any comments on this item? Public comment.I wanted to make a few changes to the proposed ordinance, if that's possible.Public can you want? Well, we'll let you go, that's for sure.That way they can comment on the proposed budget.For that purpose. Thank you.Very much. So there's just a few clarifying changes I would like to make, and I'm asking that through the process of inter delineation that we make the following changes on page one, subsection f. Hotel employer means a person who owns controls and or operates a hotel in the city of Long Beach and ask that everything after theword beach be deleted as not necessary. Under on page two. Item 5.54.030. Subsection A. I would ask that we add on the first section there, a hotel employer shall provide a panic button to each hotel employee assigned to work in a guest room without other employees present.Regardless of job classification and at no cost to the hotel employee, it is recognized that b I would like to add it is recognized that because of the varying size and physical layout of each hotel, different devices may be appropriate for different hotels.And then to resume the rest of the paragraph under sub b. I'd like to add, after the hotel, employer must allow guests room doors to be left open during cleaning. I'd like to add nothing herein shall prevent a hotel employee from voluntarily electing to keep a guest.Room door closed.During cleaning as the hotel employee sees fit. Under item B sub two a I'd like to add. After the word behavior for the duration of any continued occupancy by the person at the hotel. Under Section 5.54.040. On page two of three, I'd like to remove the word immediately.The chapter shall be brought into full compliance with provisions of this chapter. And I'd like to add, not later than six months following the effective date of this chapter, to allow compliance by hotels of all sizes. Those were my only changes.Thank you.So with that, thank you. Vice Mayor. Yes.Councilwoman Margo. No comment. Okay, Count Councilwoman Gonzalez.Can we is there public comment that we.Can get when we go into that? Okay, fine. Could we have public comment on this item? You want to come and speak on it?Be.Good evening. My name is Gary Hetrick. I reside in the fourth district and I do have a few comments. I've actually got a letter on behalf of the Long Beach Coalition for Good Jobs and Healthy Community that I'd like to read into the record.I'm also on the steering committee of the Long Beach Coalition for Good Jobs and Healthy Community. Community, excuse me, Honorable Vice Mayor, members of the City Council, Long Beach, City Attorney Charles Park. And on.September 4th, our council members Pierce.Mungo Andrew Super. Now, Austin brought forward an item that directed the city attorney to draft a similar ordinance to measure WW, slated to be on the Long Beach November 2018 ballot. That includes a request for hotels to have safety panic buttons, but similarly ignores working conditions of workers by not limiting the square footage assigned to hotel workers. We believe this creates a conflict of interest under the Political Reform Act. We have submitted a formal request to the Enforcement Division of the Fair Political Practice Commission for further investigation and clarification regarding the Long Beach City Council.Item 8-0797 and its conflict of interests with the Long Beach Council item Agenda Item Resolution 8-0118. We believe that this undermines the efforts and hard work of major WW proponents 46,000 plus voters and residents of the city of Long Beach.We are clear that these efforts are put forth to confuse voters to the advantage of hoteliers and opposition to the measure. Additionally, it should be noted that these same five council members who were the same ones who opposed similar previous motions brought forward in the past year advocating for these safety measures.It was made clear to us that we could not count on our city council to protect Long Beach hotel workers due to this measure. WW As set forth on August 17, 2018, the City Council adopted Resolution 18 Dash 0118 for the placement of Measure WW on the November 2018 ballot measure.WW, if approved by the voters, would require a hotel in the city of Long Beach. Of 50 or more rooms to supply hotel employees who work in guest rooms without hotel employees. Present with an electronic contact contact device for summoning unseen assistants and reporting threatening conduct absent from tonight's proposed ordinance.However, our measure WW provisions that hotels and business lobbying groups disagree with most venomously. The proposed ordinance does not include a proposed excuse me a provision requiring hotels to post a notice in guest rooms, advising guests that hotel employees have panic buttons and are protected under the law.The proposed ordinance does not include protections against inhumane workloads or mandatory overtime. The proposed ordinance does not include robust enforcement and anti retaliation provisions that major WW does. Again, we believe this creates a conflict of interest under the Political Reform Act with grave concern.The Long Beach Coalition for Good Jobs and a Healthy Community. Thank you.Thank you very much. The aim of public comment on this item. And we move back to the diocese. Councilwoman Gonzalez.Yes. Thank you. So I still have the same concerns as I did last time relative to timing the process. I spoke with Charlie today about legal implications that we had talked about. And you'd met and I was on the in the understanding that when we had brought this when this was brought forward last time, that we wouldreceive a two from four some sort of memo that would talk whether it was no legal implications or legal implications, that it would at least address that question prior to this coming back. So can you address that city attorney?After our conversation, I'm been able to watch the entire tape because it went on for quite a bit of time. But at some point, 7 hours and 42 minutes into the meeting, you had raised those questions. But the only report that was requested back at that time was the Economic Analysis Report.I believe we had asked about the Political Reform Act, and I had indicated I had just received the proposed ordinance on the Friday before and had not done any research on it. But I, I didn't know that there was a request for a two from four and I didn't see that in the in looking at that.And I asked Linda in my office to also look at the tape. If we missed that, I apologize. But we did not provide it to from four. We did do the legal research. We do not believe that this proposal before you this evening is any way illegal or that the council is prohibited from moving forward.If it wishes to do that tonight, it does not violate the Political Reform Act. We did receive one letter from the law firm Democrat and Stamper and Hillsborough. We had two different conference calls with them, with their research analysts, their general counsel, and their outside counsel on September 7th and on September 19th, where we discussed in detailtheir letter and why we did not believe that it supported the conclusion that the Council could not move forward with that. So we did our own research on this and we believe that it is if both measures, if this is adopted and WW is adopted by the voters, they can coexist.It does not conflict if one passes and the other doesn't. Obviously then the other one could go forward. So with that said, we believe that if council wishes to move forward with this ordinance this evening, they can do so.Okay. Thank you. So I would like to I'm still I have a lot of questions. And I think another major topic that was brought forward was outreach to the motels that I don't believe has been done. I've connected with a few motels in my district and they've not even heard of this ordinance whatsoever.And so with that said, I'd like to make a motion for a substitute motion for a received file of this and for us to get additional information back, whether that's the legal implications in a two from four and then maybe even I'd like to hear from my colleagues as to what they'd like to do in terms ofthe business outreach and then even a fiscal impact study on this, as we talked about.Thank you, Councilwoman Pearce.Mm hmm.Yes, I think I still have the same concerns. As we previously had. I think that I did outreach to my businesses as well and received an email today that said that there had been no outreach done. So I'm curious from city manager, you know, as we stated the first time this came up, we did four years ofoutreach with big hotels that are very different from hotels of 50 rooms or less. And I feel very uncomfortable with continuing to move forward with an ordinance not, you know, a study, but an ordinance today that would dictate something for those hotels.50 rooms are lost. So can somebody clarify where we're at with that community process?I'm.I'm not sure that we were directed to do a committee process that the staff level for hotels under 50.We had about a 30 minute conversation about it last time.I don't recall.I mean, I support the substitute motion on the floor. I think my position stands the same as previously. You know, approving of this ordinance today. I'm not comfortable with the fact that there's an OPC, you know, request for investigation on this.I'm not comfortable with the fact that our vote has already been used to politicize something that's on WW, which is what we said would happen. There's already a mail piece that's out there that's paid for by the chamber that's trying to interfere with something.It is not appropriate for us to be voting on this before the election. I'm all for waiting and getting some more information and engaging with constituents and businesses. I think that that is the responsible thing as elected officials to do.So I support this substitute motion.Thank you very much, Councilman Richardson, please.Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor. So so we had a long back and forth about the process and not what we landed on was that this will come back after we conduct the public outreach. And I believe it was Councilwoman Mango's motion.And I, I, I offered a friendly to say no outreach during the election period, simply so that, you know, simply so that we maintain the integrity of the election that was happening. And then Councilwoman Mongo accepted that friendly and then I went back and watched the earlier today and that's exactly what happened.So, Mr. City attorney what what how did how is this in front of us today?Council member and members of the Council. I do not recall the direction to do public outreach prior to bring this back. There was a discussion with the mayor myself on that. This may come back. They were asked within 30 days and my recollection was there was discussion and I think John Keisler was talking about the study, theeconomic impact of that study and how whether they would be studying hotels with only 50 rooms or more. And I believe he said in the tape that the study may have some hotels in it with less than 50 rooms.So some of that impact analysis may be applicable. May not? I, I don't recall, but I do not recall any direction from the council that prior to bringing this ordinance back, that some sort of outreach and report be presented to the city council.That to me, that wasn't clear in the motion and on the vote. Five oh to bring this back to city council.So there was a bit of comment or back and forth about how long it would take you to bring this back. I believe he said something like, you know, 6 to 8 weeks it would take to bring this back.Then we had a conversation about we had a conversation about outreach and a number of councilmembers expressed their concern about, hey, this is very different than WWE because it impacts a lot of smaller businesses. And in general, I don't think people would have a problem with, hey, if this is the direction the voters want to go orthe council wants to go. Sure, implement it citywide. But we should have a conversation with small businesses. And a lot of questions were raised about just, frankly, the political nature of this, given that there's an election, you know, two weeks from now with Major WW And already I received over the weekend a mail piece stating that thecity council already has an ordinance on panic buttons. So this is the timing of this is exactly what we talked about. Political. It's political. And if we really want to do it, this is a sin. Since a sincere effort, then what we should do is do what the motion what my understanding of the motion was, and wecan talk about that offline again. But my understanding was we are going to do outreach to the small businesses and we were going to begin the outreach after the election has come and gone and so and so and so that would be my sub so that we go back to what the original Y understanding was and ifthat wasn't what was what the motion was, if I misunderstood, if I have a misunderstanding, then that's what I would offer to the full council today that no, I don't think that we should receive a file. I think there's a lot of merit to the proposal, but it should happen after we've conducted outreach and that outreach shouldbe in after the election period. And when I and to be more specific outreach to and there are there are groups that represent these smaller motels I know because they engaged with us when we initially talked about cracking down on nuisance motels.And so there are groups of stakeholders that probably we know who they are because we're engaging on the conversation with the motels right now. So we should engage with those groups in small and maybe talk with the different council members about the smaller motels in their district about implementation plans.I think in general, in general, it may not take a very long time if we're already engaged in these people to say here's our rollout plan. But I think it should be I think we should do everything we can to be sincere about moving this forward without any appearance of this being politically motivated whatsoever.And I am not making any implications to any city attorney, anybody on the council. I just think in an election season, that's when people are going to people going too soon. So my substitute substitute motion here is that we pick this up with outreach after the election period, a period of outreach to the small businesses.And then we bring that back and allow that to inform the crafting of this ordinance and bring that back to city council after that process has been concluded. And so that's my substitution.Danny in 1/2. Okay, fine. Yes, Councilman, you may know.Vice mayor, many of the concerns that were raised during the first discussion of this really raised eyebrows, especially in the sense of that this was item was being fast tracked. It was presented as a supplemental item or a holiday.And then we discuss it on a Tuesday following the supplemental introduction of this item. There was a lot of discussion, as the city attorney pointed out, there was a seven hour discussion that went into well into the morning and a lot of things were probably missed.And I don't blame either the city manager or the city attorney for probably missing some of those points that were made by Councilmembers Gonzales and Pierce in regards to doing outreach and getting a24 from Memo to the Council regarding some other background and some other discussions that we had that evening.It was a long night. And certainly reviewing the the video, you know, 7 hours, 7 hours the same. It's a full day of employment. So it's it very easily I could see where we could miss that. Or a lot of the questions that I had then are still not answered.And this is incomplete staff work as I as as I see it. And it's not complete. It's still had to work to be done. I support the motion currently on the floor because we do need to wait and we do.This has been totally, completely politicized. Like we didn't want it to be in the first place. And yet here we are and there's probably some more hit pieces out there talking about the city. You know Mr. Good. Mean the the problem is is that when you put a part of an item on supplemental.It's it's supposed to be something that's going to be well looked at. It's going to be studied. It's going to be properly reviewed and presented. And this item was not. And so I my position stands and I will be supporting the substitute item.Thank you, Congressman Young Councilman Austin.Thank you very much, Mr. Vice Mayor. I'll keep my comments brief. As I know we have been going back and forth and debating this particular issue for now, well over a year. And this council and many members of this council have come under serious criticism from various organizations for not moving quick enough on this.I don't necessarily see this as a politicized issue. I'm going to be very quick when I do see it. It has been politicized. But in terms of this ordinance, this ordinance, I think reflects the will of this entire council, and that is to provide greater protections to the women in the hotel industry.And whether or not what happens on a ballot in a couple of weeks, this issue will provide an assurance that greater protections will will happen for for women who work in hotels, for any employees who work in our hotels in the city of Long Beach.And so I don't think I want to support the substitute motions. And for that reason, I won't. But I do have a question for the the the maker here Councilmember Price you in one of your your amendments to your original motion you struck the word from 5.54040.Any hotel containing 50 or more guests were suites rooms operating under existing business license. On the effective date of this chapter shall immediately be brought into full compliance with the chapter. You changed that to six months. Can you explain why?Sure. I did that to be consistent with our desire to have outreach, similar to what we did with the Styrofoam ban to give smaller businesses or hotels the opportunity to win, get educated, and then figure out because the cost is going to have to be borne by the motel.So they'll have to figure out what the costs are going to be an address to the ordinance. So that was the point of it to roll out implementation for the motels.So it was actually to do the outreach that's being recommended.Yes, because we don't currently have an ordinance to outreach to them on. But once we do, we'll have they'll have six months to get into compliance with the requirement that they have panic buttons and they'll have to evaluate what the fiscal impact is going to be for their own business, depending on the number of employees they have, that it's a broader category than just housekeepers pursuant to the amendment.Okay. Well, thank you for that clarification. I was concerned about the shift from immediately to six months, but understanding the reasoning and then hearing comments from our colleagues, I think that makes good sense.Congresswoman Press?Yes. Could the city attorney read the changes again? I was trying to find the ordinance. You were making changes? There were a number of them.Yes, I can. The the first changes in 5.54.020 definitions and subsection F and the new language reads as follows Hotel employer. That means a person who owns controls and or operates a hotel in the city of Long Beach, period.The remainder of that definition is stricken. The next change is found at 5.54030. Subsection A After the first sentence, a new sentence is added that reads It is recognized that because of varying size and physical layout of each hotel comma, different devices may be appropriate for different hotels, period.The next change is added at 5.54030. Paragraph B, subsection one. A new sentence is added. Nothing here in shall prevent a hotel employee from voluntarily electing to keep a guest room door closed during cleaning as the hotel employee sees fit.The next change is in that same section at paragraph two. Small a at the end of that sentence, they add the language for the duration of any continued occupancy by the person at the hotel. Subsection 5.54040 Application to existing hotels.That first sentence strikes the word immediately and adds so that it reads I'm sorry. So that it reads any hotel containing 50 or more guest rooms or rooms operating under the existing business license on the effective date of this chapter shall be brought into compliance for compliance with the provisions of this chapter not later than six monthsfollowing the effective date of this chapter. And that would conclude those reports. I would add that on that last change, if WW were to pass, as a number of people have said here, WW would take precedent over this ordinance.So anything that is in WW or is more restrictive as to the 50 or more hotels, that would be the applicable law as to the 50 or more hotels.Okay. Those I think those are my questions right now.All right. Thank you, counsel. Come to us and you through our council. Okay, Councilman.Okay, Mr. Attorney, going back to. So if we have a conflict that I believe one thing was voted on, but what was presented is something very different. What is what is the process to resolve that conflict?The you could do a motion at the evening of the meeting where the vote was five. Oh, you could have done a motion to reconsider that matter. No, I mean, that time has passed.If the process let me be more clear, if the process that I believe was voted on, if there's a conflict on how we interpret what happened, is there a path or a process to reconcile that?You could do a motion to rescind the previous action by the city council to reflect any changes the item and and or when you approve the minutes from that previous council meeting you could say that there's an error in the minutes or there was an error in the in the in the minutes as prepared.And you could do a motion to rescind the previous action by the city council and clarify it. Or you could clarify if you believe it was an error in the minutes of what was actually voted on. You could have that could be clarified at that time.And that we are here today.There's nothing you could you could put an item on the agenda to do to rescind the action taken on September 4th, or, as you've done in a subject, one of the substitute motions to receive and file this current item.And at that point, you're free to start again. You really haven't taken any action on the ordinance itself.Hmm. So really, there's no path beyond relitigating the conversation through re agenda, izing a motion to rescind that action. If we believe that what you have interpreted and what you've prepared is not consistent with the path that I thought the council voted on.So that's the only path to reconcile it?That's correct. It's a policy decision for the council that if what we brought before you and what you have before you this evening is not what you asked for, then you can vote to send us back, to change it, to receive and file it to do whatever it is you'd like to do that.Next question is there. So in crafting this ordinance, was this done internally or was this was this was a consultant hired on this? How was this crafted?This was done by one of the attorneys in my office. Okay.So it was crafted internally. Was any language in this ordinance lifted from the ordinances on the ballot?The answer to that is yes. We tried to, in the definitions and in the body of the language, to look at the proposed measure that is on the ballot, so that in the event that both of these passed, we could be consistent with our interpretation and and with the operation of it.Okay.Was has industry at all at any level of the industry? Have they been consulted on this?We have had conversations with, yes, hotel representatives. And as I mentioned earlier, individuals from Unite here and their law firm.So. So. And when did that outreach take place?As I indicated, we got a we received a letter from the law firm. The date of the letter is. September 12th. And on September we had a meeting with them on actually September 7th before their letter. And on September 19th after their letter.Okay. So September 12th and September 19th. And then this was crafted in those subsequent weeks, obviously to be be placed on the agenda. So this was had to be completed and then go through a review process and and then the noticing to go on the agenda.Right.That's correct. We because of the meeting was dark last week. It probably would have been ready for last week, but we weren't ready before that time.Okay. So this was drafted in about two weeks then. If we were we spoke with them about a month ago. This was drafted in two weeks.Yeah. The ordinance had been drafted and was being reviewed. Yes.Okay.So how long does it normally take to craft ordinances of its nature?That's impossible to answer. Tell me what the ordinance the marijuana ordinance took as years. Other ordinances take us a week.Yeah. I mean, this is like lightning speed. I mean, I've never seen an ordinance. And this.This ordinance is almost.Every council meeting.And this ordinance isn't that complicated. And it's four pages.Yeah, well, I don't know. I think, you know, we worked on a motel ordinance for human trafficking and conversions and all that, and it's been it's been well over a year, and I haven't seen an ordinance come back.It just it just seems to me that this came came it was developed fairly quickly. And I really wonder what the urgency was, because I didn't hear any motion, anything, any language in the motion that said expedite.Actually, there was conversation during the meeting between the mayor and there was an expectation that this would come back within 30 days. And I was saying I didn't know whether we could do it within 30 days. It's now 49 days after the request to prepare.So there was also conversation about waiting until we had outreach done after the election cycle. So how do we determine which comments we include and how we consider what we receive from the council and which comments we don't?The comments that were made, if they're not part of the motion, they remain comments and questions unless there is a direct request for that to be included or to be part of the motion. So while there was, as I think Councilmember Urunga mentioned, there was extended discussion on this item.I believe at the end of the day, the motion that passed five zero was to bring this back and there was no at least I wasn't aware and I wouldn't be doing the outreach study anyway, but I didn't hear that as part of the motion.And if I missed it, I apologize. But I certainly did not hear that.You have a copy of the motion. Is that available?Yes, it was a second substitute motion was made by Councilmember Mongeau, seconded by Councilmember Price to approve the recommendation as amended with a one year implementation period and remove recommendation for the motion carried by the following vote. Price.Supernormal Mungo Andrews and Austin. Yes. Absent Gonzales, Pierce, Suranga and Richardson.So there was so there was no no direction in that motion to expedite it and have it done in two weeks then.I just read the motion.Okay. Okay.Right. And then so in terms of in terms of the ordinance that's here and then what's going on the ballot in November in general, would you say that it's better or worse to have a little bit more time to see what the rules of the lay of the land or the law of the land is?If that if that happens in two weeks, we know with the law of the land. Is this the process you prefer to move forward? You know, in general is our city attorney is our elected city attorney. I would like for you to have a you know, a position on how you'd prefer our laws of our city tobe created. And it just seems that this has been rushed a bit. And I just wonder if you didn't have direction from the council to expedite. Is this what you prefer to do?There's a lot of things probably I don't prefer to do, but this isn't this isn't this isn't political on my part. I was asked to prepare a motion. I an ordinance. I prepare the ordinance and brought it back if if there's the will of the council to adopt it.The timing of that is I'm not going to play games on the clock. If it's ready, I bring it back. If I could point out that one of the motions made that evening, but then there was a second substitute motion.The substitute motion was to spend 60 days doing outreach, feasibility study for hotels under 50 rooms and request city attorney to use language currently in WWE and apply it to hotels under 50 rooms. That motion was made by Pearce, Councilmember Pearce and seconded by Councilmember Urunga.That motion failed. The substitute substitute motion was what was passed. So there was no request for outreach in the substitute substitute.Okay. And so my next question. Councilwoman Price, is there a copy of all those editions? There were. I tried with my highlighter when he read them off to try to keep up, but they came out pretty quick. Is there a copy, though, somewhere?No. The amendment? Yeah. Is there. Is it written anywhere? I'd like to. Okay. So I'm going to say I'm sorry I missed I missed probably the first few. So unless you want to like. Maybe we go through them again.I'd like to actually.Share that always some additional time. Why not?Okay. All right. Well.Then you can tell us some stories. Anything. Let's do it.All right.Okay. So what was the first one?I think the question would be directed to the city of Fallujah.And what was the first one? The first I missed like the first three when you read them on.The first change that I have in. Is that under section 5.54020 definitions, paragraph F Hotel employer. The new language will read Hotel Employer means a person who owns controls and or operator of a hotel in the city of Long Beach, period.The remainder of that definition to be stricken.Why was it why? Why was it included and why was it stricken? Was the impetus for that?I have no idea. He'll have to ask the maker of the motion.Miss Price.I'm sorry. Councilman Richardson. You cannot ask me questions as if I am your witness in a case that's not pursuant to Robert's Rules of Order. It is, if you'd like to vote, if.The chair would like to allow it. Okay, so I'm going to ask you to.Vote against it if you don't understand it.Well, I'd have an opportunity to discuss it if the counts will be reasonable enough for us to have some time to actually deal with this. But we have to deal with it tonight. We're going to go through that grueling process of dealing with it tonight.All right. So so what it said was hotel employer means anyone who owns controls and operates a hotel in the city of Long Beach. But it struck out or a person who owns controls or operates any contract leased or sublet premises in connect to or operated injunction with the hotel's purpose or person, other than that hotel employeewho provides services at that hotel. That seems like a lot of legal clarification. And what I don't want to do is strike it. If that somehow creates a loophole for people to somehow say that this doesn't apply to me as a hotel employer.So maybe, maybe, maybe one way to go about this is why was that extra language included? Mr. City Attorney.That language was included to include subcontractors, and it's similar, if not identical, to the language that is in W.W..Okay. So that that's language that came from WWE. Okay. Could it be in a situation where there's that would create a conflict between WWE on this if both of them passed?No.Okay. All right.What was the next one?The next added a sentence and per in subsection 5.540300. Paragraph A. After the first sentence, the sentence that is added reads as follows. It is recognized that because of varying size and physical layout of each hotel comma, different devices may be appropriate for different hotels, period.So what will be the impact legally from adding that line? What does that what does that mean? I mean, some. So that doesn't need to be the same panic button, same device at each hotel.That's correct. That there would be some ability for the hotels to have whatever is appropriate for the different size and layout. So may have something more akin to a radio that wouldn't be applicable in other hotels.Right. Makes sense. So. Okay. That's good. What's the next one?The next one is in the same section, paragraph bb1 adds the sentence. Nothing here in show prevent a hotel employee from voluntarily electing to keep a guest room door closed during cleaning as the hotel employee sees fit.Okay. And. And that seems like it makes sense to me. I just wonder if this was some of the if this was motivated by any of the input from the the outreach or I just wonder if it if this is like informed by a hotel employees experience or is it the hotel employers preference?I'm just curious. That's not something you can answer.That's correct. But my interpretation of that is it does provide some flexibility for the hotel employee. If this is a room where there's it's directly accessible to the outside and they felt safer keeping a close, this would allow them to do it.Okay. So and and what was the next. I believe I have the next one. Can you remind me what the next one was?Yes. The next one is in the same section, paragraph two. So A and that's since they're adding language at the end of that sentence to say for after or threatening behavior for the duration of any continued occupancy by the person at the hotel.Further clarifying how long they could be reassigned.Understood. Understood. Okay. And so and now a question for you about implementation. So this goes to a first reading than a second reading and then the process of improvement. What is your understanding on that process of implementation? Because you said in the last motion there was a year.Process. What does that actually look like?Well, I think there's two questions in there. The first is, is that if this were to pass this evening, you would have the first reading. The next reading would occur at your next regularly scheduled council meeting, which I believe is in two weeks.And then 31 days after the mayor signs it, the ordinance would go into effect at that time based upon the change in language in 5.5 for the hotels, 50 or more would be brought into compliance. They would have six months to come into compliance with the effective date of the chapter, and those hotel rooms with 50 orless rooms would have up to 12 months to come into compliance with this ordinance.Okay. All right.I understand that, but I'd like to amend my my motion to say that, like a like a two from four in addition to this, that outlines what that implementation looks like. And I'd like to understand if there is an opportunity to because we're going to be doing work with with nuisance motels in the city.Is there an opportunity to find some efficiencies in how we conduct outreach to the small to the small, you know, small operators? Because if we're telling them, hey, we have a vision for what a modern motel looks like in our city, it should be consistent with our safety standards.I consider this a safety standard as well as all of our nuisance abatement, anti-human trafficking standards, all those things we're already engaging on so well. So what would be the proper way to do that? Should we just include it in the motion to include a two from four?Or is there some additional work that needs to be done to make sure that those efforts are aligned in some way?Yes, I think you could request the city manager, whoever this will be assigned to for implementation of this ordinance, would then be charged with notification and letting these folks know that this new law has been passed by the Council and business license could do outreach and and discussions with them.And I think they already do so. And there's the task force that talks about the hotel issues that you mentioned.Who who would take the would which department would take the lead on this outreach.So if this is a change in operation of a business, this would likely be a notification from business licensing as to a change in status.Okay.Understood. And the last thing I'll say is it seems like the motion in front of us, it seems like the motion in front of us says that we vote on this tonight. And then in two weeks we have the second reading and then a month for the mayor to to sign it.And then the outreach would be would begin.And I'm sorry, correction. The motion that's before me right now is a substitute substitute on the floor.I understand. And then the substitute substitute would say essentially that that process would just be pushed back for two weeks. So they're relatively the same, with the exception of what I just added about outlining that process. So so frankly, they seem very similar to me.So they seem very similar to me. The motions now they've been explained.Thank you.Thank you. Next, please, Councilwoman Rice.Okay, thank you. Councilmember Richardson and I do it while you read me the the changes. I do appreciate some of the questions that were asked. And it reminded me of some of the other questions that I wanted to follow through on.It looks like by reading the ordinance that it does include subcontractor workers. Is that correct?City attorney does not at this time as amended.Okay. And I know I'm not putting you on trial, Councilmember Price, but I do want to ask if there's a reason for not including subcontracted workers, because we know that that is a very large percentage of employees in the hotel industry.I think I've made my amendments clear. Thank you.Okay. So I will just note that many hotels in our city use subcontracted workers for entire departments, sometimes housekeeping. And so while we could pass this and we could pat ourselves on the back and say we passed something, if a hotel has an entire department that has subcontracted housekeepers, like many of the hotels in the city, weare actually not doing what we will say we will do. This also does not include the retaliation part. Is that correct?City Attorney That is correct.Okay. So I will be brief in saying that we can arm our housekeepers with panic buttons, but if they use them and they get retaliated against, they are no use to them. One of the conversations that we have had many times is Why do women not speak out?Why do women not break their silence? Why do housekeepers not go to their bosses and is because they do not have protection from retaliation? And that is something we have seen in our hotels in the city. So, again, we can pass this ordinance tonight, but if there's not a protection for retaliation, we are not doing our housekeepersany good. I have two other questions, particularly around public records request. What's the city's policy on Paris? What's the timeline that we typically get those back?So each period is different.The statutory requirement is that we respond within ten days of whether or not there are documents to produce. We had the ability to ask for an extension to determine whether or not there are documents that are available to produce, and then the peer statute says you have a reasonable amount of time to produce those.So some things go very quickly. If it's an easily identified document, we find it, we tell them we have it, and we sometimes produce it all within those ten days. Some praise take us months and months and months, if not years, to produce over a year, probably not several years, but at least over 12 months sometimes.If not years, 12 months. Can you give me an example of a PR that would take 12 months if it's a PR about emails?We got asked for any and all documents one time related to litigation on anything dealing with PCBs that the city has ever done and any water and and any data we have back to the 1930. So that took over a year, I'm guessing.So something along those lines.So a letter came into my. To my attention that there was a PR done on September 7th in regards to this item with entities related to the Long Beach Area, Chamber of Commerce staff, affiliates or agents including but not limited to attorneys.Long Beach Police Department and Affiliates. California Hotel and Lodging Association. Its staff. Affiliates or agents including but not limited to attorneys. Long Beach Hospitality Alliance. Its top affiliates or agents including but not limited to attorneys. Any third party.Any members of a Long Beach City staff, including city manager's office, city attorney's office and city clerk's office. How long do you think it will take for us to get that PR back before the people that requested this?I don't really have an estimate on time. So we get about 3500 press requests a year, and so staff do as best as we can to respond to each one of those periods. Some are quick, some take longer.I don't have an estimate on that one. I'm not aware of that one.Okay.So I think that my points that I wanted to make tonight before this vote happened was that I do feel unlike some of my council colleagues that this is political and the fact that the timing is not being negotiated at all, the fact that we're not adding third parties that are in there is political.The fact that there is not a retaliation clause is political. And I would love to know if in between the last time this council item came forward and now if we've had any conversations with the lobbyist or businesses that represent hotels of 15, 50 rooms or more as a an opportunity for them to use this.So it's very you know, I had hoped that reason would have allowed us to have this conversation after the election so that we could all feel better and we can make that clear to our constituents. And it's just pretty disheartening that we can't come together as a council to do something as simple as wait two weeks.Thank you. Comes from New England.Thank you, Mayor. At the beginning of this item here, the councilmember from the third district made some amendments to this ordinance. In the past, when we talked about amendments to any ordinances that would basically restart the clock. That is not the case in this situation here.I'm sorry. I didn't. I'm sorry.In prior discussions with about ordinances, when we have an ordinance brought me before us either for our first or second reading and there were additions or changes made to that ordinance, it would basically trigger a restart or re discussion or new a new amendment coming in to the city council with these amended motions or changes to anordinance. I don't hear that happening here. Is there a reason for that?Yes, Councilmember. And you are correct. When there is a substantive change that the public would not be aware of, then we would say that you have to start the clock over, start first, reading again. The item this evening and the changes, as I understand them, are in early delineations and changes to the language that exist so thatthe public is on notice of every said. There's no new sections being added. They're not changing the overall sections. They've changed some timing. But we believe these changes could be made this evening and you could have first reading this evening if the council so desires.Okay, so if today's a first reading, then they will come back to the city council at at a later date for a final adoption.Who would come back for second reading? I believe it's the 13th. The workload dark next week and dark on the Tuesday for the election, so that following Tuesday it would come back to the council for second reading.So if we still had some concerns on the 13th about this ordinance, as there is worry with the changes and the amendments that are there, can we still introduce other concerns that we might want to add or make other changes to the ordinance at that time?Yes, absolutely.Okay. All right. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Gonzalez.Yes. The impact analysis, it is dated October 11th. And can we can someone walk through that? Because although it's it's discussing the hotel ordinance that is on the ballot, I think it's pertinent to this discussion overall because it it goes over the impact analysis economically for us here in Long Beach and then also goes through methodology.And so I'd like us to just sort of walk through that a bit and in our findings and all of that because it just came to us in a two from four version.Well, I will do my best. So we if you remember, the city council requested to do a impact analysis and that the scope of which was sort of spelled out here on the council floor. And we did our best to implement that through a group called Bay Economics.It's somebody we have used in the past, as we have looked particularly about any hotel incentives to be able to bring high scale hotels into our city. And so the city council asked for it to be done in about 30 days.That was at its August 7th meeting. We reported back at that 30 day mark about where we were and quickly engaged by it ended up taking us about.60 days to do.That was for the methodology. It was really turned over to Bay. We gave them the scope of work. They interviewed a number of stakeholders from large hotels, small hotels, medium hotels. It was really focused.On the measure.It wasn't focused on this particular item, but rather on the initiative ordinance that was brought to us to both understand the the scope of it, the financial impact primarily to the city. In order to understand that financial impact, we needed to understand the impact of the various provisions on the hotels themselves.I concluded that some of the provisions would have very little impact or no impact, and it has financial conclusions which were very difficult to put into real dollars, especially in the short term, but did have some conclusions about the potential impact on hotels that have not yet decided to be constructed in Long Beach.They're under the entitlement phase but have not pulled the trigger to actually begin construction. It interviewed some of the, you know, samples, and there were confidential interviews of small, medium and large hotels, as well as the CVB, as well as Unite Here for to be able to get labor perspective.And finally, it looked at various other similar ordinances that were done in other cities to try to understand their experience of the implementation of the ordinance. And then that entirety of the report was presented to you and the public on October 11th via memo.Okay. Thank you. I appreciate you going over that a little bit. Okay. So with that and this is my main issue with this is that we we don't even have obviously WWE on the ballot. We didn't even have an ordinance that came back and we did a study which I think is fine.We did that. It was very in-depth. It was a third party and now we have this motel ordinance in front of us with absolutely no study. No information, no economics. We don't know. No business outreach and different from the polystyrene.And I will make that distinction. We did do outreach with polystyrene. In fact, myself, I went with my office to every single business improvement district to talk about polystyrene. So there's a difference in that. In addition, and I want to ask our city attorney this question when when the when the polystyrene styrene ordinance came before us, Ibelieve there were a few amendments that were to be made. I think that was on timing. And you had mentioned that it would start over the clock. So are you saying now the amendments made by council member. Price would not start the clock over.I.If I recall correctly.Seems very there seemed very stark to not do that.If I recall correctly. I don't know what changes you're referring to on the polystyrene, so I don't have that in front of me. These changes and why we don't think they start the clock is it's it gives the hotels more time rather than less time.So it is it from that perspective, they have additional time to do that so that it's more favorable to the.And we did that with polystyrene as well.And I believe that I'm not sure what we do with polystyrene. I don't have it for me.So it was a I believe at one and it was a we I think we had like a one year period and then we moved it to 18 months. And that started. You said that. We would have to start over the clock.Is that what I'm getting?I don't recall. I have to go back and look at the minutes from that meeting.Okay. So you're just saying now. So I just. So I'm clear. We're not starting over. She's going to go in first reading. Whatever happens tonight, they will move forward.That's correct. That this if the council approves this this evening, this would be first reading. Second reading would be November 13th. Additional changes could be made there that could start the clock over if additional changes are substantive and then depending on how the council decides to vote.Okay. I think everything else has been mentioned. The last thing I will just continue to to harp on is the just impact analysis. And I don't know if there's been any thought about that. Knowing that this is going to be a major impact, whatever happens.On the election with the election or even aside from that? Okay. I had one other just clarification, because we didn't take a two thirds vote to rearrange this agenda item. Correct.It doesn't require a two thirds vote to rearrange the agenda item.I thought it did because.This does not take the council and the chair can change the agenda unless and I mentioned this prior to the start of this, unless there is objection from the council hearing. None. He moved it forward. If there is objection and it's a motion in second and a simple majority can move this forward.Okay. Well, I didn't hear him call any. Point of order in that sense. Okay. Well, I think those are all of my questions. I think on the substitute substitute. I heard that. Thank you. Appreciate that. On the substitute substitute motion, I certainly will support that, given the additional amendments that Councilmember Richardson included.And we will go from there. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Austin.I have nothing. I'm ready to vote.Let's call for the vote. So who vote? I ask to come comments before.Public comment has already been asked for.Yes, it's already been asked for.On the substantive surface to substance.This vote is on the substitute substitute motion to write requested to from for in the implementation to outreach to small businesses and bring back after the election.Point of order is it since this a different motion than the main motion? Does it require new public comment.Or does not question?Okay.All right.Don't try.That's right. We just spent 5 hours.On shaky.Vote.Motion. Motion feels.Good.But the next vote would be on the substitute motion to receive and file.Cosby, Bill Richardson. Motion fails for five.We are now on the main motion as amended by the Council member from the third District.QUESTION Cannot an amendment to this is there? Is that appropriate?Not at this time.We've friendly member. It's not.Appropriate. You could certainly ask for a friendly amendment and.They have the option saying yes or no. Right.That's correct.I'd like to offer a friendly amendment that we still get the outline to the council, the two from form, what the implementation looks like and and ways that we can integrate both. The Nuisance Motel ordinance outreach efforts with this effort.I declined that at this time, but I look forward to having that come back as an agenda item on its own at a future meeting.All right.And we're voting on the name of. Of up voting on the main issue.It kills.Me when.A word. Really? Are you allowed to abstain?There should be a basis for the abstention.You know. Yeah.Took the point of order.Okay.It passed. We move on now.No.Motion carries five zero.Thank you. Now we'll start our hearing now. So the presentations.Coming to the.Commission, please.\nSummary:", "answer": "Recommendation to declare ordinance amend the Long Beach Municipal Code by adding Chapter 5.54 relating to hotel worker safety precautions, read and adopted as read.

Not even on the days that we're honoring you, but come on, hang out with us.We appreciate it. Thank you. All right. We have our last proclamation. Councilman Castro want you to go ahead and read Proclamation 419.Thank you, Mr. President. This is Proclamation number 419 series of 2018, declaring Wednesday, April 25th, as Denim Day in support of victims of sexual assault. Whereas every day women, men and children across Colorado suffer the pain and trauma of sexual assault upon survivors and our Colorado communities.And. Whereas, this crime occurs far too frequently, goes unreported far too often, and leaves long lasting physical and emotional scars. And. WHEREAS, during National Sex Assault Awareness Month, we recommit ourselves not only to lifting the veil of secrecy and shame surrounding sexual violence, but also to raising awareness, expanding support for victims, and strengthening our response.And. Whereas, sexual violence affects individuals of all ages, backgrounds and circumstances. And. Whereas, as a nation, we share the responsibility for protecting each other from sexual assault, supporting victims when it does occur, and bringing perpetrators to justice. And.Whereas, at the state level, we must work to provide necessary resources to victims of every circumstance, including medical attention, mental health services, relocation and housing assistance and advocacy during the criminal justice process. And. Whereas, Colorado communities can come together to increase awareness about sexual assault, decrease its frequency, hold offenders accountable, support victims and here heal lives.Now, therefore, be it proclaimed by the Council of the City and County of Denver, the City Council of the City and County of Denver declares Wednesday, April 25th, to be Denim Day in the city and county of Denver encourages everyone to show their support of the victims of sexual assault by wearing denim and participating in this showof international and statewide support of all the survivors of sexual assault. Section two the clerk of the city and county of Denver shall affix the seal of the city and county of Denver to this proclamation, and that a copy be transmitted to Laura Richards with the Survivors Task Force of the Colorado Coalition Against Sexual Assault.Thank you, Councilman Cash. In your motion to adopt.Mr. President, I move that proclamation number 18 0419 be adopted.All right. It has been moved and seconded. Comments members of Council Councilman Cash.Well, thank you, Mr. President. And I don't know that there's much more I could say more effectively than the proclamation has detailed. We obviously, as a community, must do everything we can to lend a hand to the victims of sexual assault, to bring their perpetrators to justice and to lend those victims support in their ongoing recovery.I'd like to thank Xi CASA, the Coalition Colorado Coalition Against Sexual Assault for their ongoing work in this area and for bringing Denham Day to our attention. Folks wanting more information. The idea is not that you just wear your jeans, but that for that privilege you make a donation to the coalition to help with their ongoing efforts. Folks wanting more information and a packet of Denim Day stickers to help publicize this effort can call 63038399999 or visit Colorado Denim Day, Dawg. And, Mr. President, I left off the w w w just for you.Thank you.Thank you. My pleasure. And thank you, Mr. President.I think we know what the interweb is. All right. Excellent. Thank you for bringing this for Councilman Cashman. Councilman Ortega.I just wanted to add a few comments and also thank Councilman Cashman for bringing this forward. We had an outstanding presentation last week from our district attorney talking about trafficking. Human trafficking and sexual assault is so much a part of what happens with human trafficking that occurs not just in this city, but across the country.I also had served on a nonprofit organization that worked with. Primarily women who are victims of domestic violence. But again, this was another situation where many of them had been sexually assaulted by their their partners. And it's it's so important to just keep this issue in the forefront.We know that sexual assault sees no boundaries in terms of age, race, gender. And just to keep the awareness and to ensure that we have resources and services for the victims is so important. So, again, Councilman Cashman, thank you for bringing this forward.All right. Thank you. Well-stated, councilwoman. All right. See no other comments, Madam Secretary, Roll Call Cashman.I can each new Ortega assessment. Black. Clark. Espinosa. Flynn. Hi, Gilmore. Hi, Mr. President.I Police Fields of learning announced results.11 Ice.11 ice for 19 has been adopted. Tell us when Castro. Is there anybody want to bring up?Yes, Mr. President, I would like to invite to the podium Laura Richards with the Survivors Task Force of the Colorado Coalition Against Sexual Assault.Thank you guys very much for this. My name is Laura Richards. I'm a survivor of sexual assault and a member of the Survivors Task Force. We're a coalition of survivors that go and testify on legislation such as the Human Trafficking Bill, which was one of the legislations I testified on Denim Day, just so you know, came aboutout of the a travesty of justice. A young 18 year old girl was raped and the judge deemed it not to be rape because her jeans were too tight. And we took.That.And we turned it into a celebration and a show of support for survivors.It's been going on since 2013.Here in Colorado. And I'm incredibly grateful that the council has adopted this proclamation and encouraged the support of the city of Denver to participate and show their support. Because we love to see your pictures, because we know each picture that you upload wearing your jeans means you believe in.You support us, and hopefully that will.Mean there will be one less victim next year.So thank you very much.Can you tell us one more time just for everyone, what day that we need to wear jeans?April 25th every year. It's the fourth Wednesday of the month in this month of fourth Wednesday of April. And this month it'll be April 25th.

The grant will help fund the acquisition of two parcels on the western shore of Sprague Pond at 024 Lakeside Avenue and Hyde Park. As a permanently protected parkland to be known as the Sprague Pond, Shoreline Reserve submits a report recommending that the orderof £2.Thank you, Madam Clerk. Council tells the President. Email you have the floor.Thank you very much, Madam Chair. On Friday, December 3rd, we chair to hear. I chaired a hearing on these two dockets. I wanted to thank councilors Braden, Arroyo, Flynn and Flaherty for their participation. I also wanted to note former councilor and current state representative Rob Consalvo also testified and offered his support.This is really exciting. These are two Park Fund program opportunities or funding fundraising opportunities. What is a $400,000 grant that will help allow for renovations at the Winthrop Park in Dorchester, Roxbury? Eldercare and Garran, the senior planner for Parks and Recreation, noted that the renovations for the playground will include a new basketball and multi-sport sport court, asplash pad and new exercise equipment with a paved exercise circuit, a refurbished lawn area for open play and new tables and benches. The renovations will also improve accessibility by meeting ADA compliance and would include new tree planting and plantings.There will be a net gain of eight new trees. The proposed completion date for this project is June of 2023. Docket 1146 is another park land acquisition grant in just under 400,385 $87,164, which will help fund acquisition of two parcels on the western shore of Sprague Pond at 024 Lakeside Avenue and Hyde Park as a permanently protectedpark land to be known as the Spragg Pond Shoreline Reserve. This is something that is really, really, really interesting. I think many of you know that this is the site of the encampment of the 54th Massachusetts Voluntary Volunteer Infantry Regiment.I believe it was the first regiment of black Americans who fought and fought in the Civil War. It's a place of incredible pride that it was in not only our city limits, but so close. And we will not only be protecting that space and really giving that space the reverence that it deserves, being almost like an outdooreducational classroom we firmly protect it from development, will make sure that we're able to get resources. And it's a really, really exciting not only environmental justice investment, but also historically historical investment. Joe Bagley, who is our city archeologist, offered testimony to support the historic, historical and archeological sensitivity for the site.This is without landmark designation, the city and state or federal protections. The city cannot enforce archeological preservation without acquiring the lands. One of the reasons why this is so, so important. So a vote on this would be a vote to accept the grant money which would then work towards an acquisition.We will not be voting to acquire the land at this moment. I am very hopeful that this will happen in very short order next year. But both of these dockets are incredibly important, incredibly transformative for our city. And again, I think we all I know everyone in this chamber is a fervent defender and lover of our outdoorspace in our Boston parks. There's a renewed sense of importance after nearly whatever. What are we at now? 20, 22 months of pandemic to see how important it is for to protect and grow these outdoor spaces. It's not only an environmental justice issue, it's a public health issue, it's a public safety issue.It's obviously a huge environmental issue. And in this particular case, as it relates to Sprague Pond, it's also a vital part of our history that we need to protect and preserve. So I urge you all through you, Madam Chair, all colleagues, to please vote in support of both of these dockets.Thank you.Thank you, Councilor O'Malley. Anyone else wanting to speak on these dockets at this time? Councilor O'Malley, who's the chair of the Committee on Environmental Resiliency and Parks, seeks not suspension of the rule, seeks passage of docket 1145 and docket one one for six will take them separately.All those in favor of passage of docket one, one, four or five say any opposing nay.

Obviously, I think with with the ability to schedule a Brown act, a Brown act, meetings, agendas and all of that as well. And so I just want to put that out there, that that was part of consideration in terms of the structure of the committee itself.I think there is. I also want to acknowledge the public concern around how people get selected and who's part of that process. I think it's difficult to figure that out. Ultimately, somebody or a group of people have to make a decision.I think part of this exercise for me has been about letting go and not dictating who's involved or what the outcomes are, but really surrendering to the community led process and allowing for as much input as possible. And for different individuals who aren't necessarily always involved in these conversations to be leading and framing the conversation.Thank you. And I just want to echo that. And also my thanks to Councilmember Vela and city manager, Assistant City Manager Bowden and city manager Eric Leavitt was in these meetings, too. But I. I would certainly like to see a robust ability for people to I don't know what email the city manager the assistant city manager andsay I'm interested. I believe people have already been doing that without even knowing what we're doing moving forward. But I hope and maybe Assistant City Manager can tell us more that the selection would actually be made by people of color advising you as opposed to staff.And we've heard a lot about how these decisions can be made. But I'm also really excited that I've been hearing from people who are not typically involved that I didn't even know before and just saying, I want to step up and be involved.And so anyway, it's there. And Assistant City Manager Bowden, did you want to do you want to just. Well, I should say I'm sure we have public comment and we should ask our clarifying questions and then we'll hear public comment and we'll come back for a discussion.So I see the vice mayor. Stand up. Vice mayor.Thanks. All right. I guess the one question I have that I'd love to hear from the steering committee a little bit more is I heard that going with this process allows this not to be a brown act. Buddy.And to me, the key aspect of the Brown Act is notification and making sure that meetings are public. Right. And that's and we can if we have to get into that, why we're being very vague, but we can't give any direction for this to remain this kind of kind of a body.Because I'm wondering if we can talk a little bit about that, because to me, I would have expected that this would be the kind of thing that we want very well publicized and noticed. And I'm not clear how the Brown Act is, is the thing we need to be trying to get around.So what I heard from some members of the community, some members of the community who reached out, is that there needs to be a certain size of each subcommittee determined because if it's too large, the ability for making decisions and having a.A full, meaningful discussion is is just diluted. And so and I don't know what that perfect number is. And again, that's one of those where I would defer to the people who are going to be involved, some sort that that they would like some time out of the public side to just bat around some issues, sometimes, youknow, sensitive topics that they might not always want to that that maybe until they've batted them around a little, weren't ready for public consumption. But it definitely doesn't mean that they would meet in secret and then come to the council.I think my sense of it is that these groups would somehow meet and form a council member. Vela has her hand up, so maybe she'd like to add clarification. Did you want to jump in now?I think there's a couple of aspects. One is the timing involved around getting agendas out and what that would require in terms of the lead time for them to actually agendas meetings and could perhaps hamper their ability to have a number of smaller meetings with various groups who might not feel comfortable speaking on the record in ain a public way. I think being sensitive to the fact that there may be members of our community who would like to have certain aspects of conversations be held in a in a smaller listening setting. And one thing I'd like to reference is for the truth and reconciliation process, is that some members of our community have suggestedor alluded to this is exactly what they did. They formed essentially listening committees, subcommittees that went out and did a listening tour and met with a variety of different groups, met them on their turf. I think there's other constraints around the Brown Act, where the meeting takes place, how it's televised, who has access to it, that sortof thing. The process that was followed in Charleston and in Colorado Springs, for instance, involved having essentially known these commissions committees who would go out and have these conversations again. They're not precluded from having a Brown Act agenda meeting.I think that would certainly I think that's falls within the line of some of the expectations that have been laid out, is that there be a transparent process, that they that they come forward and make presentations, that they have formal meetings as well.It's just that through this process, they don't have to do that for all of their meetings. Additionally, there's certain constraints in terms of how meetings are run. You can go out and have an informal conversation, let's say, with the youth or with a small group from an apartment complex.And the conversation wouldn't necessarily be stilted by having to limit or times have a discussion, that sort of thing. Obviously, they could have work sessions. We have work sessions where we we don't necessarily we can suspend certain rules, but this would allow for that as well.And so that's where we came up against those things and we said, do we want this to be a heavily bureaucratic process that has that might make it uncomfortable for certain individuals, black, indigenous people of color, people who have felt like they're they might not be ready to have certain conversations publicly.Is there a way for us to kind of look at this and create a place that they would be safe to participate or feel safe to participate while also having the ability to have these publicly agendas, very transparent meetings.And just to emphasize to the vice mayor's question, these were suggestions that came to us from black community members. So we were carrying them on to you. But the Council will give direction and input to the the city manager.Assistant City Manager.Well, so can I ask a question, please? Yes. My understanding is we can't give any direction to the city manager or this whole process falls apart.Yeah. Yes. The. Let's see. We are we're receiving a. City attorneys can clarify for us, if you would, please.I'm happy to provide a.I'm so sorry to.Provide.Suggestions.I highly encourage those not to be.Direction suggestions that the city manager could either take or leave is key because this is a city manager driven process is welcome to take input from the community, from the council, from anyone else who wishes. And at.The end of the day, he'll make a determination on how to form this group and then go forward and do the work that he will.Task them to do. And so suggestions are okay.Thank you. Did that answer your question, Vice Mayor? Okay. And other clarifying questions. So Madame Toni Councilmember, they said, did you have a hand up? No. Okay. And if I don't see it, I'm going to ask. So I would imagine we have some public comment.Sorry I was needed. So no one on Zoom has raised their hand. Now they're starting to raise their hand. Okay, so anyone on Zoom, please raise your hand. The first one is Melody Montgomery.And can you just tell me how many we have all together? Because that'll help us with timing.Sure. Melody has been the first to raise her hand, and then we have four written comments. So that's 3 minutes each because it's under 703 now. Now we have three people who raise their hands. So we're at seven.So it's 2 minutes each. Okay.2 minutes each. Hello, Miss Montgomery. Hi. Hi.Thanks again. I think my question is directly to the city manager or for guidance. How do we as citizens become involved? What is the process? Because I still haven't heard out. Heard it laid out directly. So that's my question.How we as citizens become involved in any of these committees.Thank you. That I know they're taking notes as that question and. Well, yes. And we can. We're listening. They are listening. Staff is listening.Were you.I think she was finished. Okay.Yeah, I think so. Yes, I think so.All right.Hopefully. Oak Grove. Our women. Brown.Good evening.Good evening. So I have two specific questions for, I guess, the city manager, which is one, this echoes some of the comments made earlier. Also. There seems to be a general collective unclarity about how to engage with subcommittees.And then this in particular is also unclear. So I'm wondering if you could release some very clear public document, maybe not written like a staff report, which is great for council, but less so for a general public, really clarifying the process in ways that's clear because even I still.Don't fully understand. And I've spent a lot of time reading and talking about it and also. And. What was the. Oh, and then a question is if how as the public at any point in this in the process, if something happens, you are the person able to hire and fire police.And this the various subcommittees are going to be making comments. But I'm curious how what's the pathway of engagement if, say, general citizens don't agree with what's happening with the subcommittees or if a city manager does not take the recommendations given by the subcommittees?That is not that clear either about what these subcommittees would do in terms of enforcement. Thanks.Next is Alexia Rocha.Hello.Hello again. I am concerned that weeks and we are looking at an appointment of a subcommittee that will then appoint various task forces that mainly seem to revolve around review and maybe data, but not enough action. I am also concerned about the amount of autonomy the city manager appears to have in appointing a subcommittee.There's already plenty of data and reviews regarding policing policies and racism, specifically in towns and cities similar to Alameda. So it's unclear why folks still feel we are so unique or immune to racist policing practices. The community has spoken time and time again, especially last week, regarding the resolution that disappointingly did not pass.This plan tonight has limited detail on how the community, the committee will be chosen and and the rest of the task force's. It's very unclear. It claims it's community wide, but there's no definition of what that means. Will these groups be reflective of the island's makeup?Will these groups be reflective of the marginalized communities impacted by these issues? Or will these folks be primarily those with privilege and access to the people who are choosing? For example, if folks are already emailing and that assumes that they have access and whatnot.I think that how much time there has been and the urgency needed there needs to be more clarity and this needs to be action oriented. Thank you.Thank you.Next is Jennifer Rakowski.Hello.Hello. Thank you again. I want to actually get a community member who has been very interested in this issue because I have been very impacted by the issues that these task forces and community groups will be addressing and that there is still this feistiness around sort of the different roles, the different authorities, the time commitment.And I'm particularly concerned for folks who are marginalized. They're trying to put food on the table. They may or may not be working still and trying to make judgments of how much time they can give that clarity of expectations and avenues for real, meaningful input from people who are most impacted gets through in what feels right nowlike a pretty bureaucratic process. And so I do encourage this move forward that, as the prior speaker said, that we move out of sort of these formal meeting minute type roles to have sort of real ordinary communications with our communities and encourage multiple levels of participation that have an awareness of constraints of economics, jobs and things thatmight be barriers to entry into the system for the very people who are most impacted.That's time.Thank you. Next speaker.That is all for Zoom. And then we will read the public comments. First is carli state of meaning? Hello, mayor, vice mayor and council members. Well, it has been almost two months since Molly Watkins was illegally arrested and the same amount of time since George Floyd was murdered.While other city councils around the Bay Area have already taken concrete steps towards reimagining public safety. The Alameda City Council is still discussing forming committees to appoint committees. Justice delayed is justice denied. The City Council needs to take action now to declare racism an emergency and start taking concrete actions to counteract racism in our community.I also am concerned with the current proposal to have the city manager be responsible for selecting all of the steering committee members who will then select the members of the various task forces. The Council needs to instead set up a process where the community gets to choose the steering committee members.I suggest doing so by having the council or city manager with community input select various local stakeholder organizations such as the League of Women Voters, the local ACLU group, the Alameda Point, Collaborative, local faith leaders or communities, and have each organization entity select a steering group member.That way, the steering committee will truly be community led. Thank you. Next to Seth Marvin. I'm writing to support the resolution before the council tonight to release Paul O'Leary from his role as Alameda police chief. The chief's got to go under Chief Roll Aries leadership.Alameda has only grown in reputation as a son downtown, meaning a place where people of color don't want to be caught after dark for fear of being treated the way Mr. Molly Watkins was treated. Is that the Alameda you want to live in?The videos clearly demonstrate and the district attorney has now confirmed Mr. Watkins was unlawfully detained and unlawfully arrested. He was also disrespected, provoked and then assaulted. Chief Roll Airey has taken no responsibility for this. He should have declared outright that what happened to Mr. Watkins was clearly unlawful and shameful.And this was only the most recent incident that was caught on video. The chief's gotta go. His inflated salary and benefits package alone should be reason enough. It's way more than that of chiefs in much larger cities. The chief's gotta go.Chief roll area also demonstrated he's willing to give the appearance of making sweeping changes without any input from the community or council. He's also demonstrated he's willing to use paid time to lobby the city council by soliciting emails from supporters and then forwarding them to the city clerk.We see that he wants to keep his power, to keep his status, and he wants to keep his budget. But he's also actively working to undercut much needed change within the police department. The chief's gotta go. His continued leadership of the Alameda police is a danger to Alameda.And. Next is Savannah Cheer. Good evening. While I appreciate that there were some initial efforts made to address transforming Almeida's vision of public safety. I'm very concerned with how these efforts are starting out. If this entire process was meant to be community led and sourced, how come the community wasn't engaged by the subcommittee?If that engagement is instead going to be left to the city manager and the formation of the steering committee. What was the purpose of the work done on this for the past four weeks? What are the specific ways in which you will amplify the needs and contributions of black Alameda and Alameda INS who have experienced harm frompolicing and have been most affected by oppressive systems? I am hoping that you will provide a great deal more detail in tonight's discussion. As it stands, what was published in tonight's agenda is insufficient. Coupled with your total bungle of last week's Public Health Emergency Resolution.Things are looking great in our city's pursuit of racial justice. As you've heard me and countless others comment in the past six weeks or so. There is no time to wait. Marilyn, you invoked the heroic and beloved John Lewis earlier and said precisely what I would like to know.If not now. When? When? I hope that you'll be able to answer that question tonight in your discussion of this topic coming out of this meeting, it should be abundantly clear when we're going to see action taken on divesting from policing and investing in our community.Thank you. And last is Dorothy Marvin. Dear City Council. Given that the Council agreed last week that racism is a public health emergency, I would suggest that health care providers voices are included in the steering committee. I further suggest that each steering subcommittee is comprised of at least 50% bipoc and that we compensate members of the steeringcommittee. This will help create inclusive structures that support diverse participation and avoid exacerbating the minority tax. And that's all.All right. So with that, I closed public comment. And I am always impressed with the the depth of the comments that we get, many of the comments that we get. And I wanted to just address a few things that jogged jogged my memory.So, I mean, I'm happy to hear more from the assistant city manager, the city manager about that. I know you were taking notes, but I think that the public asked some good questions about how is this going to be an open process for application.What I would say is this is the first time we've done something like this, at least in recent memory. There may have been previous councils, but not not in the time that I've been involved in city government. So it's an ambitious undertaking.I think it was Jennifer Rakowski raised some questions that we had. Councilmember Bell and I had certainly raised in our meetings with city management that what are the reasons? And this is something that the community members have spoken to us and I think or would like to be that the city manager had spoken with about.Taking the lead in this community members, not him is one of the the things that you look at if everything starts out to be Brown act is just the length of meetings. And so while tonight council we would have spent what 7 hours in a meeting, not all on this one topic, but any of these topics couldcertainly run a number of hours, especially with lots of public comment. Again, not to say never any public comment, but but if we've heard even people calling for let's move out of formal meeting roles to have real ordinary communication, I think that was the sort of first level that that people were interested in doing, however.So the time commitment is something we have to be respectful of. We knew what we signed up for when we went. We might not have realized the full extent of it, but we ran for office. But these are community volunteers.Councilmember Val and I would like to find a way that there be stipends paid perhaps to those who participate or meals provided. I mean, even though you'd be doing this from your home because we're not having in-person meals any time, if you know that there's ways to to be respectful around that.But anyway, what what other suggestions.That Madame Mayor and I think that direction was that that.Direction was expressly given by the Council at previous meetings where we authorized the use of stipends, making sure that equipment was available for people so that if they were going to do Zoom meetings, they would be provided with technology to do that and things like that.I think the council unanimously, I believe, gave that authorization in June. So I do want to put that out there for people that are trying to connect. How does all this fit in together? But I do think it would be helpful for staff to talk a little bit about the selection process, how people let let it beknown that they're interested, that sort of thing. And I know we talked about it within the subcommittee generally, which is kind of generally what that would look like. I do want to also address there. There's some people that are saying, can you just make the change?Now, it's hard to have it be a community led process as the council is just giving direction on changes. So I think this is trying to strike that balance. I also think, and I believe there was direction previously given about including black, indigenous and people of color and centering these voices in this process.And then also that, you know, there's on the one hand, people don't want politicians and electeds involved in these in these committees. They want it to be community led. And then on the other hand, or you know, and by the way, I got emails from people, I got, you know, calls from folks.That's who I heard from our people that reached out throughout this process. But if we if we as council start selecting individuals for who's involved, then it becomes this very bureaucratic Brown Act process. And for people that are concerned about timelines, for the community to get back and make recommendations through the city manager and to the Councilabout actions, concrete actions we can take, that's going to prolong the process.Councilmember Odie mean just a question through the chair. I mean there was a suggestion from I think maybe more than one of the four live commenters that the subcommittee involved. I mean, does that also entail as much bureaucracy and, you know, bring bring the process into the purview of the Brown Act?Or do you still have that flexibility? If we just said, you know, it's the city manager with the two of you or not? I don't know. I'm just asking.Let's hear from the city attorney, Mr. Shin.We believe that if any council.Members are involved in the selection process, whether one or two, it will be a Brown committee.And I would just say in answer to your question, Council member Odie, I, I have a lot of faith in who I think would be the steering committee to reach out. And I mean, well, not only to reach out but to receive any and all applications.And I think just because I just want to I do want to touch on something that Councilor Vella said that I know people want this done yesterday, but I just want you to know that we hear a lot about what other cities are doing.I will tell you that tonight the Oakland City Council is considering their task force to move forward with speed and diligence on reimagining public safety task force. That's the task force. And they have the following project timelines. September 29th, 2020 is the introduction of the task force and December 31 is the draft task force recommendations presented tothe Council March 31. I think we've what we've lined out, lined up what was in the staff report about short, medium and long term goals. Some things we can accomplish more quickly. Others take a little more time. And we've heard other members of this body say, you can do things faster, you can do things well, but youcan't always do both of them at the same time. Councilmember Odie.I'm going to when it's time for comment, I'll make my comment on that. But so then I thought the four live speakers, they all were good, but the four speakers ask them questions that. I don't know. Are we able to answer those?Because there is some concern about like who speaks for for who. And I'd like to make sure that, you know, the the voiceless are have an opportunity to participate. I mean, Melanie mentioned that both times that in her comments and, you know, her and I had a discussion today about it, I open open disclosure.So, I mean, that's a concern.So I'm maybe.You can talk about it.Maybe you can't. But let me out here. I'll listen.Yeah, I'm I'm pointing that to staff. And I am I do hope Ms.. Montgomery is going to apply in whatever format there is. But staff, I think we've come to the point where we could use a little information for you so we can make informed suggestions.Ah, but counsel. Oh, they are. There are 4 minutes left until midnight and I know we said we would go to midnight. Do we want to give ourselves a little more time on this item? The other option that the city clerk and I discussed briefly earlier today is that if we had to continue to another, can youchange the meeting to another date? Thursday of this week is a possibility. But I've seen shaking heads so. Okay. Councilmember Ody if with what to what motion.I'd like to at least go to the 1230 because I think we have some momentum on this topic and you know, we all are like, I know it's late, but I'm kind of engaged in it, so. Okay.So there is a motion to extend to 1230, is it.Yeah. And then, you know, maybe we can consider maybe tacking it on to Saturday or something.Oh.And the vice mayor has his hand up his knee. Okay. So it's been moved. It's been seconded. Any discussion since then? We have a roll call vote, please.Councilmember de SAG. I like.My.Own. I though.I.May be Ashcroft.I carry sci fi eyes. All right, thanks, everybody. KASELL, Brody, I think you were still speaking, right?Yeah, I'm in. I can just get my comments, then. Um, well.I. I'm sorry.Sorry. I think three of us now have asked the question of what the actual process would be, and then that doesn't include the the public speakers. Would it be helpful to hear from staff about how people can get community members got engaged?I didn't want to. Councilmember. Yes, that would be helpful. The council member already was in the middle of a sentence.So I mean, to the extent that that can be answered, yes, because, um, I'm going to be really brief when I say what I'm going to say. But I if we can answer that question, sure, I'll wait.Okay. All right. Who on staff would like to address the questions that you've heard the.Audience sell out all the attempt to answer it? Marisa Ashcraft And say council. And so I'm what I will the way I will answer it is if it was a city manager appointed committee, here's how I would visit it.I'm not trying to compare it to any other type of established committee, but just sort of how how I envision that is that there would be probably 3 to 5 steering committee members. I've it's been somewhat flexible at this point.And the reason it's somewhat flexible because I wasn't sure what this discussion tonight would produce. So you can't have anything definitive until you have the discussion. So I'd see 3 to 5. I'd see that starting hopefully appointments probably within the week.And then that would be starting. I as far as people wanting to be involved, I do not see that the committee would have I don't see that the committee would have what I would call designated people representing entities.I would see that people would represent themselves and that anyone would have that opportunity. And I think when people talked about marginalized individuals or individuals of color or just marginalized individuals in particular, that I want to encourage people to do it.And that's part of the reason I don't want to have people that represent groups or interest groups, but more people that represent their own views so that you have a natural, more community based approach. So that committee would be appointed and then I would rely on that steering committee to then or subcommittee to then make the decisionsas far as what I call task force. That's my term task force. And there's five or six areas that we're looking at. And then that could be very flexible people, could it? If you don't have it under this committee concept, if you under this committee concept, if people come in mid process, they could still add people midprocess. So if people find out about it through the process, they'd be able to be added. How do people let us know? I actually put my email here on the chat here for those that are still on here, but you email myself or the assistant city manager or the say manager's office.Any of those three emails or you could contact councilmembers and councilmembers to forward your names to us. Any of those would approach and I I'm trying to have a process to be more inclusive. That's how I would see as more inclusive and including different viewpoints.I think that's the way you would go. I believe the assistant city manager already laid out sort of the timelines that we're looking at, which have some consistency and probably a little more aggressive than what the Oakland timelines that were set out in the mayor's statement just a few minutes ago when you were talking about what wason Oakland's agenda. Hopefully that answers some of the questions and I can clarify more.And in addition to emailing you, can we also put something out on social media, different platforms that we you know, that where we reach people.Yes. The answer is yes. The question, Eric, I think he had to get up for your light. It was social media was we can we get it out on social media as well and other platforms like that? Yes.Yes, we can.Okay. Let's see. What. Were there other questions that. Oh. You know, I had one starring in to you, John. Vice Mayor, there were some speakers who and they expressed their concern with how you having. Oh, too much autonomy.And so what? Tell us what the city manager or city assistant city manager's role in this would be as far as any recommendations, what comes back to the council? Can you give us some information about that?So this process is is probably a little different than some processes in that people really want a community based process. And so that's where the appointment of the the subcommittee or steering committee, as I call it, would happen.And then they would be involving other I would be we would be a filter of getting names to them as well as they would also have names, but they would appoint those committees and then they would be looking to collaborate with my office and getting resources.So if they have questions, if they're trying to get data, there would be a flow and collaboration and support from my office. So that would be how I see it. But the recommendations that were being come in to my office would then be put together in a report and go to the council.It wouldn't be filtered. It's just that's the way the process. We're trying to have a community based process. At the same time as something that has a city element that brings back a formal recommendation to the city council eventually and so or and reports back to the council.And so that's how I'm trying to create the process. There were some other questions and I want to just steer to another thing real quick about Brown Act. So a lot of people when I deal with committees, a lot of people don't understand with Brown Act that understand the sunshine ordinance that so for instance if you havea committee so let's say one of these subcommittees has five or six let's say it has six people. If it has six individuals on it, some people don't realize that if three of those individuals get together, they've actually violated state law under a Brown act, because under Brown act, you have to do noticing if you're going toget together and talk about a subject. So if they wanted to have an informal discussion, they would have to have to do it. So there's a lot of rules and regs and sometimes people don't understand that. So this would give a little bit more flexibility while also involving the public and also trying to have a formalized processto get recommendations back to the council. Because ultimately, when you're talking about things like police services and you're talking about budgets, those will be city council decisions eventually between now and the spring of of 2021.And Tony has had a cancer day. So sorry. You've had your hand up. Sorry.Sorry. Yeah.Quick question. How do you envision the task force taking community input? Or is is the task was just going to talk among themselves over whatever subject matter there. What's what's the engagement?That that's a good question. And I think some of that has to still evolve and some of that has to evolve from how the task force believes it's best to be able to engage the community, or I call it the steering committee or subcommittee.We've called it three different names. But but the committee or the overall committee, how they get public input, I would want that to somewhat evolve from what they think are the best routes. So I don't have that predetermined at this point, but I don't see it that it would just be from within themselves.I don't see that as an option. But how they would engage people, whether it be through social media, whether it be through other means, I haven't predetermined that because I think you need to give a certain amount of that.They need a lot of autonomy. And that would be part of.The point is that they will and they just happen. Yes, they will. It's just how they do it is the issue. Okay, I get it right. Thank you.Hey. Did I face me? I was calling on you, but I might have been muted.I have some comments that I had another couple of questions. I've heard a couple of times that there were people who informed. Who are the people who informed this process? I'm curious.All the people the same age she's been talking to.Or the subcommittee talked to you about the subcommittee. You both have mentioned that you've spoke to people who gave you the advice and curious who was.That.Will give them the conversation, I think. Okay. Who's informing?Why do I keep doing that? Okay. So I can.I can list people. I've talked to a number of people throughout this entire process. Rashid Shabazz, Robbie Wilson. I could you could you could do I could send you every email that everybody sent me about this topic as I've read through those.John, you had recommended that I talked to Shalom. I talked to Shalom that that also informed it. I think that, you know, I listen to public comment. I mean, I could literally I think probably hundreds of people have kind of informed the process for me.I haven't had specific conversations about who's going to serve on different committees. My recommendation has been for people to email, and so that's what I've done.I'll jump in. Most recently last night I had a Zoom meeting. The youth activists of Alameda asked to meet with me via Zoom and and I told them that I hoped they would apply to be on these subcommittees because one of the things I've been doing a lot of reading about what other cities and not just inthe Bay Area but in other states, because this is this is happening around the country, which is a really good thing. But they do talk about the need to have representation of typically underrepresented people and not just somebody who knows someone.And so one of the two individuals. But I think there's a third I guess I'll throw out the name and they can tell me if I'm wrong that I reached out to because I was so impressed when I heard him on your town hall this there was a gentleman named Al Mance and he's with the public defender'soffice, Alameda County, and he was interested in helping guide this process. And he knows Joleen, right, is someone who's in the community and oh, I'm lips. You know what? I guess I've been steering this discussion so much that I'm out of time that I was just informed.I'll tell you more if you vote me.So I will move to waive the time.Okay. And you would second that.Can.Okay. Maybe we have a roll call vote, please.I'm remember they said not. Not. I O.D..Uh, let's just try to keep it short, though.I vellum high.As the.Ashcroft I and I will. So al-Mansour was interested in then Joline Wright is someone that he he knows and she's that there are parents of school children and they know each other in various ways. She she's an amazing organizer.And I think she's a she's an operations manager for an architectural firm. And man, she runs circles around me as far as organization and then a name that was mentioned for one of the steering committee people. But again, I have not been involved, so I don't know if they've connected with the city manager, but it was ChristineChilcott, who is well known as the executive director of Girls Inc of the Island City. And so I think and what when I have gotten emails from people saying I want to be involved, I'm forwarding them off to the city manager saying, you know, put these in in the file.But I don't you know, I would never want it to just be people who know to email a councilmember. So that's why we want to get the word out far and wide. I would say that I do think that the people who have been following these discussions and attending these meetings and speaking are really natural constituents.And I take copious notes and there's a number of your names you can always say, know that we'll try to hopefully will be will be contacted. But I I'm just like I said, I'm excited about just doing something that we haven't been done before, but spreading the word far and wide.Councilman Brody, was it who's who? I mean.I can just go out. I'll just make my comments and then I'll turn it over back. It's really not for me to decide who's who the leaders of the black community are. It's not for me to decide who the voices of the black community are.I hope that in selecting people that our staff has heard, for example, the four speakers that spoke live, this agenda item and that has spoken to other agenda items and real and recognized that that's going to be a challenge.Um. I'm going to quote an African-American mayor, and I hope that it's better than the last one I did. I read an article where the London breed was interviewed talking about her Vogue interview, and she goes, I want people to respect the opinions, the feelings of black people, and allow us to decide what is in our bestinterest. The black community is capable of speaking for ourselves and deciding what's in our best interests. And she went on to accuse white progressives of projecting beliefs onto African-Americans and stating that many progressive policies historically backed by whites in San Francisco have not worked for the city's black residents.So what that tells me is if I say, Oh, I would do it this way, or No, I would prefer that, or maybe you should do it that way, or I should be critical of that. Or No, that's not for me to say.It's not for me to project. It's not for me to say, you know, this policy should work, uh, or, you know, pigeonhole the committee into a certain direction. It's me. Step back and listen and let the community process take its.Take its place. Because, you know. It doesn't really matter what I think. It's going too fast or too slow. It matters what the people who are most impacted. You know, whether it's going too fast or slow. So I'm not going to be critical of anything until I hear what they have to say.And then I will use the levers of power that I have to accomplish what they're asking. But in the meantime, I'm going to step aside and not try to project what I think is best for them. And on this community, I want to hear what they have to say.So that's kind of where I am. And I appreciate the work of the subcommittee, and I hope that the city manager and our staff has listened to these comments that our commenters have been making over the past few weeks about this.And let's the black community in Alameda tell us who their leaders are and who should represent them and let them decide what's in their best interests. And, you know, not white people.Thank you. I just have to say, when you were quoting what London Mayor Breed said, one of the young women last night in the youth activists of Alameda said something very similar. Vice mayor, were you next?Sure. So I have an issue with this not being a brown act body. And with the exception of the noticing, which I think is not a problem. I don't think the other issues that were were highlighted is why it shouldn't be a Brown act are really that amnesty.I mean, I think that, you know, a committee can have subcommittees and that subcommittee can meet in without violating the Brown Act with small groups and get input when there are sensitive conversations that need to happen with groups that don't want to come to public meetings, etc..But I think setting up a process that is supposed to be very public and transparent and bring everybody in, bring the entire community into this conversation. I think setting it up where it's unclear when they're meeting and who's meeting and where the the committee members themselves are meeting as a majority, possibly without notice, because they're just havingconversations and developing answers, I think is kind of problematic for me. I am struggling because on the 29th we heard last week about, you know, we unanimously appointed a subcommittee and gave some direction on what we'd like to have come back.And what we're supposed to come back with by the 31st was, you know, kind of a subcommittee, some community objectives and goals and a work plan. And we're three little over three weeks past that, and we don't have any of it.And so I'm going to reflect a little some of what we've heard from the community about the what is going on. We don't seem to be moving forward. And my concern is that we are slowly getting to the place where we're really probably not going to have real recommendations in time to have the budget conversation that wecommitted to having in October. I will be really surprised if these subcommittees are really up and running before the end of August because of how long it's going to take. If we're really going to do this, I don't know how we can appoint the steering committee made up of a broad group of community members who don't knowthat this steering committee is going to be done in the next week. So I've heard a strong commitment to making sure that we have a have a deep pool who have been pulled in for this conversation. But that's going to take some time.You know, I think we need to be also clear because I've heard some confusing comments. You know what, we gave direction on and what came back to us tonight is about policing. And not a broad overall conversation about systemic racism in the entire community and everything that falls under that.And so I think that we are we are having conversations about conversations that need to happen. But I think that we need to be clear as we move forward with what the scope of this is. Personally, I would like to see us give some very specific direction to the city.I want to be really clear. I have no problem with the city manager making this decision. I have no problem with him empowering a committee of community members to take this and run. This is not about community or not, but I think that, you know, giving some real strong guidelines of expectations is one of the goals thatwe have in this in terms of, you know, how we would like. You know, I'm kind of this considered. And I think also, you know, I would like to have some commitments to timelines for when things are going to be done.And well, you know, there are some check ins that may be happening. They are not we don't know that they're going to happen. And I think some of them are we should talk I don't know with what is this check in in September going to look like if the group is just starting to meet and engage thecommunity at the end of August and early September. So, you know, I think I don't know how to do it, but I would like a commitment to the to the steering committee. And if the subcommittees are going to be independent groups working on their own, that they you know, I would call it a steering committee and thenhave committees and then you can have subcommittees on the subcommittees that can go out and have non Brown Act meetings when when those are needed. But the community will at least know that the committee is not meeting in secret in the old backroom of all these days, you know, with the way the way we used to doit. So, you know, that's that's kind of where I'm coming from. I honestly feel a little frustrated that after the conversation last week that that we're still kind of trying to figure out how to how to even start moving forward.It feels like we've kind of gone backwards from the 29th at this point in time to starting all over again. So I guess I'd like to hear their maybe just their maybe majority support to move forward, and that's fine.But, you know, if we can't make a commitment to having this be an open and transparent process with our actions, I won't be able to support it.And I just want to call in Councilmember Vela, but I just want to point out that one of these subcommittees is about addressing systemic and community racism and also anti-racism. It's not all about policing, although I'm sure it's tied up in there.Councilmember Vela.And you know, I just want to address a couple of things. There are a lot of resources that go into having publicly agendas, notice meetings. We have to have staff present. We have to agenda is that we have to make sure it's not at a time that conflicts with council or any of our other committees.They have to then agree to the meeting, date and time, get it posted ahead of time so there is no impromptu. We're going to have able this group can meet next week. We're going to go meet with this group next week.I don't think the intent here is to not have a transparent process. I think that's been made abundantly clear not only by this council that that's the expectation, but by the community. And I think that if we end up with a process that does not include publicly agendas, meetings, that does not include opportunities for community input, andwhere the task force essentially nobody knows what they're doing and nobody knows who they're meeting with. I think this is going to fall apart really quickly. I think it's going to fall apart basically before September. So I want to put that out there.We always have the ability as a council and frankly, if we wanted to, we could agenda something for September to say, you know, if we if we want to do to say, look, we want to have a very transparent process and we're going to all now start picking people, because I think this goes back to who isdoing the selection and how do we go about doing that and who is making the decisions about who's in the room. And I I'm of the mindset that I do not want to be the one making the giving the direction about this is the goal.I think I've heard a lot of different things, frankly, from the community, all sorts of different things from from various community members. And I think the whole purpose is to allow them to goal set. And I you know, I would also add that I think and this is something that I've struggled with, is how do we makethis a transparent process, but how do we also allow for and stretch our resources to allow for the most meetings possible and things like that? When I'm looking at other cities and seeing what went into their reform processes in terms of how they got the feedback, it was a process that wasn't confined by or expending resources onlike, you know, 50 different meetings that were all televised and very formal. They went out and they had these informal meetings. And I don't know that there's the same benefit of speaking with a subcommittee of two as there is with actually having these meetings with a full subcommittee.So I think, you know, and this is something that I struggled with was how do we create this process in wanting a transparent process and warning of a place for people to just to go to to have a voice, is trying to figure out how do we do that with the resources that we have and how dowe expedite it? Because I do think there is an expectation that they will make recommendations before our week before we meet in October. And again, if they don't come back with, hey, here's some short term recommendations that we have, I think it is going to be a problem.But. But I guess my question to staff is, is there a way for us to get report backs and updates in terms of the progress? So if we don't like it, we can come in and create a formal council led process that's subject to the Brown Act.And before IT staff. Simpson To answer that, I wanted to also just add on to Councilmember Velez addressing both remarks. Sweat's concerns. I do understand, Vice Mayor, the Brown Act is a very important principle. I don't believe that any of these subcommittees are going to be doing backroom deals that will somehow be to the detriment of thecity. But I understand the principle and why it exists, but I am wondering if and again, I really want to respect the process of hearing from the community and letting them lead. But I think the benefit. So what I will say is maybe there's a hybrid approach, maybe that initially the you know, maybe all the groups gettogether, all the applicants, I don't know how they want to do it. And then somehow people must self-select or they I'm sure different individuals have different areas of interest that they have of subcommittees or working groups, whatever they are that they want to serve on.Perhaps it would work if and again, this is just suggestions to consider that an opportunity for committee members to get to know each other because I'm I'm assuming I'm hoping that people will come together who've never met and and then have that opportunity to to get to know each other, get to feel comfortable talking among each other, not necessarily in the spotlight. I find when I'm dealing with the youth that sometimes they're amazing, but sometimes some shyness sets in and you might not hear from them. And but then perhaps after some initial meetings of getting together and goal setting and and, you know, figuring out and again, setting their agenda.But within the the framework that we were wanting to be advised on, then maybe it transitions over to Brown Act. But I just it it is it is just something that I was just trying to respect suggestions I heard from members of the black community.Councilman Brody's got his hand up, please. Thanks.I mean, I didn't hear when you all made your presentation that this was going to be a process done in secret behind closed doors. And I believe that by the time before anything comes to council, that there's going to be some public vetting of it with the people that are involved.Otherwise, it's not going to have any legitimacy. Right. I mean, we have the privilege to sit here for seven and a half hours, you know, and we also have the benefit of, you know, in some cases 20 years out of council or being on committees, you know, boards and commissions and understand.And we also have, you know, a very large and capable staff behind us. We are asking the community members that have none of that. Now was the time. Not the privilege, not the time. Not the staff to be involved in this process.And there have been a lot of brave people come speak that I am fairly sure. Well, first of all, they hadn't spoken before, right? I mean, there were stories, you know, I heard at some of the marches that, you know, were teary, teary eyed from the people because they'd never spoken those stories before.So, you know, to have them have to give their name and show their face, you know, at the first time they speak, that it can be overwhelming. And I think we want to get the best input possible. And the most real experience is from our communities of color, you know, experiences that I don't have and I'll neverhave. And none of us really will because none of us are black, to be honest with you. So we're never going to know what that's like. So I'm I wish we had some flexibility in the Brown Act, but, you know, to me, the Brown Act is, you know.Forgive me.For.A bunch of it's passed by a bunch of white people, you know. So, you know, why are we going to wish that on our communities of color?Councilmember Brody, I am getting the text from the city clerk that it is 1228. We can do a couple of things. Council. We said we go to 1230. We are meeting again on Saturday. This that will be our prior two setting workshop will be Zoom, but it won't be broadcast.On the other hand, this was an opportunity to give the city managers suggestions. Perhaps we feel that we have. But quickly, in 2 minutes, tell me what your what your pleasure is. I guess I've heard from Councilman Brody.I've heard from Councilmember Vela. Councilmember de SAC has his hand up.You know, I just want to make a quick 22nd comment. And my 22nd comment is simply, you know, I find myself hard pressed to support a process that doesn't actively notice the public and engage the public. So, you know that that would be an important issue.You want to make sure that that was part of the process?Yeah.Okay. All right. Any further suggestions before we run out of time? And do you want to come back to this on Saturday or have we given enough suggestions?You might. Oh.Yes.City manager if for continuing email. Although I.Regret. I'm not sure we are. I'm not sure. Let me. Let me hear from the council, please. Council.I you don't. I mean what you guys want is, is a non action so there's no vote to be taken. So I won't call a vote, but I'm not supportive of moving forward in the direction that is proposed.You would like to see more Brown Act involvement or a total ban?I don't I don't believe the Brown Act causes half the limits I've heard tonight. So.All right. Okay. I. And I'm not sure that I think continuing more of a discussion. On Saturday would make a difference. I think maybe we have to see what comes out of this process and we can still refine it further if we don't feel that it's working.Staffed. Okay with the process, by the way.Thank you, Councilor Rody, and I think two others of us are too. But I understand this is it is a leap of faith. As I said before, we have never done anything like this before. And, you know, you want to proceed carefully.Did you have any any clarifying questions from staff before we adjourn? I'm going to assume you're unmuted and just have nothing to say. Okay. Vice Mayor.Jumping to the next item, are we going to get that guy?Well, it's 1231, but I don't.Want to start right now.Okay. All right.So comment, give, give.Is that being continued? Is that being.Continued to Saturday?Yeah. Shall we continue that to Saturday?I just.Yes.Okay. The. Yes, Councilmember. I mean, I'm going to make Mr. Levitt a member of the council. City manager Levitt.Yes, I, I what I was going to recommend is you may want to think of moving it to different day because Saturday with the agenda for you have in front of you, we're looking at 6 to 6 and a half hours just for the agenda you're looking at.That's the concern.Yeah.Crime. I'm just concerned. Adding an item like that. Well, we'll extend it further.It's not a quick item. Okay. We could do one of a couple of things. We could go a little longer tonight, but maybe that's not advisable. And then, as I said, the city clerk mentioned that Thursday is a possibility Thursday evening.Councilmember Vela, did you have your hand up or your muted your muted.I would like to make a motion to continue tonight's meeting until 1240 so that we can make a decision about continuing this other item.Oh, okay. Because we're out of time. Okay.I will. Second, Councilmember Abdullah's motion.All right. May we ever recover, please? To ever think that.I.Next like.Hi.Odie.Hi.Hi, Mayor. As the Ashcroft.I.Carries by five eyes. Thank you.Okay, so who's got the floor?Matt Amaya It seems like there's two options. One is to continue it to Thursday, the other is to continue it to Saturday. For this, the third option, which is to continue it all the way to September, as my understanding.Or a city manager. Or am I muted and a city manager?Or you could continue to a third complete. Like if you wanted to continue to the first week of August or something, no.One's going anywhere.You could do that, too. That's a that's a fourth option.Yeah. Thank you.No meetings next week either.Next week we talk about this item or the next meeting's item.The next meeting's item.Okay. Thursday doesn't work for me, but I'm happy with any of those.Okay. Um.I have a conflict on Thursday as well, but.Okay. Um. Well, I mean, we do have a full day Saturday, but we could maybe say on. You're fine with.Sweat.I'm fine with either Saturday or finding another day next week. But I do not want to wait until September for this.Yeah, I agree with what his next week look like. So we we could do this. We could ask the city clerk to poll everyone about a date that works for us for next week.We need you have to we need to.Continue to a date certain. So. So why don't you pull us now?How about next Tuesday, which is a Tuesday night that doesn't have a council meeting?Let me chair.I could do that. But we've done with the other item, or is that in limbo?There's no action taken. There's no.Action.I thought there was a we were supposed to.Say, oh, you're not allowed to play action.We make suggestions.Okay. It said, accept the report so we don't have to vote to accept the report.Do we need a vote to accept the report, Mr. Shen?My recommendation is that you do not.Take a vote. Okay. Okay.Okay. We could do that. Okay. Harris. Tuesday. Excuse me. What were you saying, Councilor Brody?I said we'll accept The Hague.Look at that advice. That was easy. So then we're looking at. Can't see my calendar. Tuesday will be the 28th. Okay. Is everybody good with that? What time?I.Phys ed. Yeah.Early.It does.Do it. Let's do it.5:00 o'clock. That works.Okay.And for those listening, it's still no public comment, right?Because I know public comment was closed last time. It does get opened up by moving to yet another date. Okay. City Manager Levitt. Yes, sir. But you have to unmute. And you're.Right. I am.Here you go.It. This is not a barrier to having on Tuesday, but I have a conflict with another city meeting that I have to be at between 430 and six. So. But that's fine. I don't need to be there for that.Is that is the assistant city manager available?I think he could be.Okay. Well, and I don't I mean, I don't know that we need them, but. Yeah. Okay.So yesterday, was that the. Hey, you just threw me under the bus. Look.The assistant city manager is good with this stuff. They, um. Okay, so I think we are ready to adjourn, so we need a vote. Oh, we need.A vote.Because we do. Yes, we do. So do we have a motion to make?A motion to do this? I Oh, yes. The final item to Tuesday night, next Tuesday, the 28th at 5 a.m., 5 p.m..Mean. Okay. The vice mayor has made a motion to have a second. Somebody. Come on, guys, we don't have time. The second from Councilmember de SAC. Oh. All right. It's been moved by the vice mayor, seconded by councilmember deaths.Any discussion? Seeing that we have a roll call vote with.Councilors based on. Yes. Next site.I.Odie.I.Vela. I may as the Ashcroft.I.Carries by five eyes.Okay. So we will see you all. A week from today. Well, the week from yesterday.Saturday.Yeah. Well, yeah, Saturday. We'll see. See everybody on Saturday. All right. Um, I think we're at the end of the meeting, right?Little over time.All right. We're under 40.Yeah, just.It's not quite, but. Yeah, but we voted to extend. Okay, so as I noted in the beginning, we will adjourn this meeting in memory of Congressman John Lewis. All right, everyone, thank you for your good work tonight. We covered a lot of territory.I know it was a long meeting, but you don't often see 12 page agendas. I hope not to see one again any time soon. All right. Good night. We'll see you Saturday.

We need a second council. It is being moved and seconded. Public hearing on 253 is now open. May we have the staff report?Good evening. My name is Sarah with CPD and I will be presenting the rezoning at 3401 Pecos. It is a request to go from PUD number 27 to see MPI two with a waiver from a maximum height of 75 feet down to three stories.45 foot is in Council District one in the Highlands neighborhood at the corner of 34th and Pecos, about three blocks east of town. The property is little over 34,000 square feet. It's an existing structure that was previously used for education and nonprofit uses.The rezoning request is to use the existing building for missionary housing. The height waiver requested on this case is to bring the maximum height down to three stories 45 feet. No other modifications are included in this waiver. This is the second case in recent months where the maximum height of 75 feet in the two district within 175feet of a protected district has come into question. After research, CPD agreed that the existing maximum height is not necessarily compatible with the intent of the district, which is to be applied at small embedded sites. As a result, CPD is committed to a future text amendment regarding the copy to district, and therefore the waiver is consistent withCPD's waiver and conditions policy. The campus education districts are intended for educational uses and facilities, as well as other types of civic, public and institutional uses. This to district is intended to be applied to smaller and medium scale campus sites, generally adjacent to single unit two, unit townhouse or rowhouse.Residential zoned districts where it's important to require more space and limited building height than this to II district to ensure these adequate transitions to the lower scale residential neighborhoods. In addition, certain land uses with the potential for offset impacts are more strictly limited in the capital district, such as restrictions on multi-family housing, lodging and laboratory research anddevelopment. The current maximum height allowed by the puti is actually higher than the requested waiver. The current maximum height is 50 feet and the waiver is down to 45. The proposed use would actually be permitted under the current Pudi.However, there's a square footage restriction for the residential portion. That's not sufficient for the intended user. And a more detailed summary of the Pudi was included in the staff report. The zoning surrounding YouTube to the west, north and south to the south is another old cut and to the east is YouTube.To surrounding land uses are a mix of single-family duplex and the current. The beauty to the south is showing up as mixed use because it is a religious assembly as well as a monastery use. The current context, low scale multifamily.Summary of the notice. We received the application in February. Planning Board Public Hearing was March 20th with a unanimous vote of recommendation of approval. Planning Committee moved it forward on April 13th of the appropriate are our and those were notified and we did receive a letter of support from the Highland United neighborhood.R.A. Which is in your packet. The first criteria consistency was adopted plans. We have comprehensive plan 2000 Blueprint, Denver and the Highland Neighborhood Plan. The request is consistent with various strategies identified in the plan. The Blueprint. Denver calls for single family duplex, which is a moderately dense area.The proposed zone district with the waiver, will maintain the character of the existing neighborhoods. It's intended for small scale campus uses in these low scale neighborhoods. The form standards and use limitations as well as the proposed height waiver.Height waiver will ensure development is compatible with the existing character. The Highland Neighborhood Plan describes this area as a predominantly single family, low moderate density residential area, and the suggested land use is to retain this low density residential.The request will respect the existing low density character due to the intent to be applied in these small scale sites, as well as with the height waiver. Staff concludes that the proposed map moment will result in the uniform application of the CPI to zone, district, building, form, use and design regulations, with the exception of the requested waiverto a maximum height of three stories 45 feet. However, the waiver provides better integration with the surrounding You Tube Zone districts and is consistent with the CPD policy to use waivers in situations where the waiver helps to solve an issue that CPD is committed to resolve through a future text amendment.Staff also finds that the requested will further the public health, safety and welfare, primarily through the implementation of adopted plans. Justifying circumstance in this case is that the land or its surrounding environs have changed or is changing to such a degree that it's a public interest to encourage redevelopment of the area.And CPD finds that this criteria is met. The copy to district is intended to be applied to small and medium scale density areas. And given this, the overall proposed rezoning is consistent with the urban neighborhood context that exists in the surrounding area and with this to purpose and intent.Overall, CPD recommends approval based on finding that all of your criteria have been met. Thank you.Thank you. We have two public speaker two speaker for this publication, Robert Sasse and Mark Trimmer. So, Robert, you can come on up. And then followed by Mark Turner.Ah, good evening. My name is Robert Soares. I'm an architect with Tito's architects representing the honor, the Archdiocese of Denver. My address is 5400 Greenwood Palace, Plaza Boulevard, Greenwood Village, Colorado. I'm here primarily just to address questions, but I did want to make a couple of comments in representing the owner.First of all, this particular reuse of this school for the creation of city missionaries will essentially be a place for them to reside while they are serving the community in the downtown Denver area. And they will also utilize this as a chapel and classroom area for educating the missionaries who are residing there.The former school that was there had a playground area that is now basically just going to be a very quiet area where we will have kids playing outside. The intention of the building with its reuse is not to add on to the building, but just basically respect the existing character of the neighborhood.And finally, the other thing that's a nice advantage for the neighborhood is because we won't have a loading and unloading zone. All of those wonderful parking signs can be taken down that that the neighborhood can park there and they can park there as we have a very small parking requirement for only 16 stalls, which we will haveoffsite. And they really don't intend to use more than about half of those anyway. So anyway, I'm here for your chance to address any of your questions. Thank you very much.Thank you, Robert. I'm sorry. Mark Trimmer.My name is Mark Turner. Obviously 3430 Quiver Street, my neighbor, directly to the west of the post change. And all of the neighbors support everything the previous speaker just said. We think it's a great use. The problem we have with it is the 45 foot.An elevation, which is basically increase in 15 foot. It's our understanding could be wrong could answer this question is that the existing building can't support another story as it exists now. And in addition to that, if it goes up another story, the setbacks come into play and changes the.Feel of the general neighborhood and that you can go two blocks and three blocks and most directions look back. And that will be definitely higher than anything that you see with the exception of some church steeples. So we think the waiver is too restrictive and not restrictive enough in that in the need of future expansion, the neighborhood. Well, let me speak for me since we didn't do a petition or anything as requested as could have been done, is that we think that more coverage of the lot should be considered as a waiver as opposed to just codifying a 45 foot there, that there's better options to get better architectural design and proper massing to fitthe neighborhood that things better. So sum it up, definitely support the use that they're going for and have always been good neighbors since I've been in the neighborhood. But we'd like to see more leeway so there could be a better conversation on how the property could be redeveloped as opposed to being.That's only considering height on the redevelopment. So that's it. Thanks.Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That concludes our speakers. Now time for questions from members of council. Councilwoman Ortega.Thank you, Mr. President. So, Mr. Sass, would you mind coming to the microphone? So just to be clear, the expectation is to use the existing building and not to add anything on to the site. Is that correct?That's correct. We don't intend to change the footprint. The only modifications actually really being made as a as a street access for safety issues that the building department requested. As we're going through the the plan review process, we've made that modification.But we don't intend to add to the heights of the building, increase the footprint, change the the exterior expression of the building.I'm assuming you need to do some interior improvements.Yeah, there's a.Lot going on. Yes, exactly. But. But as far as the outside of the building, we we don't intend to change it. The archdiocese basically has owned the building from the get go. They don't intend to sell the property.They just want to reuse the facility that they have and repurpose it.What's the maximum number of people that can be in there at any given time?There will be essentially 40 residents in the facility that will be on the upper level and then the lower level will be utilized for there's there's a kitchen in there that'll be utilized as well as a little cafeteria area.And there will be a chapel there. There are offices will be in that particular area and also be a chaplain classroom.And will the missionary be used, utilized year round?Yes.Okay.They'll be rotating people. They typically will be on site for a year. And then other than then, they'll bring another group in. So how it works is college kids doing this?Great. I have no further questions. Thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Espinosa.Actually, a question for you again, Mr.. I didn't even write your name. The architect from Adios. Can you if this goes through, can you make sure that the owner, the archdiocese, somebody from the ownership can contact my office?Most definitely.I'm I am. I do want to know, when we had a prior campus rezoning, we actually had a real good way forward for this, for the community. I think that would probably work here if we get in that situation.Now, that'd be wonderful.Thank you.They'd love to connect.Thank you.And then I have one question for CPD. So how do we. Did you maybe you mentioned this, but how do we get around the minimum area required? Because for a CPA to I2, it is a six acre minimum.Unless it's adjoining and exists, there.Is no minimum area for a rezoning from an old code zone district, and it's an old.Computer. So it's a waiver for the PD. Okay. Um, could we consider, since you're doing text amendments, take it back to CPD. I go that we actually reduce the area requirement to go to campus rather than a six acre requirement.I think that minimum area requirements are already on our list of things to consider for various reasons. So all of them will be looked at.Okay. Thank you. And if you want to go ahead. Yeah. So I'm Kyle Dalton with CPD. I would just add, you know, we have a list of that that currently numbers about 250 possible text amendments and and the minimum area requirements are one on the list.We don't know yet if that will be in the bundle tax amendment, but we plan to do this year or if it will have to wait for future years because of other priorities that we need to work on.But it is on our radar and we would like to to revisit those in the future. Thanks. Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Any other questions? Two, five, three. CNN. Public hearing is now closed. Time for comments. Councilman Espinosa.Yeah, I just this one was I just could have been contentious. So I want to thank CPD for and I don't know which came first the the text amendment or this rezoning issue. But I appreciate the flexibility in approaching this waiver request from the Highland Neighborhood Association, because it is it is a appropriate compromise for that siteand that location. I respect your concerns. Fortunately, there is a significant piece of property that is a buffer between your your property and this parcel.Mr. Jimmer, if if if you're going to rebut, please come to the podium.There is a significant buffer. That's true. The height really doesn't particularly affect me specifically, and that's really not my concern. It's more the architectural design on the corner that the other neighbors are worried about the height.Yeah. And so there's that there is that future with by right. Concern. And so specifically, if this rezoning goes through, that's actually what I would intend to discuss with the owners going forward is is how we address that with the community impacted.So with that said, again, thanks again for the waiver because it would have been really hard to understand how this was appropriate without that. But that makes a huge difference in this community. So thank you. With that, I will be supporting this.Thank you, Councilman. Any other comments? Two, five, three. Seen.

We love our special events.They make our city what it is. But at the same time, I think the level of public subsidies and the public cost to special events was really becoming a point that we really needed to examine at the Office of Economic Development, reviewed and looked at other cities and best practices throughout the country, and found that.In fact, our fee structure.Was out of line with what others charged. There was a series of meetings of the of the.Committee to look at the different.Options.Available.

We created a two year gradual phase in an introduction to the fees.Kept the fees so that increases would not be exceed 10%, as well as measures to look at the program after the first year.

We're doing item 13, please.Item 13 is communications from Councilwoman Price Council Membership Opinion Councilman Andrews Council Councilmember Ranga Recommendation to requires city manager and city attorney to draft an ordinance to prohibit pedestrian access to medians that are less than four feet wide or located on streets with a speed limit of 35 miles per hour or more.Thank you, Councilwoman Price.Thank you. I know I have some residents who arrived here at about 4:00 this afternoon for this item. So I'm thankful and I'm hopeful that they'll come up and give some comment if they are still here. But this is one of the items that I'm happy to be bringing back.Traffic. Traffic medians throughout Long Beach are dangerous places for people to walk, stand, sit, advertise for businesses, raise money for nonprofits, walk dogs or any other activity that is done while not in the process of legally and safely crossing the street.City staff issued a report earlier this year that that made it clear that some medians are not appropriate for standing and cannot safely accommodate a walkway due to insufficient with height, traffic speed, large traffic volumes and lack of accessibility.In the report, they further determined that the traffic safety concerns are heightened when speeds reach certain levels. City data and traffic studies throughout this country confirm that the risk of a fatality drastically increases for pedestrians when vehicle traffic around pedestrians has speed limits of 30 miles per hour or higher.The fatality risk increases between 3.5 and 5.5 times from 30 miles per hour to 40 miles per hour, meaning the risk of a pedestrian being killed at 30 miles per hour is relatively low. The fatality rate is nearly 50% at 40 miles per hour, and 79% of pedestrians struck at this speed sustained serious injuries.It doesn't matter what you are doing on the median. The median is not a place to stand at high speed traffic intersections. So as the city continues to work to improve pedestrian safety and make way for Vision Zero.This is a common sense policy that I urge my colleagues to support. Thank you.Thank you.Councilmember supervisor standing in support.Thank you, Councilmember Pierce.Thank you. I want to thank my colleague for bringing this item forward. I did have some questions of.Public works that I see.Mr. Buck here. Yes, I did. I know that we recently approved our Vision Zero contract to start pulling together that group. I wanted to know how we feel that this impacts that Vision zero work.If this is in alignment with that.Councilmember Pearce. I think this is in line with Vision zero one. One of the elements that we don't have yet completed is the safety study. So if you recall last week when we came forward and had a conversation about Vision Zero effort, one of the first components of a Vision Zero effort is to identify what are ourworst corridors, where do we find the most instances of vehicle and pedestrian accidents to occur? That information would certainly help inform how this ordinance would move forward.Okay, then I would ask my colleague, is there a time frame that you have on this?I'm sorry. Councilmember Price.I'm sorry.Once it's approved, the city attorney's office would commence drafting the ordinance.And that would be correct. But as Mr. Beck said, we would need that safety study to verify and justify the ordinance before it came back. So we would be working with public works on this recommend if it is approved this evening based upon the information we received from the safety study.So it may not come back right away, but it would come back after the safety study.Great. Thank you. I just wanted to make sure I know that we've spent many years talking about our vision zero.Hopes and dreams. And for those that don't know, Vision Zero.Is to make sure that our streets are safe.For everybody and we have zero.Traffic incidences. And so I just want to make sure that that is in alignment with that.So if it is, then I will support this item.Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Andrews.Yes, thank you very much. I fully support this item.Great councilmember area.Given that there was an accident, fatal accident not too long ago in my district, right around Long Beach Boulevard. And Wardlow well, the individual who was struck was not on the median. He was an individual that consistently was on the median.He just wasn't at the time of that accident. So I am fully supportive of this this ordinance, and I hope that it goes forward. Thank you.Thank you, Counsel Juan Gonzalez.Thank you. I appreciate this as well. To make sure we, of course, get to Vision Zero. I also wanted to see if we can include in I don't know how if this would be possible, but we have people that are constantly on the metro rail line as well.And I know we've had a lot of discussion with that. Of course, we have our metro representative here, as in our mayor. But maybe just as a another caveat within this ordinance, we can just work closely with Metro to ensure that people are not getting on, that the tracks, they're not jumping over the fence because it becomesa huge issue as well. So thank you.Thank you. We're going to move on to public comment a public comment on this item. Please come forward. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Good afternoon, city council members. My name's Gay Shelton. I live here in the first district a couple blocks from here, and I appreciate this item.Public safety is, of course, one of the reasons that we're here. However, it mentions here that the staff report that was issued last September, I imagine, was a two from four. I'm sorry I never had a chance to review it dealt with the feasibility of these actions, and the report that we have in hand says nothing aboutfeasibility. So I'm curious about it. Feasibility to me means cost. And when it comes to public safety, maybe cost isn't something that we care to talk about, but feasibility when we're talking about spending public funds to do such things as I would imagine would be required to prohibit people being on these medians, would be landscaping, fencing, bollards, maybe, and the maintenance and and so on. That goes with any signaling that might have to be added to intersections or areas where there's where there's median strips, lighting, perhaps striping. That would change. What we're looking at is something that that we don't know how feasible it is in terms of how many thousands, hundreds, millions.Who knows how many dollars would have to be spent in order to do this? We also don't have any sense from the public's perspective of how much of an impact there actually is. Where are their median scripts that are less than four feet wide?How long are they? Are we talking about only at intersections or for miles and miles where there might be a narrow median that would have to be somehow protected from from pedestrian occupancy? So if we're really going to do this, I think the public deserves to hear something about the costs, about how many miles of medians havebeen identified, just what this is all going to look at. Again, we understand the need and it's simply repeated in this in this document. But the public is in the dark as to the feasibility and the cost. So I do appreciate hearing from you guys any questions that you might have for staff that could illuminate us onthat. Thank you very much. Thank you, Nic. Speaker, please. Stephanie Dawson, CEO, Democratic Socialists of America, Long Beach Branch. As we discussed, as Councilwoman Pryce illuminated, this particular ordinance has been pretty much constructed in a way that makes it almost bulletproof to any particular challenge that would happen from, say, for example, the ACLU of Southern California asit's been constructed in a to provide a what's the word? Again, I'd rather describe it. It lacks a discriminatory intent. However, the discriminatory impact of this law will be unavoidable in combination with the recent prohibition against the bike shop, baking bicycle shop, chop shops and other type of actions that are being there designed specifically to be ableto cut off revenue for homeless people. I mean, this is by doing this, we are essentially facilitating the removal of these folks and making them come over to a next city while doing so under the pretense of public safety.If right now, I mean, if you're applying for general relief, that's going to be under 50 bucks. If you're applying for Social Security disability, that's going to be, what, $600 a month or so? You know, people need a way to be able to live, especially with the rising costs of rent in Long Beach, which I think we'llbe discussing later. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Heather Jordan, when I appreciate counsel bringing this forward.And the concern for safety that has been outlined today, if only we were more concerned with the that the people who this will mostly affect, you know, besides this ordinance. You know, I've seen the fences go up on seventh and seventh near Bellflower and PCH, and I've oftentimes close to Long Beach Boulevard and Wardlow.So I see the people who are out there on those medians there. You know, Councilmember Price listed a lot of people who might be on the medians, you know, nonprofits. But the the people that she didn't talk about are the people who are most often there are those that are houseless, people without homes, people who are tryingto earn money. And I'm all for safety. I'm all for keeping them safe. I think they do deserve that. But on top of that, I think they deserve other things as well, like a roof over their head.So I just want to make sure.That whatever happens when we implement this, that the people who are there aren't going to be severely punished because if it's a fine or something like that that they're given, these are people who can't pay that literally cannot pay that.So I hope when we move forward with the safety ordinance, we keep those people in mind. Thank you very much.Thank you. Next speaker, please.He has told us what is good and what the Lord requires to deal justly. The same God of the flag. We are saluted tonight. One nation under him, he has said to deal justly and to love mercy. The people, my clients.I knew that they were the subject. They are the only people that are on the media and by and large, the homeless. You don't see a lady nursing her baby on the median. No one coming from the grocery store with the flowers in the hand on the median.It's the homeless. And some of you are running for re election. You said you were going to represent everyone. Yes. Everyone in it is offensive. But you have not probably shaken one hand of the homeless. One hand. How can you?How can you? That is not justice. To now say to these people, we don't want to say, you asked for money. We're not giving you a nickel of our spending. We don't want to see you with a sign asking for a nickel.It's why you're saying it. God sees it. That's what you're saying. Guilty. Your local charity. Don't give out to panhandlers. But there are no local charities where those signs are posted. The mediums is all they have. And I will continue to take food on the median.Matter of fact, I'm going to start printing up some signs. Give these people your dollars because it's against the law for them to ask you in jail to say, give to those who asked, to give to anyone who asked you.I am defending the cause of the poor. Some of you said you would do it. Where are you now? Yes. The shame is what it is. We have officers surrounding him with guns and sticks and they will protect you.I was protecting the homeless. I mean, protect like the officers with their weapons. It is offensive to that God you saluted tonight. It's an offense.Thank you, Mr. Bouchard and the speaker, please.Well.I think you guys said you represent the public and everyone with a balance. So I just wanted to say that my name is valued. My address is on record. This is my 47th wedding anniversary in a heck of a way to celebrate a wedding anniversary today.I was not going to. I was I was not here to speak on this. But when I noticed that.We have two parades in this city every year, that people jam on the medians. This may be left unsaid, but we need to make sure that.We protect those people. During a Belmont Shore parade and the Veterans Day parade that when they're on the mediums are not breaking the law. So there's got to be some type of exception to it, I would think. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Hi. My name is Liz Waites. I would just like to comment.On a particularly disturbing and frankly sickening trend that I've noticed.Not in Long Beach.But also it's happening in.California, is these very thinly veiled attempts at shoving the homeless away out of sight. I noticed with the CSC or the Public Relations Department, there was some sort of collaboration about let's teach people to not give money to homeless people, give it to shelters.And I don't know if you guys have got the memo, but shelters are pretty brutal. And I just have to say the intention is transparent, the intention to force people out of sight and to not deal with them.You're not fooling anybody. And it's cruel and it's sickening. And I really you are here to represent everybody. And just because the homeless people out there cannot, like spare $20,000 doesn't mean that they are not worthy of protection.Thank you.Thank you. That concludes number public comment on this item. So we'll conclude public comment. I will go on to the rest of the council. Vice Mayor Richardson.Thanks, Mr. Mayor. And I just wanted to chime in and I you know, I tend to agree that meetings aren't the safest place for things to take place. But I think the audience raised to two questions that I would just like for city staff or the originator motion to speak to.So first, Mr. Lurch, thanks for raising the issue of the meeting. And so we want to make sure that we protect, you know, whatever whenever the street closures and and we actually have the opportunity to engage that meeting.We used it really well this last year in the Veterans Day parade sort of a line things along the median food trucks, things like that. So first I want to just address that. So, Mr. Beck, is there a way that we can make sure that we really take an accounting of when we do utilize the media andmake sure that's reflected in this?Y would defer to the city attorney, but I would imagine we could easily add in special events would be excluded from any provisions that get written.I would agree with that. I think that the the ordinance and when we talked about when we would the delay in coming back is the safety study that's going to be conducted has to justify both the location and the action that the ordinance would be taking that to show that it is truly a safety issue and it'snot a pretext for removing people from medians. So you're not going to have all medians qualify for this. It'll depend on the safety engineer and the safety study to justify the location.That makes a lot of sense. And then so the second thing I'll just raise, which was raised raised by the community here tonight, I want to make sure that we're not taking a step toward penalizing criminally or fining for creating a perpetual system where people can't pay the fine, but rather figure out ways to make medians saferand and sort of a discouraging activity. In the meetings, for example, we had a lot of activity on Jordan High School, people running across the street from Jordan to the apartments. They lived across the street and we wouldn't use the crosswalks.So we just built a nice decorative treatment in the median and people respected the crosswalk respect meaning use the crosswalk. So I would love to see industry, I would love to see sort of public works best practices utilized to achieve whatever is the best outcome so that there's no appearance that the intention here is to sort ofpenalize any particular group. And I know and and I would assume that that's not the intention here. Thanks.Thank you. Councilman Austin.Thanks. And the first mayor, you actually stole my my thoughts here because I was going to say, I think the makeup of the motion, the intent here when you look at the language here, is talking about traffic and, you know, speeds of high speeds of 30, 40, 50 miles an hour.So I think the intent of what what is being proposed is to deal with traffic safety and prevent people from being hit by by vehicle vehicular traffic. Secondly, I think, you know, to your point regarding the treatment that near Jordan High School, I think more of that needs to be done.We need to engineer traffic safety measures. Well, we know we have have problems or potential problems. And so I'd like to see more of that type of those type of solutions on top of this from from our public works department.So just thank you, Councilmember Pearce.Thank you. I just wanted to echo the same concerns that my colleagues recognize and anything that we can do to beautify the areas instead of just putting up a fence that we have some best practices and that this comes after, again, Vision Zero.I know that that Vision Zero will help guide us to make sure we're doing it in the right corridors and the right median.

I ever commented here was in support of the United Nations Initiative to Protect Women, March 1st, 2016.And I remember, in fact, that it was Councilwoman Price who sponsored that. I think by now you know how deeply I'm dedicated to the welfare, well-being and safety of women. I've been active in the American women's movement now for over 50 years.I'm an era and Alice Paul scholar. When I moved here, I met Claudia's parents. I began to pick it on Ocean Avenue with the women telling the truth about sexual assault in the city's hotels. And for the first time in my life, Time magazine agreed with me on something.They were truth tellers, and actually they were here earlier tonight at that first council meeting addressing Claudia's law, one of the council members mentioned his concern that adopting the hotel housekeepers concern would dampen the booming party of the Grand Prix.You can only imagine what I thought when I went home that night. Have a fun weekend. See a race. Assault your housekeeper in the friendly city of Long Beach. After your testimony and city council majority entrenched in voting against women's protections, the people spoke.And I'm filled with inspiration by the wholesome heart of the vote of the people. I stand here and in bold enough to thank you and welcome you to the right side of this issue. For all women, no matter the size of the hotel, no matter the circumstances, no matter the management.Because you see, as I told you three years ago, women hold up more than half the sky. Women carry water from shore to home all over the world, across the globe, women bear, feed, clothe and educate the young.And you tonight care for the sick, the aging, the dying, your mothers. Thank you. The grandmothers of all directions. Thank you. We stand together in the clear light of day that you have protected. All women tonight. And I'm here tonight to say thank you very much.Thank you, senor. The public comment. Councilman Price.Well, just just.For clarification, this item is about hotel and motel panic buttons and nothing more, which I will say every council member was always in support of.

I move the council resolution 20, dash 187, be adopted.Thank you, Councilmember. It has been moved and seconded comments by members of Council. Council Member CdeBaca.Thank you, Mr. President. Again, to reiterate what was said earlier, this final addition was really to get at the spirit of what group agreements are all about and make sure that when a new body comes in or new members are added to the body, we have a timeline where we can sit down and have a discussion aboutthese in a holistic fashion so that you're not hearing these kinds of amendments in this format. I think that this is important to the future and the changing of the body and would hope that you all support it tonight.This is one I hope doesn't need too much conversation, but I've been wrong before.

Would it be the president who does it or would it be the council secretary? Can you just talk sorry to Brigette Wonky. Can you talk to me about process, what this looks like?Who keeps that 90 day stopwatch? It would be the 90 days is to give us a timeline, but less formal than a stop clock on a contract. It's Hey, you have a new body. Within three months, we should probably sit down and have some kind of group orientation about how we want to engage with each other ina respectful way. So I imagine this could pop up in maybe our second operations committee as a group, seeing as how that's an ongoing meeting and a place where these were originally discussed, it would make sense to revisit that.Councilmember Flynn.Thanks, Mr. President. I move that we re re refer 20 dash 187 to committee to actually refer and not refer because this never this is the first we're seeing it and this is not how generally we should be amending things.I first saw this on Friday and I have no idea what the thinking behind it is. There needs to be a more robust discussion as a as a group and not here on the floor, because this is our weekly legislative meeting.I don't know if this is a good idea or not. I have I've had some discussions with a few members. How would this work? Some positive. Some negative. But there's been absolutely no discussion of this at all until this moment.And so I think this needs to be referred to committee. Thank you. Thank you. Make that motion.Thank you, Councilmember. It has been moved and seconded on the motion to re refer to committee, so we will now take comments and questions on the referral. Councilmember Gilmer.Thank you. President Clerk I would like to I would be supportive of re referring this to committee. It's not that I disagree that after 90 days a new body would schedule a meeting and start talking about the the rules of council.But I would like to also look at an annual review of the rules of council as well were kind of piece mealing things back and forth. And you know, once we see the new council, I don't want that 90 days to pass and then we don't ever revisit it again because things change.And so that's the reason I would like to re refer it back to committee so that we can have a further discussion about what that might look like and allow us to also review them on an annual basis as well.Thank you, President.Clerk Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember Hines.Thank you, Mr. President, because this is relatively new for all of us. I'd be curious about scheduling too. I know for the first 30 days we were worried about when when I took office, we were worried about desks, computers, phones.And then the next 30 days we were in speed dating with the various mayoral agencies and then the budget. And so I I'm certainly interested in making sure that we make sure that our process is sound. I just haven't had an opportunity to look at 90 days.And when I first took office and other new council people will have the same or similar issues when they take office. So just throwing that out there as well. Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilmember. All right. So nobody else in line. I think, you know, it's clear from the conversation that there are lots of questions and worthy of a conversation and a debate. And I think that that's appropriate to start in committee instead of here.So I will also be supportive of re referral.

The city has owned these properties for since about 2003, along with the intention of a future city park.The rezoning request would go from IMAX five, which is an industrial mixed use five story and you oh two, which is a billboard overlay to OSA, which is the most common zoned district for a city park. The purpose of the request, it originated from the Parks Department and like I said, city owned land to accommodate a futurecity park for a rapidly growing area and right now and to implement some some adopted plan. So subject property is annex five. Surrounding properties also IMAX five. And then going up from there and number of stories to eight and 12 stories to kind of reflect how that area is really booming.Existing land use is industrial, surrounding properties are mixed, but mostly industrial. You have two breweries and a dog daycare adjacent. So all you could ever hope for in the Reno area, properties outlined in yellow and these images. So you see it's adjacent to South Platte River corridor.It's actually on the the side of the corridor that has the trails is a great opportunity for kind of a flow into the the river corridor images of the subject property. So you can see the current condition used for Denver Police Department fleet services and other maintenance facilities.And then looking at the surrounding area, you see the mix of industrial and you start to see the boom happening in Reno and some of these images. I'm closer to Brighton Boulevard. And then looking at the surrounding area.So this is looking right across Arkin's courts. You can see the proximity to to the River and the Trail Network there presenting a real opportunity. OSA, the zone district, this being requested is intended for city owned land for future use as Parker open space.And like I said, it's the most common zone district you see for parks, including some nearby parks too. This one, St Charles Place, Globeville Landing. The process of followed our normal rezoning process is starting with an informational notice, and January Planning Board did recommend approval unanimously on February 21st.All the Arnaud's in the screen were notified of the request and no public comments have been received to date. And these are the criteria staff used to evaluate the request. So there's several adopted plans or citywide plans and local plans.But I will go to this pretty quickly because they are all the exception to the citywide plans. They all essentially point to the future use of a parker open space on the site. But in terms of citywide plans, certainly a lot of current plan policies and guidance related to encouraging development of parks in areas with increasing demand, which is clearly is seeing a lot of multifamily going in in this area and not a lot of park space to correspond with that. Blueprint. Denver has most of the site as a park and in an area of change.And then looking at kind of the most focused adopt the plan guidance the 30th and Blake stationery plan from 2009 does call out all these properties as a park and feature open space. And other plans echo that that aren't quite as focused in recent on related to the subject properties but they do call out a park andopen space on these properties. So I'm not going to go through each one of these. But in terms of a justifying circumstance, just to highlight that, again, a rapidly growing area with a rapidly increasing demand for four park space that transformation, staff finds, is a justifying circumstance for this particular zoning.So staff does find or does recommend approval based on those criteria, and I'm happy to answer any questions.Great. Thanks for the presentation. We have two speakers this evening, Sloan Nystrom from ADC. Come on up for 3 minutes and Chairman COO, uh, 3 minutes.Hi. I'm Sloan Nystrom. I'm here.Representing Parks. And I'm here. Just answer any questions if anybody has.Any questions about construction or the park.Thank you. Chairman Seiko.Yes, Chairman Sekou. Black Star Action. Movement for Self-defense. Oh, we enthusiastically support this. You know, it's rare, very rare on zoning changes that we've agreed on anything. Finally, we reached common ground. This park makes sense for no other sets of reasons stand on its own, meaning all the criteria and whatnot, and also the amenities that it providesfor the neighborhood. And the truth is, it looks a whole lot better than the pictures. I just saw them for real. Unless you're talking about wildlife situation, then you know I did that and then let it go. But that was a beautiful addition to that, an increased property values and also make this place, especially in that area, rhino that's more civilized so that it no longer looks like New York City. We ain't got no grass and we've got all these buildings going up and this ain't it. This is Denver. And it needs to keep this character because that's the attraction here.We got green grass, we got trees, we got parks, and we have safe neighborhoods that kids can come and play even when the park closes after dark. So thank you very much for your leadership and bringing this forward and.Look forward to seeing the growth. Thank.All right. Time to spare. Okay. This concludes our speakers questions by members of council. Have a quick question for for you. I was shocked to see you focus on the 2000 938 station area when we just did the 30th in Blake Station area, only because I think we did call out parks in that.So did you not find information in that plan to speak to this.In the 38th and Blake Yeah. Plant yeah there's there certainly is. And I was just referencing the map.Got it. So some more than this, more just, you know, to your presentation. Why why would you focus on 2009 when we we just worked as a community to consolidate those plans to have the 2006 to supersede those?That's a fair that's a fair question. The in looking back on the slides here, this one had at least in terms of the map, this one had the clearest sort of and included all of the boundaries as a park and the other ones carved out chunks as staying sort of industrial, light industrial.So while it's not more recent in dates, you know, it it is more accurate in the sense of the map at least maybe.It proved your point harder is more clear. Maybe I should.Say. Okay, okay.And I'm just asking is that's probably why you. Okay, it's just interesting. Okay, great. Councilman, you.Jeff know, snap. You know, I love Parks. I'm a big fan of Parks. But this is the second week in a row where we've given city land, you know, for uses. And this is a good use of parks.But was there any consideration for affordable housing? I mean, this is an enormous 3.2 acres of land. Was there any discussion at all about using this for even a higher level of affordable housing, workforce housing or anything like that?I don't know that there was. I mean, these plans, it's really based on these plans and the community conversations that happened, you know, in 2009 and 2015. And so that would have been the place for those conversations. But I'm not aware of any plans unless Sloan knows of any other.Look.I think the city purchases specifically for parks.When do they purchase?It's been said to do.Do you have the year that it was purchased?I believe it's 2003. There's three parcels and each one was acquired in different periods, I think 23. And then more recent from there, we've acquired all of them.So it's a it's a little bit of a different kind of scenario. But this this part of town obviously doesn't have any parks. And so this has been a plan long in the making for this.Yeah. Thank you.Yeah. Councilwoman Ortega.Thank you. So, having been the previous councilperson person, this district, it's been the bike shop and the repair shop for many, many years. But the plans for it being a park have been part of the discussion over the last ten years, at least as part of all the new development that was going in into the Brighton corridor, knowing that was a new growth area, we're going to see a lot more new housing development coming to the area. The question I have is where is the bike shop in the maintenance facility moving to and what's the timing of that?I do not know.Do you have that information? Can you come to tell us upfront?They're moving to the post building and they're supposed to move out this summer. It's slated for July.So when you say the post building, you talk about the Denver Post building downtown.Yes.So. We're going to have the bikes stored inside the car. I don't have.All the information on.That. I can get it. Can we get that information? That would be extremely helpful. Would be helpful to know the timing. And where specifically does the bike shop?I definitely do know the timing is July.Okay. Sure. Thank you. If you can get that, I appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. Chair.All right. Seeing no questions. Public hearings now. Closed comments, members of council. You know, this this this rezoning is exactly how it is supposed to line up. You heard Councilwoman Ortega when she was a councilperson in this district before me was during my tenure.I know she was working on this before her was Councilman Ortega. This has been something in the works for a long time for this part of the city. And, you know, I think a city growing as fast as we are to have us dedicating park land in space at this moment is is actually profound.And it says a lot about the values of the city. So I'll be supporting this, but I only want to just be supportive because the park but it matches up the criteria matches up with what we are supposed to approve.So excuse me, I hope that my colleagues will support this as well. See no other comments. Madam Secretary. Roll Call.Black Clarke. Espinosa. Flynn. Gilmore Cashman. Kenny. New Ortega. I Susman. Mr. President.I police the voting announce results.11 eyes.11 eyes. 243 has passed. Congratulations, everyone. Okay, we are on to our last council bill of the evening. Councilwoman Gilmore, can you please put 244 on the floor?\nSummary:", "answer": "A bill for an ordinance changing the zoning classification for 3400 Arkins Court, 3460 Arkins Court and 1930 35th Street in Five Points.\r\nApproves an official map amendment to rezone property located at 3400 Arkins Court, 3460 Arkins Court, 1900 35th Street, 1930 35th Street, and 1950 35th Street from I-MX-5/UO-2 to OS-A (industrial, mixed-use to open space) in Council District 9. The Committee approved filing this bill at its meeting on 3-13-18."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nYes, Mr. President. I move that council bill five oh to be placed upon final consideration and do pass.It has been moved in, seconded the public hearing for council bill. Final Two is now open. May we have the staff report? Good morning or good afternoon. Good evening.Mr. President.I'm Andrew Johnston. I'm here at the Department of Finance on special districts and I'm here on Council Bill 502 Series 2014, which is an an ordinance to approve the service plans for the creation of the JCC Metropolitan Districts, number one.And two, the service plans for the JCC Metropolitan Districts. One and two are being submitted for the City Council approval on behalf of Globeville One LLC, pursuant to the requirements of the Special District Control Act, Title 32 of the Colorado Revised Statutes.This are these districts that we're going to hear about today have been a true collaboration between the Adams County and Denver County as the metro districts are located on a site that is the former Asarco smelting plant site, with approximately 80% of the project being located in Adams County and 20% located in Denver, generally located at thenorthwest corner of East 51st Street and Washington, running north to East 55th Street. The development will not have any residential development and accommodates only commercial and manufacturing development within the district's physical boundaries. The service plans address public infrastructure financing on the multi-jurisdictional, multi-jurisdictional site districts one and two are located in Denver and are the service plans pendingfor approval tonight. The service plans of districts number three and four are concurrently going through Adams County approvals process and should receive final approval on July 22nd. The service plans of Adams County are substantially the same as Denver's service plans.Adams County has agreed to include Denver's requirements of prevailing wage, smaller disadvantaged business enterprises, discrimination and public art. The districts will be responsible for coordinating the construction operation, financing and maintenance of all the improvements the JCC metropolitan districts have.All the powers of a metropolitan district described in Title 32 of the Colorado Revised Statutes as limited in the pending service plans. The financing plan specifies that a debt cap of 50 mills for debt and a total debt cap for all four districts not to exceed 25 million.The service plans anticipate 9.6 million of estimated infrastructure cost, utilizing only 40 mills for debt and issuing bonds to fund the infrastructure over time, including principal and interest. The service plans also anticipate levying ten mills for operations. The district's proponents are aiming for a November 2014 election for district creation upon approval by property owners in the districtsat the November election and the court order, the districts will have the authority to operate in a manner prescribed in their service plans, city staff recommends and approval of Council Bill five or to the applicant. Their representatives and city staff are here tonight to respond to your questions regarding this Council bill.We will hear quickly a presentation from the developer and via finance group Cameron Birch, Ron and Sarah Laverty are here. The law offices of McKee de Cisneros, including Cassie Affirmant and Megan Becker, are here, and the city attorney's office.Karen Adolescent Nathan Lucero also worked on this project. Now we'll hear from Cameron Bertrand. The presentation, Madam Secretary. And. So.Thank you, Mr. President. Members of City Council. My name is Cameron Bertrand. I work for Enviro Finance Group and our company, Globeville One LLC is the applicant. Our company is located at 475 17th Street in downtown Denver. We are a Denver company, and I just wanted to provide a brief bit of context around the technical portions ofthe metropolitan district that Andrew just brought forward. Enviro finance group is a company that is Denver based. We're headquartered here and we specialize in what we call brownfield redevelopment. We acquire, remediate and finance the redevelopment of environmentally contaminated properties.And it's always exciting for us to have a project in our own backyard, as this one very much is. The project itself, as Andrew said, is located between 55th Street and 51st Street in north central Denver, along the corridor that is Washington.It's a 77 acre site which in a fully built out city like Denver, is quite a large area and we think create a great opportunity for the neighborhood and for Denver as a whole of that area. You see the county line in the slide in front of you is located along 52nd Avenue.So approximately 15 acres are in Denver and approximately 62 are in Adams County. That being said, I think it's worth noting that the neighborhood most immediately affected by this site, both historically and going forward, is the Globeville, Elyria, Swansea neighborhoods.This was a historic source of employment for them and we hope will be again in the future. Once we accommodate for roads, drainage, infrastructure, we get about 60 net developable acres. It is a contaminated site and has been for many, many years.The history of this site is one of the Asarco companies Globe plant where they've smelted metal dating back as early as 1886. On the good side of that is it created a great many jobs for a great many people for a long time.The downside of that is that the process of smelting metal contaminated the buildings, the soil and the groundwater. And it's been that case for many, many years. Our company has gone about the remediation process, and that includes the abatement and demolition of all the buildings that were out there, remediation of the groundwater that would otherwise flow asa base and into the South Platte River and then also soil remediation so that the soil itself is not a danger to health and human environment. I won't go into the details on this slide, but I've got it here.If anybody has questions later, the process for development is to take the site where we find it today or where we found it in 2011 when we started abate and demolish those buildings. That work has been done and was completed in 2012.That sets the stage for groundwater and soil remediation, which then sets the stage for grading and infrastructure. And then that middle slide, what you see is what what? Once we've been stopped, once we've graded out the site and installed the infrastructure you will have, which is basically four large super pads that can then accommodate individual commercial development. So that image on the right is one version of how this site might build out. That grading is not a small matter. There's about a 40 foot grade difference between 55th and 51st. So a lot of the exercise is one of creating flat, developable pads.The picture that you see on the right is just one example of how it might built out. But that example, there is a million square feet of new commercial development, which we think is an exciting opportunity for central Denver, north central Denver, but also its capacity to create jobs for for the residents of North Denver.In terms of timeline, like I said, we completed abatement and demolition of the buildings in 2012. Groundwater remediation was fully installed in two phases and completed by late last year. It is working, we think, extremely well. All the readings that we're getting suggest that the remedy is working and we believe that by the end of this year, the first quarter of next year, the groundwater remedy will be completely signed off on by the Colorado Department of Health and Public Environment. Soil remediation is follows. Groundwater remediation is underway now. It's an exercise of mixing the contaminated soils to stabilize them and then place them in a location where they don't come into contact with either groundwateror people. That is work that we expect to be done before the end of this year and it will then concurrent with over lot site creating or the placement of clean soil on top of the contaminated soil. What that does is that puts us in a position at the end of this year to actually begin to installsite infrastructure, stormwater pipes, sewer pipes, water pipes, roads, streetscapes, etc. Which brings me to why we're starting this process now to create the metropolitan districts to do this site entitlement, to get the sign off so that at the end of this year, when the remediation is done, we'll have all the approvals that we need to go immediatelyinto site site development and we think set the stage for vertical development as early as the second half of next year. So we think it's an exciting opportunity. The Metropolitan District is the tool that helps us finance that site infrastructure.Specifically, we think we have about $9.7 million worth of public infrastructure to install on this site, mainly consisting of streets, streetscapes, stormwater, sanitary sewer and water. The metropolitan district, we believe, has a bonding capacity of about 11.85 million, which, after fees and other costs, yields about $9.7 million worth of capacity to spend.It's worth noting that those models were run at 40 mills while the district has a capacity of 50 mills. So that extra ten mills that we don't intend to use do provide an additional $6.1 million in capacity if the infrastructure were to cost more than we anticipate the district is.The service plan includes a $25 million maximum debt issuance with a 50,000,000 million maximum. Debt service limit in terms of the mills on the site. And the other thing that we just put on here to note is that this site is also an urban renewal area with a property tax increment area, again in both Adams County andour county. So we will also have an agreement with Deer to provide for what I would call sort of the pass through of those property taxes that would go to Daera and then come back to the district so that the district can make its debt service.And then just in in in closing, I just wanted to say a broad thank you to an enormously long list of people that I won't go through. But this is a project that has been around in Denver since at least 2007, if not longer.The cooperation between Denver and Adams County has been remarkable. The work that the city agencies from Finance and Office of Economic Development that provided a grant, Adams County provided a HUD 108 loan, the Denver Urban Renewal Authority and the City Council provided a backstop for that loan to give HUD the comfort, to put it in place inthe first place. And then all of the many, many neighborhood groups and neighborhood meetings that have gone into it. And a personal thank you to Councilwoman Monteiro, who has been there every step of the way, sometimes patting us on the back and sometimes kicking us in the butt to keep this one moving forward.And it has been a real privilege to work on it. And we're excited to be at a place where we can start talking less about cleaning it up and more about building buildings. And with that, I'll sit down.I do. If you have actual questions or hard questions. Kathy and the folks from D.A. Davidson are here and we can answer those questions. Thanks.Thank you, Mr. Bergeron and Mr. Johnston for the staff report. We have three speakers signed up and all three of them can come to the front pew and speak. We have Kathy Affirmant, Zachary Bishop and Mr. Saco.Good evening, councilors. My name is Kathy Offerman. I'm here with Mike Cisneros on behalf of the applicants of the JCC metropolitan districts.I don't have any independent comments, but I'm.Available for questions. Should the Council have any?Thanks.Thank you.Zachary Bishop. Good evening. I'm Zach Bishop with D.A. Davidson and Company. We are bankers for the Metropolitan District located at 1600 Broadway and also just here available for questions.Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yes.Germans say Ku Klux Arts Movement Self-defense advocates for poor, working, poor and homeless people. Metropolitan districts. We require a lot of research and study. Especially when they're being organized and sponsored by corporations. And if you don't have strong community support in education, then what you will have happen is that a superimposed authority, quasi judicial, who can taxcommercial and private properties through the House written up. And I haven't seen the write up in terms of how this thing is going to operate, operate because you have to create a board that's going to control this thing, say.And when you get to talk about how the board is going to be appointed or elected and how the community is going to be involved in that in terms of selection of the people who are going to participate in this thing.And then it's a hidden tax because most people don't even know they're in metropolitan districts who are in metropolitan districts because most of the citizens don't either look at this stuff going on down here or is explained to them thoroughly what this is going to happen before it gets on the ballot.And then they missed it. And then it pops up in the text and they say, What is this? And then it becomes the law. Because you didn't participate, because you weren't paying attention, because you was watching a baseball game.When these kind of decisions are being made, that's going to impact you for the next 20 years. 20 years. And you don't even know these people here. You don't even know him. You haven't even been in the corporations to see what their community involvement has been historically.And you're going to pass this. You've already made up your mind to do it. I know you're going to do it. And that's okay. Because one thing I've learned from coming here for three and a half years is that I had to learn tolerance.There were things that I was going to have to accept that I hated, and yet I'd have to tolerate it because of the misinformation and education of the masses of people. They wouldn't understand what I was talking about anyway, and what he was just talking about was so garbled and mixed up with folks who had happy.Y'all don't even know what he was talking about.Mr. Speaker, you.Say with this.Mr. Speaker, thank you for your time.Support this thing just on the strength of tolerance.Until the people wake up to this. Thank you. That concludes our speakers for Council Bill five of two. Do we have any questions for members of council? Starting with council members?Yes. CAMERON Well, I'm sorry I stepped down and you may have already talked about this, but I'd love to get kind of a grander vision of what you guys hope to accomplish here on the site. You talked a little about commercial, but I don't know if some some visioning has been done.And maybe you can go into that a little bit. A little. The answer to your question is a little bit. Sorry. I'm trying to see if I can make that this image a little bit bigger. But the the site is is for a variety of reasons, got a number of restrictions that will stay in place that willprohibit residential use, agricultural use. So commercial use is the is the principal use. And we really think, given its location at the really the crossroads of I-70 and I-25, that it's a fabulous opportunity for Denver and Adams County to build new warehouse logistics distribution, flex new modern manufacturing.So I would I would really describe it as a business park. And then the site layout itself is actually dictated to some extent by that grade differential, where the Adams County site is almost 35 to 40 feet higher than the Denver County side.So the infrastructure almost starts to lay itself out. But the way I would describe it is sort of akin to Stapleton Business Center or Compaq or other large, you know, commercial business parks in the metro area. The nice thing about this one is, is it's right in central Denver where we're losing a lot of that opportunity toyears. But it's exciting to get some light in manufacturing capacity. What's the zoning on this? It's today the zoning is it's got four zoning districts because it's got two in Denver and two in Adams County. In the old code, I would sort of call it eye to.Yeah, well, on the Adams County side, there will be a pudi that'll overlay that zoning. But we're really focused on clean, modern manufacturing logistics distribution. And we think that the other thing that's nice about this site is it's got some the potential for some very large parcels where you can build some some 300,000 or larger square footbuildings, which is kind of unique for central Denver.Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Councilwoman Montero.Thank you, Mr. President. Um, I'll just I'll ask this question and then you guys can figure out who who should take it. So let's talk about the election and who's going to pay for the election. When is the election for the metro districts?And then who gets to vote?Looks like he's gonna like Councilwoman Monteiro.I'm happy to respond to those questions. Garcia from Anthem. Mickey D's for.Should the service plans be approved by both city.And county of Denver and Adams County? We're gearing up for a November 2014 election.The electors of the districts will be.Qualified by the property owner.The district is consist the district boundaries consist of only, while the service area consists of only the 77 acres, which is our commercial property.So in order to vote in an election, they will be qualified by the property owner, which at that time will be Global One LLC.Okay. So this is I just want to want to clarify that city of Denver, across the board will not be voting on these two particular metro districts. Right. How many property owners will be voting.At this point? There will be only one property owner. That would be Globeville, one LLC, we anticipate at the time of the election, and that is also the only property owner that will be subject to any taxes of the district.Okay.Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Montero. Councilwoman Ortega.Thank you. I have a couple of questions. So the first one is, can you, Cameron, tell me where the entrance to the site will be? I'm assuming that there will be access points both from Adams County and Denver, Kelly.You bet. And is it is it possible to put this back on the screen?I'm secretary of the department.Oh, it is on the screen, is it? Sorry. There you go. So I tried to make that one image just a little bit larger, if that helps, folks. So the two main entrances to this site will very likely be 52nd Avenue, which is the county line on the south.Yep. Because that will come in if. I don't know if you can see my cursor. Yeah. That will come in right in the middle of the lower what I call the lower pad because that everything to the left of this road right here, all this area is about 35 feet lower than everything up here.So this is larger. Adams County area will very likely enter off of 55th Avenue, where we expect through the pad process to install a new traffic light. So 55th Avenue will see those larger buildings on the north end and then 51st and 52nd will feed the traffic and the low and the smaller and medium sized buildings onthe south end.So do you expect the the development on the south side of 52nd Avenue to look and feel any different than the development that will be on the north side?I think it will in that the nature of the buildings are necessarily probably different right there. Those are 20 to 50, maybe 100,000 square foot buildings, whereas the buildings on the north side at least have the potential to be 150 to 300, even 500,000 square feet.So I definitely think there's an architectural difference there and a use difference. That being said, we have we are imposing a set of design standards and architectural guidelines over the entire site so that will function and feel like a single cohesive business park.So I want to ask some financial questions and I'm not sure. Maybe here you might be the right person. So help me understand the cost sharing on the administrative cost to get us to this point. And then what is any of the cost sharing look like as the revenue is being generated?I mean, you know, just looking at the map alone, you could see that you're going to have bigger buildings on the north side. Obviously, there's more land in the Adams County side. So how does that work?I think I understand the question. So by cost sharing, you mean infrastructure cost across the site relative to where then where the income is generated? Right. Got it. So to answer your first question from the cost, not only to get us here, but the cost to where we're going will be financed entirely by Global One LLC, inpart through assistance from the HUD one away alone. So we do have some financing tools that help us spend what will ultimately be more than $10 million, both to bring the site to this point, but also build all the infrastructure that you see on this on this page.The Metropolitan District, on a day in which these buildings are built and taxes are generated, we hope will be able to issue debt to reimburse those costs in the future. But they are not going to be financed by the Metropolitan District on day one.Globeville one will advance those funds and hope to be repaid.And what was the amount of the Hudson-Odoi loan?It's a maximum outstanding principal balance of $10 million.Okay. So one last question and this is about the the tax increment piece. So it's my understanding that Doura is playing that role and I see Tracy in the audience for the entire property. Correct. So does that function in the same way then in terms of cost share, all of that associated with where the taxes are beinggenerated and where they're going to be applied in terms of offsetting any of the infrastructure costs or any of those things?You would think so. So that the answer to your question is yes. The the urban renewal area covers the entire site and is sort of agnostic as to where revenues are generated and where costs are needed because we're trying to redevelop the entire site.So it is truly regional cooperation. And in that regard, I did want to be clear, though, that the purpose of of the urban renewal area in the tax increment area that has been approved so far. Was to backstop that had 108108 loan.And so as we sit here today, we, we don't actually believe that we will need to utilize tax increment to repay that loan, which is great news. Okay.So, so given that it was created as a Doura district, that typically when Doura participates in these projects, there are some administrative costs that are reimbursed back to Doura. Is that going to be handled like they're typically done with this project?So Tracy, I'm looking at you. Do you want to come forward and just elaborate on that?Good afternoon, members. Good evening, members of council. I'm Tracy Huggins. I'm the executive director of the Denver Urban Renewal Authority. The answer is yes. To the extent that there are administrative expenses incurred by Doura, it is the developer's responsibility to reimburse those costs that are incurred.Which may or may not happen.I understand there have been some costs already incurred and already reimbursed, so they are doing what they're supposed to do.Okay, great. Thank you. That answers all of my questions.Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilwoman Monteiro.Thank you, Mr. President. I have two additional questions. The the first one is, why is in viral finance not able are future developers able to build residential on the parcels in the city and county of Denver? And then the second one is maybe you can answer.It also is, can you share with my colleagues the public outreach efforts that you have gone through? Thank you.Yvette. To the to the first question, it it dates back to first and foremost, the legal answer is there's an environmental covenant that is restricts uses on the site. It was put in place by CDP. She at the time that CDP and EPA were imposing on then Asarco as the owner the cleanup standards that today we're implementingand it's fairly simple it is while we are remediating remediating the site to an end to a commercial industrial standard where it will be safe for people to work on the site and build buildings on the site and construct buildings on the site.The cleanup standards don't meet those for a residential development. It would not be you would not want children, you know, playing vegetables, growing. It really is that straightforward. And it is not a choice that Denver had. It's not a choice that Globeville one had.It was imposed by EPA and CDP. And it is it is the law of the land is where the site is regard is is regarded with regard to public outreach. It really goes back, almost to my knowledge, as early as 2007, there was a lot of public outreach both around the clean up of the site and theproperty around the site, then surrounding the creation of the urban renewal area, then surrounding the passage of the HUD 108 loan. Globeville one EFC is a company, has met at times quarterly, but always at least biannually with with the community to update them both on the status of the clean up answer questions about the trucks that weredriving in and out of the community and what was going on there. And then most recently about the development plans and the creation of this metropolitan district, we had a meeting, as you know, because you were there the as recently as last month surrounding the Pudi on the Adams County side.So we I haven't counted them up, but I'm sure it's north of 20 or 30 and I'm sure there will be that many more to come as we develop the site.And then with two months ago that the Globeville Neighborhood Planning Steering Committee, we did a bus tour. Yeah. And yelled and talked for about this is like 45 minutes about about the development there on the site.Yeah, it's it's it's a it's a it's been a long time coming. But this this neighborhood really has gotten very involved. I think that they they really do understand what caused the contamination. They understand what we're doing to to clean it up.And they're excited to be moving into the to the to the point in time at which it gets gets redeveloped and and the buildings can be built and jobs can be created.The only other thing that I just want to clarify is I just want to ask the question can can housing be built on this property?Housing cannot be built on this property.Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Monteiro. Councilmember, you said something mean. Did you want to.Oh, just going to have camera make sure that all the acronyms that he was describing.Colorado Department of.Oh, got it. Yeah. I'm sorry. So, EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, CDP, Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment. See, EPA has given its authority to CDP to oversee us as we clean the site. Housing and Urban Development, thousands of viewers.Yes. Even give that. Yeah. All right. Thank you.Gotham Councilwoman Lyman, for bringing that up. Any other questions from members of council and seen the public hearing for Final Two is closed now? Time for comments from members of Council Council Monteiro.Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you so much for your presentation this evening. As was mentioned, we've been talking about the Asarco site for four years and I then I choose to count. But in this in this particular situation, I'm very excited about the cooperative agreement and partnership between Adams County in the city of Denver.The majority of this property is in Adams County. And as I understand it, they're probably going through a similar review for their service plans around this situation. This particular project has a possibility on the Denver site. I sound so territorial and the city and county of Denver to create a possibility of between 350 and 400 jobs andon the Adams count and around 1500 to 2000 on the whole site, including Adams County, that depends on the density and the development. But also we'll focus on middle skill and middle wage jobs in this in the city of Denver.In my opinion, there's a huge need for light manufacturing in industrial locations in the city, since many of the operations have been taken up by another industry. As far as the locations in Council District nine, the industrial park areas, as was shared with me, have the lowest vacancy rates to date.And on this particular site, the facilities will be modernized industrial areas, making them even more attractive to to the Globeville area. So I wholeheartedly support advancing this forward and ask for the support of my colleagues as well. Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilman Monteiro. Councilwoman Ortega.Mr. President, I want to also express my support for this project moving forward. I think having known much of the history of this site and worked with these neighborhoods back when it was actually an operating smelter and lived through the whole process with the neighborhood and the whole CDP, you know, process of of cleaning up the neighborhoodand working with EPA and, you know, looking at the cleanup that really went beyond the Globeville neighborhood, but realizing that there's an interested party that is wanting to do this development and has taken the steps to remove the buildings which in themselves required significant cleanup.This is exciting for these neighborhoods, creating the opportunity for employment. Looking at a site that has sat there as a vacant, sort of abandoned parcel that really wasn't contributing to the community at all in creating these new opportunities for something that will look nice in the neighborhood, that will add the jobs, stimulate our economy for not onlythat area, but for the city of Denver as a whole and in the interface with our neighbors to the north. So I think overall, this is really a great opportunity for Denver, and I appreciate the role that Dora has played in sort of brokering this between the two counties to help move it forward.And I want to thank Councilwoman Monteiro for her role in working with the neighborhoods to make sure their voice was a part of the process throughout every step of the way. So with that. Thank you, Mr. President.Councilwoman Canete.Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I don't know if folks remember, but when we have the urban renewal area come through for this part of the city, during that process, one of the residents of this area said, you know, industrial, you don't need more industrial.That's how we got into this spot in this neighborhood. And I think it's such a testament to Councilwoman Montero's leadership and the outreach of EFC that we now have residents excited about the jobs, because I think we've really educated folks about the way that, you know, I always say from my mother's factory, right, that that modern manufacturingdoesn't have the same environmental impacts if it's well planned and well designed for high quality, you know, high input, low, low output kind of production. So I'm excited about the potential and I'm so pleased and so appreciative of your leadership and the level of community support that we have for this use.My one favor to ask is that since this may be our last time to see you for this project before you go out and flourish, is that please hold out for the manufacturing over the warehousing warehouse is great.It takes up huge stretches of land. It's important for getting products to market very few jobs per square foot. And so please don't jump at the first tenants if they are, you know, distribution warehouse, please hold out for some of that higher intensity employment if you can, because it would be really great to see the higher endof those estimates rather than the lower end. So if that's possible in the market, if it does, it have a real spur. If it did, it would be perfect. We have so many employers who need that, but the great transportation asset access should be an asset even without rail.So thank you very much. And I'm very enthusiastically supportive of this district tonight. Thanks.Thank you. Councilwoman Canete. See no other comments by members of Council.

Providing an honorary designation of 28th Avenue, northeast from Northeast 1/25 Street to Northeast 1/27 Street as Hayashi Avenue.Thank you, Madam Clerk. I will move to adopt Resolution 31967. Is there a second? Second, it's been moved and seconded to adopt the resolution. Councilmember Juarez, you are the sponsor of this resolution and are recognized in order to address this item.City Council president. This legislation, as you've learned, came from a resident, Hayden Bixby. Thank you, Hayden, for all your information and your public comments today regarding the house, your family that they once owned the property between 28th Avenue and 38th Avenue Northeast, where the Bank of America now stands.If you guys had a chance to look at your summary and fiscal note, they've put together some background information and I'm just going to share a few more details. This land was their home and this was also their family farm where they grew and sold produce and vegetables to the community.As you heard, they also donated decorative trees and plants to the community where there was a new school, whether there was a new school or other civic activity. Unfortunately, the house your family lost their farm when they were interned by President Roosevelt during World War Two through his executive order.After their removal, they never returned back to the neighborhood where they were once valued members. As you heard from Hayden this afternoon, she found this information and she wanted to share it and wanted to do something about it and shared it with the community that we should acknowledge and honor the family that were treated so justly byour government. So Hayden brought this history to the community, to the attention of the community, the Lake City community, and provided us with the background information about the house, your family, their land, their home and their farm, and their contributions to the greater northern north Seattle community.Therefore. And after three new leaders formed an exploratory committee to attempt to recognize the Hi Ashley family using the honorary street name program they could have done. Committee members reached out to then show an organization that is committed to preserving and honoring Japanese America's history in the region.Danielle from Dan Schorr was able to locate Bonnie, the granddaughter of the she family. Bonnie is the daughter of the last living and youngest child of the family. They received the blessing from the family to move forward and they started to reach out to the community members and organizations in the area to build support for the project. And we were happy that over 14 Lake City organizations supported the Street renaming. Another community letter leader. I'm sorry, our friend Chris Levinson. Let's build Lake City together. Begin asking for financial support from local businesses. And the committee started a go fund me to fund the installation and the manufacturing costs for the project.In just under 24 hours, as they shared this morning, they reached their fundraising goals with the generosity of over 30 individual contributions to the community we hope will be holding unveiling ceremony and the public is encouraged to join will following the public health safety protocols, of course.I've been told that the granddaughter Bonnie of the House family will be in attendance. And so I'm really happy to hear that. And Scott is working with our office and the community to find a date, to unveil the signs and honor the family at the time, as you heard me share this morning.We're hoping it might be the 25th of this month, but I'll let you know. Just as a side note, as we've talked about this for years, particularly in this council and particularly in our committee. This is just an example of how sometimes when you just recognize the past in our past wrongs and you address the truth andthe history, and you offer just a simple, humane gesture, recognizing as a family, the house, your family, and just changing the street name to really reflect the history of that place, that sense of place, that sometimes that truth and healing goes a long way.So with that I recommend council affirm confirm. I'm sorry. Resolution 31967. Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember Suarez, for bringing forward this resolution and for those comments, are there any comments on the resolution from my colleagues? Looks like there are no additional comments. I want to thank you once again, Councilmember Suarez, for shepherding this through the city council process and appreciate those who like you, those who called in to give publiccomment in support of this resolution. At this point.If I could just add. Council President, if I'm sorry, would you mind if I.No, of course, please. Last word is you.Oh, I'm sorry. You're going to do that anyway. I apologize again. You know, going through parks and going through escort. And we've certainly seen and familiar with native communities. Well, we're doing this at Linton Springs for the for the Duwamish community and other tribes.When you go to the city, I also want to thank Abigail, alcoholic, who had us take down some offensive signs that were up at Maple Leaf and up the community center. You know, just going through the city and actually being honest and renaming the places and honoring what really happened there didn't happen there.It's it is akin to just telling the truth and telling the history that we are on indigenous land and also that there are other people here that have a history that have been erased and their families and their legacies have not been marked or honored.So with that, I'm hoping if my colleagues have other places and hear from other community groups and stories that we learned and really big, thank you to Hayden for taking the time to do this and bringing this to community.I would really encourage my colleagues in your committees, in your communities to work with our office, certainly, and so we can help you shepherd through this kind of these kind of changing where we what they say. Decolonize, I guess, and rewrite and put in the right history.So we are more inclusive about everybody's place in this great city. And so I will leave it at that. Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember Suarez, for those closing remarks. I appreciate your work in this area and your constant reminder to to say the names of those that are oftentimes erased by our by our history. Okay. It looks like there are no additional comments from any of my colleagues.So at this point I will ask the clerk to please call the role on the adoption of the resolution.Whereas.I.Louis.Yeah.Morales. I must get a. Hey, Peterson.Yes.Sergeant. Yes. Strouse? Yes. Purple? Yes. President Gonzalez? Yes. Nine in favor and unopposed.Thank you, Madam Clerk.

Report from Public Works and Financial Management. Recommendation to award a contract to Waste Management for recyclable collection services in an annual amount not to exceed 3.5 million citywide.Okay. Mr. West.Mayor, council members. Over the past few weeks, there's been a huge amount of misinformation provided about the procurement process with regards to the recycling RFP, which we have attempted to correct. Each of the four firms have a financial benefit from securing this contract, so it is natural that they will be doing everything possible to secure the awardfor their company. This is a very common practice in California and throughout the nation. Recycling and trash procurement is one of the most competitive procurement processes any city can undertake. In large part due to the length of the contract period and the large costs of providing the service.Recognizing early on that the procurement process for recyclable collection services would be a high profile, sensitive one. City staff hired H, F and H, an independent consulting firm, highly regarded industry expert in refuse collection and recycling procurement. Their role was to lead us through this process from creation of the scope of work of the RFP to theevaluation of the proposals. An RFP procurement process was selected to find the best value for the city, which includes a number of criteria affecting the service, including implementation, cost, revenue to the city, potential disruption of services and service reputation.H.f. and H is an expert in compiling various proposals and comparing apples to apples. As in many cases, firms will have varying benefits or costs in their proposal. They are highly respected for their expertize transparency and independent analysis.HFA and H has served over 300 public agencies and managed over 70 competitive procurements. In fact, each of the four firms we considered has each used the H, F and H forms and bidding process in the past, and each has won under that process.In summary, city staff has taken all the necessary steps to conduct a transparent procurement process by hiring a chef and H. A highly regarded and reputable independent consulting firm. However, since questions have been raised and with the memorandum from the city auditor stating that she has concerns based on the issues discussed at the March 8th meeting, Ifeel the best approach at this point is to reject all proposals, rebid the contract and request new proposals. We need to ensure the issues raised are properly reviewed and addressed. If they prove to be factual. To respond to that request to the request of the auditor.I will be engaging in an independent. I will be engaging an independent financial firm to review the concerns and have input from both the city auditor and city attorney. The city auditor and the city attorney will have the ability for complete input into this review, and the result will be a report to the City Council on itsfindings within 30 days. There are improvements that can be made in any process. Improvements recommended by the review would be incorporated into the rebid process. The study scope would include the following a review of all written protests and comments and a review of all verbal allegations made at City Council made at City Council by vendors.A review of RFP forms as to whether they were confusing or otherwise problematic. A review of the information submitted by proposals and whether that information was properly utilized. A review of basic steps in the RFP process, including the request for additional information and including the role of the consultant use.The firm will be able to talk to anyone they wish and will get input from the auditor and the city attorney and the draft results will be reviewed by them. Finally, I do need to point out that any option other than awarding the contract to Waste Management will necessitate.We negotiate with Waste Management to provide interim recycling collection services while we perform the review and new procurement process. Their contract with the city expires in June 2016 and has to be renegotiated before it can be extended. We will engage in those negotiations immediately and return to the City Council with a recommendation.Thank you. This concludes my report. HLN is here tonight and is available to answer any questions anybody might have.Okay. Thank you. There's a there's a motion any second. I'm going to start with Councilman Richardson.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So so, first of all, thank you, Mr. West, for for this report and for keeping us up to speed on this. And thank you, City Auditor Dowd, for the memo. I did get a chance to take a look at it.And so I have seen the questions that have been raised from different parties in particular, and and now this this memo from our city auditor. So I do see what prompted this new recommendation from our city manager. As I see it and as I've been following this, it looks like there's, you know, three options that have beenplaced on the table. On the table. The first was the first staff recommendation, which is what's actually on the agenda tonight to approve this contract. Then there's the second staff recommendation, which is to conduct the third party review while running concurrently through a new bid process.And my understanding is that that still would require us to go back to the the agency that has the contract and renegotiate because their their term will expire in June. Then there was the option from the motion two weeks ago or last week that requested the 4 to 6 month audit from the city auditor.And those all seem like, you know, it doesn't seem like there's a perfect solution here. So what I'm what I'm hoping would exist is a fourth option and what that fourth option is. My first question would be how long would it take to conduct the third party review?That's actually a part of tonight's recommendation. How long would it take to conduct that review and help us determine whether there was a foul in the process? If there was a foul in the process, then fine. We push the button, go back, rebid the process, extend the contract and take those additional steps.But isn't there something isn't there a fourth option that takes less time before we, you know, so we can find out if there was a foul and use some third party. So I guess that's my first question. Is city manager, is there a way to do a shorter review, you know, 30 to 60 days, something that doesnot trigger us to go back and extend the existing contract? Is that a possibility?Councilmember My recommendation in my recommendation tonight, that is one of the recommendations that I would engage a financial consulting firm which would complete that study within 30 days.And would that avoid us from having to extend the contract because the rest of your recommendation right now is to rebid it and then we would have to extend that contract, correct?If we rebid the contract, we certainly would have to renegotiate with the current vendor.So because I think I mean, I think it's great that we do have an auditor, but we do have a city attorney and we have a number of eyes that we can place on this process. I think that what you know, it's I think asking for a 4 to 6 month audit seems like and after I findout everything that goes into this, it seems like sort of the nuclear option. And I think there's a number of steps we can take to find out if there was a foul before we go a go and commit the resources to a 4 to 6 month study.So before we make a decision on the contract, I want to know, was there a foul? So what I'd prefer to do and I'm going to make this into a motion, I'd prefer that we go forward with the first half of your recommendation, which is conduct that review within 30 to 60 days that does not trigger renegotiate, you know, renegotiating an extension and rebidding come back to the council so we can see with a third party review so we can see whether or not there was a foul, if there were if in fact, there was a foul.Then we can the city council can make that decision. So that would be my motion. I would also, as a part of that motion request, that the city attorney, city auditor, that they all play a role in this, whether it's they are part of the group that selects this third party contract, this third party evaluator, you know, if you will. But I would like that to be a part of that. Is that so? That's my motion.Okay. There is a motion and I think there's a second by Councilwoman Price. Is that right?There is. But I have a friendly a couple questions and a friendly.Okay, Councilman Price. Okay.So. I have a few questions here. First of all, I agree with Councilman Richardson's assessment. I can say unequivocally nobody that I've talked to wants to restart this process. So I think that's the one thing everybody is in agreement on is not wanting to start this process unless, of course, there's some indication that that would be aprudent course of action after some analysis, which we have no evidence to suggest that that would be the case. I think our intent, at least my intent with the agenda item last week was to just have a second, a neutral second set of eyes, take a look at the process.And while I think a longer audit would be the best course of action, I understand that we have some timing limitations and that the 4 to 6 month period presents a host of concerns. So I'm okay with this.The route that we're going, the friendly that I would make is I would like the city attorney's office, since they're a neutral, kind of not connected, they don't oversee any department that was involved in this process. I'd like the city attorney's office to select the the vendor who conducts the review.So that's the first friendly that I would make.Absolutely. I think that's that was my tent by saying involve them but I prefer the language you selected so we can have the city attorney who wasn't involved make that make that call to.Select the the the vendor that we work with. And then second, for the city attorney to kind of oversee the review process and report the findings back to me.Did you mean city? Did you mean city auditor? No.City City attorney. Attorney.Okay.Yeah.City. I think that would be that that's that's an entity that's not connected with any department that was involved in this process. And I think since we're now using not an in-house reviewer, but a contracted reviewer, I think that would make the most sense.Sure.And and then in regards to the the timing of this, I understand that we've labeled it a 30 day review. But but frankly, I think it should be the amount of time that's necessary to do the work, hopefully somewhere less than six months.But if it's 30 days or as Councilman Richardson said, 60 days, I don't think I think that if we get to June and by the way, Mr. City Manager, is there a date certain in June when the contract expires June 30th, June 30th.So if it would be possible for us to have this the findings of this review come back to council like mid-June, you know, the election's going to be kind of a busy time. So maybe the meeting after, if we could have them come back, that'll give us time to determine whether or not we're going to be movingforward with staff's recommendation or we need to. Go further. So I would recommend June 14th. That comes back by the city attorney with recommendations.Or no later than.No later than.Yeah.And I would accept that and let me clean it up then since initially I said, you know, who could be involved as a city attorney, city auditor, I think since given these friendlies, I think we should just keep it clean and just say the city attorney.That's fine.Period.Perfect. Okay. We're going to keep moving forward here. Councilman Price, did you have any additional comments or, you.Know.OC suggested I'm going to restate this just to be very clear. What we're essentially taking the recommendation to re rebid and restart the process the same time. That I missed that first part.So that's the part we're not doing. So what we're doing is just restate. We're going to conduct the review that takes, you know, sometime between 30 and 60 days, as long as it does not trigger the contract extension.We're going to do the review. Based on that review, the council will decide either to award the contract as recommended or we begin the process again. Got it.Okay. Thank you. That's actually completely different than what I heard.With with the city attorney.Conducting. And the and the person conducting the review is the city attorney.No. They select.Selection, selecting the third.Party to provide oversight to the process.Perfect. Okay.And, Mayor, if I may, I.The what I heard from.The city manager is the scope of the services. I want to make sure what I'm signing up for here. So the.It would be to.Come back to the were in working with the independent financial firm within 30 days before June 14th to.And I'm just going to read it's.A review of all the written protests, the comments, a review of all the verbal allegations that were made at the council meeting, a review of the forms, and then a review of the information submitted by the proposers and whether the information was properly utilized and considered.And then the basic steps in the RFP process, including the request for additional information in the context and the roles of our consultant, and that this firm would would be talking to anyone and everyone in the city that they needed to in order to get that information.At that point, they will come back with some sort of a an opinion on the process and what happened. And if I understand Councilmember Richardson correctly, at that point, council can make a decision to either reject all bids if there were problems.Or if they believe that the.Process was fair. You can make your determination on who to award to.Okay. Thank you.And Councilman Price, I do I do have some clarification on that scope. But since I seconded the motion, one thing that wasn't included in the scope that the city manager specified, although I think it is included in the broader umbrella but wasn't spelled out and I think it should be spelled out is I've met with three ofthe four vendors and every single one of them has pointed to some numeric equation or numeric value that was reported that in their opinion. That to me raised some concerns about what actually was and put it and if everybody was on the same page about the numeric value.So I think the scope should involve, you know, again, this is this is not our industry. So that's why we're hiring someone to help us with it. But the replacement of the containers and the value of the recyclables, whatever criteria was factored into the equation, because when we're speaking with these vendors and they're telling us this numberwas an accurate or this, that's really not something that council members should be interpreting, in my opinion. So if they can look at the numbers, the data that went into the calculations and make sure that everybody was operating from the same understanding, I think that would be that would give me a lot of confidence in this process. Q Councilmember Oranga.Thank you, Mayor. Basically, as I said last week, I wasn't approving the direction that the City Council was giving the city attorney or the city order in this. I still feel that the process took care of itself and with that in mind, like to ask staff if they could go over the process again from beginning to endand how long did it take and how much staff time was involved in getting these bids evaluated and to the point of last week where we a recommendation was made.Councilman to restate the question.Describe the process from beginning to end as to how we got to the point of last week where you made your recommendation to go with waste management.Our public works director, Craig Beck. I think you might want to introduce our consultant.By the way, as a consultant here.So. So, Craig, could you introduce our consultant?Yes. You're mayor members of council tonight. We have a representative.From that who who worked directly with staff in the preparation of this RFP and who analyzed the responses and who has done this a number of times. And I'll ask him to generally walk through the process and. Provide some more information about how the groups were put together and analyze.Good evening. Mayor and council members. The City of Long Beach released an RFP to the city's purchasing division on April 21st, 2015. Pre proposal meeting was subsequently held on May 11th, offering all the proposals proposers an opportunity to ask questions.Written responses to those questions from the pre proposal meeting were issued on May 13th. 2015. And then after the pre proposal meeting, written questions were subsequently accepted until May 22nd, 2015, and then written responses to those questions were provided by the city on June 10th, 2016.The proposals were due on July one, 2015. A written proposal summary that was prepared by our office, dated August five, 2015, was sent out by the city to each proposer to confirm our understanding of their proposals, and that included the proposed first year compensation.Responses to that communication were submitted by August 12th, 2015.Could you stop right there for a second?Yes.This backtrack a little bit. Who are you? How long have you been in business? What's your track record in doing these kinds of auto proposal reviews for not only the city of Long Beach, but for other jurisdictions as well?Build up. Build up.Tell me you're credible.Tell me who you are. We're very credible. And we have done more of this work in the state of California than any other firm that's out there. We were founded in 1989. I joined the company in 1991. And since that time, this is all I do is solid waste work.I don't do roads one day and transportation the next day. All I do 52 weeks a year is solid waste and recycling work. I've personally been involved in approximately 30 of the competitive processes that we've taken cities through and have negotiated many, many more contracts than that.We don't work for any of the trash companies. We only provide these services to public agencies to avoid any sort of conflict of interest that would occur if you were to work for garbage company on Monday in the city on Tuesday.I think that would be a problem. So after the responses were received to our summary of proposals that completed the preliminary evaluation and then additional cost information was requested from the proposers under a fixed ten year term, the initial seven year term included a three year option to the city to extend.So to get a better price, the city package the three year option with a seven year fixed term and said what would that do to your price for ten year? And the companies responded in writing, providing that ten year cost information.The last step in the process was all four proposers were interviewed by the city's evaluation team. Then we prepared an evaluation report, provided information that the city staff and city staff prepared the documents that you've that you've seen after the preliminary staff reporter draft staff report was prepared or not, a draft eight staff report was prepared.Public indicated that there they believe their costs were less than what was shown in the report. Essentially, Republic didn't complete its proposal form correctly. They made a mistake. They're human. People make mistakes. They were provided an opportunity to correct that mistake and information that was provided subsequently to the council.And so you've seen their numbers go both ways. The bottom line is, even if you take their corrected figure, it is still higher than that of Ed Coleman Waste Management, and it is higher than that of the current rates.This is a request for proposal, not a request for bid. So you can still you don't have to throw their proposal out, which you would do in a bid process. You could still accept it if you choose to.You can accept any one of the four proposals that are before you. But their proposal is not as cost effective as the ones from waste management that go.Is that complete?Yes.Okay. In terms of a staff time, a city manager, how much staff time was put in on this report from beginning to end, from May to last week or two weeks ago?From the last two weeks.Up to that point from eight to the.Oh, the entire RFP process. Boy, I'm going to turn that over to our public works director or perhaps Jason McDonnell, our purchasing officer who did the RFP.Councilmember. We would estimate that there were hundreds of hours involved in the analysis as well as the RFP preparation.Now going back to the process itself and at the point where one of the three agencies submitted, I'm assuming that they submitted a complaint. That the process was somewhere flat. Was that was that a process in itself also to revisit or review the contentions that were being made by this other this other agency?And what was that? What did that include?Council member the process to review a bid protest or in this case, an RFP proposal protest is stated within the specifications and allows certain timelines. The responses were acknowledged and based on the complexity of this process, there was additional time requested by the city to respond to both a letter of concern from Echo and a specifically calledout protest by Republic. So there was additional work done at that time to review and consult both with the consultant as well as city staff in the Environmental Services Bureau.So the consultant was also a part of the protest review period.Yes, sir.Okay. So in essence, what is being moved in front of me by Councilmember Richardson is to add is to and he and this is a statement I think that he made was. He wants to know if there was no foul foul in stat's review of the complaint.Now. From what I understand up to this point, there was an RPG put out. People applied, they were reviewed, a recommendation was made, a protest was filed, the protest was reviewed. And the staff came with a recommendation. Yeah, correct.Yes, sir. To summarize it very briefly. Okay. So at this point, I want to thank you, obviously, for your remarks, but there is nothing that I've seen at this point to indicate that anything went a fall. That there is a misinterpretation of figures that there has been any kind of malfeasance, as it was mentioned before.I think that having the third party review with H.f. and each was was fair. It's a third party review. It is a consultant and city manager or maybe city attorney. If you were to go to a third party review, who would you hire if not H.f. and H?Who is there somebody out there?I certainly don't have a name as I sit here today. We would have to go find someone and I would get names of folks who have to do this kind of work.Yeah.So and that's and that's my contention. I think that what we did was we did the best we possibly could. We had the best of the best involved in this. And so I want to make the substitute motion to go back to the original motion, which is to accept staff's recommendation for the the proposal that's presented.There's emotion. I don't see a second there. A second? There is a second. Okay. By Councilmember Austin, which is the original motion. Councilman Austin, do you want to speak to the second?Yes. This is and I want to thank all of the bidders for for their interest in serving the city of Long Beach. I want to thank staff for their exhaustive work on this. I want to thank the council members for for weighing in.But I tend to agree that we are we may be duplicating our efforts. Again, it seems to me that there has been a third party independent review and a third party governing this this this process. The outcomes are not necessarily what everybody necessarily wants, but it seems to me that.Our actions could be perceived as disruptive. It would disruptive to two services. If we don't, we don't make a decision soon. And and so I'm very concerned about that. I'm concerned about our ability to to continue to actually get recycle or have recycle services.I don't want interruption. It's clear that for the past 20 plus years, we've had pretty decent service. I haven't heard too much of in terms of disappointment with the services that we we currently have here today. I've looked at the YouTube videos.I've reviewed a number of the the the claims and understanding that this is a very, very competitive process. I think council member Urunga is assessment is is is is actually pretty spot on here. And so therefore I'm seconding the motion and recommending that that the rest of the council follow suit.Okay. Thank you. Now, just before I continue, I want to make sure we can get to the public as well. If unless I know we're going back through another round of folks that have of councilmembers are unless there's objection, I'd like to go to the public and they will come back to the speaker's lists unless there's objection. Okay. Councilman, you really want to clarify something about your motion? Yeah.I want to recommend. I want to make clear that my motion is to receive and file the city manager's report and to accept the original proposal from city management to award the contract as proposed to waste management. Okay.That's the that is the substitute motion on the floor. We're going to go to any public comment and it will come back to the speaker's list of the council without objection, seeing none. Okay, great. Any public comment on this item?Okay. So there is no public comment on this item. So I'm going to go and go back to the council. There is no there is. Okay. We got to make up our minds if there's public comment or not.Please, guys, if there is. Let's do that now.Good evening, Honorable Mayor Garcia and members of the council, the city of Long Beach. My name is Jeff Snow and I am with Republic Services and Rainbow Environmental Services of Huntington Beach. I am wearing a purple tie tonight because to me, this contract is still about recycling.Recycling and sustainability in the city of Long Beach. And I'd like to share some recycling performance data at the mayors and councils. Pleasure Based on the March 9th City Council meeting. Staff presented the 26,749 tons were recycled for the city of Long Beach in the prior year, just down the road using advanced murf or material recovery facilitytechnologies using a workforce with the tenure of ten years on average where they're paid well, provided full benefits and workforce development opportunities, and with outreach to residents that increases their participation and set out rate. Based upon the actual performance validated by the state of California.Cal Recycle for the city of Huntington Beach. The same Long Beach results would have been nearly 50,000 tons recycled instead of 26,000 through Republic Services Program and Rainbows Material Recovery Facility. We do think that recycling and diversion is important to the citizens of the city of Long Beach, and we urge council and staff to evaluate the actualrecycling performances of the Smurfs. Again, we invite all to come and visit our facilities, see what our processes, what our outreach, and what our programs can do to enrich this community's sustainability. Diversion and commitment to the planet. Thank you.Next week, please.Good night. We are.I'm representing the drivers of the company that pick up your recycling problem, which we've been doing for 20 years, over 20 years. Whether we're right, whether it's clean and we want to keep on doing it. We went through.All this process I think is long enough. We will need to go to extension or anything. We just want to keep on doing what we're doing well. And we've been doing it for so long. Just please ask you, we ask you to consider it right now and get it over with.Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Good evening, Mayor. Council, city staff and guests. My name's Jeremy Harris, senior vice president at Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce. Tonight, I'm here on behalf of our Chamber and Long Beach area businesses. We're here due to the recent comments made in the press and the various correspondences that have been made public regarding the proposal process forthe city recycling collection services that we're discussing tonight. We welcome the opportunity for an independent third party. Review has been discussed tonight. We believe this is a permanent move. The Chamber is not only concerned with this particular process or this particular bid or RFP, but the entire bidding and process long term.Time and time again, members and non have contacted the Chamber regarding the city's RFP and bid process. Each time we've ensured these businesses that we believe staff is provided the utmost care and due diligence to the process. In fact, we've openly promoted the city's bid proposal process through multiple media channels to our members and interested businesses.So that is why we are here tonight, to ensure that when the process is further put under the microscope, which has been made apparent with this particular bid, that we take notice with these concerns so that we may appropriately educate our members about the process through the city.It is with this understanding that we ask for an independent and thorough review of the process. We find it prudent and unbiased that if a third party comes in and does this, it is the best way to move this process.This item with the city recycling contract and services forward and ensure our business is of a fair process moving forward in the future. Thank you for your opportunity to address you tonight.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Thank you, Mayor and City Council. My name is no Legado Mondo. I'm actually the executive director of Long Beach Blast, a nonprofit here in Long Beach. Been around since 2000. And we are committed to this city and to the youth and to education.And I must say, although I'm not here to talk about the bid process or the RFP, I do want to talk about waste management and their commitment to the city and to the youth of our community, because they not only are here obviously bidding this contract and wanting to serve the public, but also want to serve ouryouth. They support us, which supports the community of Long Beach, not only financially but also with their time. One of our board members is from Waste Management, Janine Hamner. She's here. And again, as somebody who cares about Long Beach, and even though this might be all about dollars and cents, we have to think about who is committed, who is putting their money and their time and their effort to our community. And that's waste management. Thank you.Thank you. See no other public comment. I'm going to go to close public comment and go back to the council and then we're going to go to vote. Councilman Mongo.Since we have the consultant here, I thought I might ask just a few quick questions of things that had been posed to me via email of my constituents over the last two weeks while we've had this time. They had asked whether or not the time our RFP process took is significantly similar to other agencies of our size. Would the consultant be able to speak to that?Yes. Similar.And. Would you say that what an average cost would be of putting together an RFP of this magnitude for a have you have you worked on an RFP of a similar city? And did it cost plus or -10% of what this bid cost?Yeah. We've been involved in processes that have run from 100, $250,000 for the whole process start to finish.And this one cost.I think this is right about 100.And so if we're a significant city of great size, we were on the lower end of that. Is there any contributing factors to why that was?It's only a recycling contract. Most of the cities have integrated trash, recycling organics programs, all the residential, all the commercial, all the roll off. And they're actually by dollar value, far larger than this one here at Long Beach for much smaller cities, because this is only the recycling piece, which is a very the smallest piece of thesolid waste stream in the city of Long Beach. Municipal crews provide the residential refuse collection, which is a much larger activity than the recycling. And the commercial is provided by multiple commercial haulers that compete on for business rate at the individual account level.So we're talking about a very small portion of the entire solid waste stream here in Long Beach.And typically does your firm prepare the report or do the city staffs of each city that you do the research for typically perform those reports?We typically develop the evaluation report and then the the city staff develop a staff report with their recommendation to council.So that's significantly similar to what happened in this last round as well.That's correct.Do they typically have up to four adjustments in discussions after the interview phase asking for different variances.There's not a standard there. Every city's done things differently if they've. So I think it's important to understand that what the was was trying to be achieved here is to allow everybody the opportunity to propose on the same thing.And as an example, when the initial proposals came back, they were for seven year terms and with all the carts being replaced and one of the vendors proposed, well, if we don't replace all the cards in EUR four, we can provide a more cost effective proposal.And they gave an alternative cost. And so to ensure we had apples to apples, we went back and asked all the other vendors. We said, well, if you were to do that, what would that do to your costs, too?So, you know, the situation was tailored to the circumstances that you had so that the council wouldn't be placed in a situation where you had one company that provided a proposal under one set of circumstances and another company saying, well, here's this alternative proposal, and it's much better when the other companies haven't had an opportunity to proposeon it. Mm.And the last major question that I received via email was about understanding the commodity of recycling and how. The prices change and how a vendor would even be able to predict what recycling revenue to the city might be and what that does to a bid.Recycling commodity revenues are an important part of what the vendor is going to get back to offset portion of their costs of operation, as well as what they'll remit in revenue sharing to the city. Trying to predict commodity markets is like trying to predict what the stock market is going to do each year for the next tenyears. It's a nearly impossible exercise. That being said, the vendors do the best they can, but they may make very different assumptions about what those commodity markets are going to look like. So it wouldn't make any sense for the city in evaluating the proposals to put as an offset to their cost evaluation what different proposers are projectingin the commodities markets, because they all make very, very different assumptions and in the end they're all selling to the same commodity market. They may make and use the stock market example again. They all may make very different predictions about what that market's going to look like, but in the end, they're all going to participate in thesame market.And so with that flexibility and commodity, as you can tell, many of my residents are very read up on the issue, some of which used to be city staff. Is there a reason that we don't standardize the revenue requirement of recyclable contracts?And is that we Stan standard across all bids across many cities in the region? They are not standardized, is that correct?Well, most cities don't have a separate recycling contract. It's a small piece of a much larger contract. And the and the recycling pieces is very modest. And so that's not the focus when you're looking at a trash contract.Thank you. I appreciate you being here tonight. I appreciate you standing by your work. I appreciate the work that the city staff have done, and I look forward to hearing the comments of my colleagues.Councilman Price.Thank you. I already spoke. So I'm going to be very brief. I just want to say, I heard what Councilman Urunga and Councilman Austin said, and you were going to have to agree to disagree on their points. I think in light of what the city auditor has pointed out, we're talking about we were talking about a sixmonth review process. I think Councilman Richardson. Was very thoughtful in his desire to compromise for something shorter that allows a review, while at the same time allowing the process to move forward. You know, it's it's this this whole losing side of the forest for the trees argument.We're talking about a short window of time to be able to say that we did everything that we could to ensure that the process was fair. This is not at all about the companies. Let me just start by saying all three of these companies are stellar companies.There's no doubt about it. None whatsoever. I've met with all three companies. I've met with their representatives. The City of Long Beach would be well-served to have any one of these three companies representing it. And Waste Management has absolutely done an amazing, outstanding job over the last 20 plus years, no doubt about it whatsoever.But that's not what we're here to do. We've gone out to to bid. We've opened up the process. We haven't opened up this process for decades. And every single one of the vendors has pointed out something that warrants some additional consideration.And we're not talking about an extensive process. We're talking about 30 to 60 days to make sure that we feel confident in the process before we vote to move forward on a ten year partnership. I met today. I've met with all the representatives and again, I have nothing but positive things to say about all of them.But I do have to highlight I met with Ed Co today and I just I want to say every single one of these companies has been a class act. But I was taken aback by Ed Coe's. Just there, there, there demeanor during the interview.I mean, they had nothing but amazing, positive things to say about the people that are competing for this proposal. Amazingly positive attitude towards the city of Long Beach, towards wanting to do work in the city of Long Beach.You know, they have some issues with some of the calculations, but certainly it's not something that they're going to protest. That's just not how they do things. As as they explained to me, whether you choose to follow their philosophy or not.That's just an example to me of what good quality companies we're dealing with here. That in a meeting with me tonight before this item, they had nothing but positive things to say about the people that are bidding against them on this project.And really, their their ask was, we think a second set of eyes would be prudent. There are some things that they would have, you know, like to see included or not included that they feel were a big factor in the final price recommendations that came down.And that is the same with Republic and even Waste Management and talking with them. I've learned that there are there are probably had they not been the recommended bids, some issues that they would have had with the numbers.So this really isn't about every single one of these companies is great partner. This is just about taking the additional 30 to 60 days with Shorten that process, we've taken the full official audit out of it and said, You know what, let's have an entity that's not affiliated with this process.Select someone to help us take a look. We lose nothing by doing this. We lose nothing. No, there's no credible argument that anyone can make that says we lose anything. Even waste management that I've spoken with their representatives, they understand why we're doing this.They understand that we've made efforts to shorten this process. And I think they're willing to be a ten year partner with the city. An additional 30 to 60 days is not too much to ask in terms of an investment.I think everyone that we're working with is patient enough to understand that process. Again, we want to be if if the staff recommendation is what the reviewing body says, you know what this was all the numbers are accurate.Everything was reported accurately. The process was great. We can vote on that. No problem. I have no problem voting on that. I just don't want to vote on that, especially knowing what I know now in terms of some of the things that have been pointed out, I don't want to do that until I personally have a secondset of eyes, take a look at it. And my understanding is that the consultant that we hired wasn't here to give it a second set of eyes. They actually were the consultant that was hired to do the process.They weren't brought in to review the process. They were the company that helped us do the initial process. So it's not we haven't had a review of the process. So I think I thank my colleagues for listening.Councilman Richardson.Thank you. I'm going to clarify the intent here, and I'm going to appeal to my colleagues to try to find some consensus here, because the intent was this was a compromising consensus building motion. So so I do want to thank all of the companies that submitted.I'm pretty confident that most of them, if not all of them, probably would have done a great job. And that's why I don't think we should immediately throw out the baby with the bathwater. I understand the diligence that did go into this process.What I'm looking at seeking is clarity and confidence in casting. No doubt on the process we can get to a yes or no. And you know, the I read the auditor the memo from the auditor. The city manager acknowledged it and changed his recommendation.I can't reconcile that by going back to the original recommendation. I count on the city manager, our city attorney, our city auditor to provide good advice. And I'm looking at a change in position because it's okay to take a moment, take a pause in, you know, and review the process.That's okay. My motion is to substantiate whether or not there's an issue and, you know, and save money while we do it. That's what I consider a hybrid or a compromise. It should provide more confidence to this process.It saves money from a 4 to 6 month process. That would also include an extension of a contract. But it preserves the integrity of the the original bids by just reviewing whether that process was legitimate or not. I.I would rather verify or dispel doubt and convert that doubt into certainty of yes or no. And that's the intent of this motion. So that said, given that I don't have a dog in this fight, I think that most of these companies will probably do great.I'm going to appeal to the to the SEC, to the substitute motion maker and the second tier that said, you know, I understand where you're coming from in terms of, you know, wanting to not take any additional precedent in this process.But do you do you have any issue with taking a moment? We're talking 30 to 60 days so that the entire the entire council can feel as confident as the two of you do. And that's really what the question is.I don't I don't think we should go into a split vote. All of our interest is doing the right thing here. So I'd like to have a response from if we could.Well, actually well, I'd actually counsel my rank of next. And so counseling for your anger.Are you done? I mean, if I respond, do you see what I'm done?I just wanted to ask you.To roll with it. I'm just getting clarification. Brother is getting clarification. Okay. The the the intent of my motion. The intent of my motion. You know, I certainly agree with all the comments have been made thus far that the three agencies have all three being class acts.I mean, I've met with all three of them as well. They were very cordial, friendly, open, obviously concerned about about the whole process, but they were professional and competent. And there was no question that either one, any one of them could do an outstanding job for the city.But. My issue, if anything, is that there was a selection made. There was a process. They competed. They turned them in. There was a protest. The protest was reviewed and the recommendation came forward. That's where our man is that there was a process.And anything going beyond what the recommendation already is, is a spent is a is an expenditure. We're investing more time. We're investing more money. We're investing more staff to continue the process, even if it's for a month. To revisit this whole this whole process here.I have a question also for the for the firm H.f. and h have you ever encountered anything like this before where you're being you're being asked to step aside and have a third party review of a contract or a recommendation that you've already done before this happened?No, we've never seen a third party review.Okay. So it's it's precedent setting in this case. And, you know, I'm not sure that we want to go that route, but I leave it up to my counsel colleagues in that respect. And in terms of staff. I'm sorry I lost my money.I didn't lose anything. I just can't read my own writing. Okay. Well, that would be that would be basically my, my, my, my comments there is that. My issue with this and the reason for my motion is that the process was a process.Staff invested a lot of time. Thousands of hours in this hole, in this whole issue. And staff came back with a recommendation. My my whole point in this is not whether we want to find or go on a witch hunt to find something wrong.There was a protest filed. And basically what this country is going to do is say that that the protest has validity. Even though staff found no validity. But in the end and the council. Those who are supporting the the well.Let me rephrase it that the the the proposal, the original one is that to go through an audit that's out of the window now. So I guess I found my comment. So in this now not that it's it's it's changed the game to a certain to a certain extent city manager now that the the the city auditorhas been taken out of the equation. Where where does that put you now in terms of your recommendation with with the report, the staff report that you filed today?Councilmember regarding the study by an independent third party firm. I'm standing firm with that given the auditor's memorandum, so I have to respect that.Okay. So you're you you you stand by the actual because you already you've been you been requested or asked to. Have a third party review, whether it's a moderator or not.No, Councilmember, I've not been. No one's asked me that question. Given the memo that the auditors sent, I felt that the best way to deal with that would be to have an independent review. I'm certainly okay going off the for 30 or 60 days before without rejecting the bids.But certainly I think I have to stand with the independent review because I do have to respect the auditors memorandum, though. That's very serious. Okay.Well, I'm going to stand by my my my motion only because I think that staff invested a lot of time, a lot of money, a lot of, I guess, blood, sweat and tears in getting this whole contract go to the city council and in a timely manner, starting from last May to two weeks ago.So I no Councilmember Richardson. I will not I will stay I'll stay by way of initial motion.Vice Mayor Lowenthal.Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and I appreciate the conversation. And I know that Councilmember Yarrawonga spoke very emphatically during the last time we took this item up, and and I have a lot of respect for his position. I come from a couple of decades worth of history with our peace and bid processes.And the last thing we want to do is really waste anyone's time or waste anyone's resources. And the government procurement process is is a lengthy one. It's it's not expedient and sometimes it's not efficient, but we do the best that we can.And our standard, to be sure that we did the ultimate best is is a high one. And so taking a little bit more time, as much as. As much as I begrudge that it does in the end, allow us the confidence to make the decisions that we do.With this particular situation, I and I want to concur with Councilwoman Price. Every person representing a company that spoke to me and my office regarding this issue had only the best things to say about their competitors, which is unique.It's hard to find that in in a competitive industry. And I want to thank all of you for taking that approach. No one disparage the other regardless of where they came in the ranking, but all spoke to the integrity of the process and laid out their case, which is their job.That is what they're supposed to do. Our job is to feel absolutely confident in the recommendations that we're making or that we're voting on. And I feel and I believe and I think that with this particular recommendation, I'm not as confident as I'd like to be to make that decision.And so I appreciate Auditor Dowd's report. I appreciate that our staff took a look at it and came forward with a recommendation. What I'd like to support and ask that we all support is a 30 day review, as the original motion indicates of of the process, and then come back and see what our recommendation is at thattime. So with that, colleagues, I recommend that we go back to the original motion. I do respect Councilmember Yarrawonga and and Councilmember Austin's position. It is a correct one in in on the face of it, because it is time, it is resources.And you feel strongly and I agree with Councilman Richardson, I'd like to feel that strongly with my vote. Thank you.Councilman Austin and then Councilman Gonzales. And we're going to a vote.Thank you. And they say we always agree up here. I don't think that's the case. And I do appreciate the comments from my colleagues. Everybody is making reasoned comments here this evening. My my my concern has been been obviously the process and and, you know, just entertaining that you know, there has been something wrong with the processwhen. But in our city auditor's memo was certainly eye opening. I'm curious this evening hearing the original motion, why the city auditor was removed from the process? No, because it states that it's going to go right through to the city attorney only.And so she she raised so many pointed points during her entire memo. The original motion has has actually sought to to eliminate her. And so this is this is this is not a mea culpa or anything like that.I do think that it is important that we we move forward in award of contract. I think it is. We're running out of time. We are going to bring an issue back and then literally have two weeks to to make a decision.And and and even possibly if we decide to kick the can down the road a little bit further, renegotiate with with with a two week window. I think we are really putting a lot of strain and have put a lot of strain on our on our city staff on this particular RFP.And and as a council, I think it is our job to try to inspire confidence for them as well. This is and I'm really concerned about about setting a precedence here because, you know, we reward or award our fees and contracts week after week after week here.Now, none of them have been this contentious and none of them have literally been dragged through the mud the way this one has has been and dragged through. And so as as polite as each and every one of the respondents to our RFP have been, and they have all been been great to work with.I think they all continue to be stakeholders in our city in one way or another doing different type of services. The the the process I will say I am I'm a bit disappointed in how. The, um, this this is this is kind of played out.And again, I'm concerned about really setting up a setting a messy precedence here. But that's it. I mean, I'm it sounds like the votes are here. And and, you know, if we all stand with the council member, you wrong on this motion if it this motion fails, then, you know, we will deal with the original motion.I want to thank my colleague, Councilman Richardson, for for looking for that compromise. And and again, I think, you know, we are we are prolonging the inevitable. But if it requires us to spend more resources, to spend more time to make sure that that everybody is competent, then then that's that's something that we can do as well. And I will be be supportive of doing that. But honestly, I'd like to go with the original motion. And again, I have to to question the city manager here because your point is well taken. You came forth with a work or make a recommendation a week ago and and or two weeks ago and now because of theauditor's report, which was based on what was heard here at city council, mostly because and that's what I read it was based on what was raised at council and public comment and from colleague and from council members. She raised concerns.Um, and I don't know if that was necessarily based on raw data or, or any, any real review of the process and so forth. For you, Mr.. City Manager, your recommendation is something that we have to weigh very seriously.Um, why specifically the turnaround again.COUNCILMEMBER I'll repeat what I mentioned to Councilmember Turanga. The I, the city auditor prepared a memo that raised issues and questions. And I believe in our city auditor. I'm taking that very, very seriously. And given what was in that memo, I think we should definitely go back and do the 30, 30 day look see with an independentfirm. And I truly believe that. And um, we have a memo from our auditor stating concern and we have to respect that.Okay. So with that, I'm going to withdraw my second from this motion. I will. And I'm going to give deference to our city manager, because I think we need to to read those signals and read those cues. But I certainly hope I certainly hope, Mr. City Manager, that when this comes back, that that if there is anysort of malfeasance found in here in this process, that people are held extremely accountable for that.Okay. Councilman Gonzales. And are going to a vote.Right. I think everything has been said, as you know, to what I wanted to say. But, you know, I think with such a large contract, you know, there's questions that naturally raise. And I don't think that any of us have questions that are out of the norm.I think many cities go through something similar like this. And so with that, I mean, you know, we're looking at the auditor's report. There's been questions raised as to that. I think the city manager did a great job in terms of kind of stepping back and realizing that this council really needed to take an extra look atthis despite everything. And I don't I don't negatively look at our city process and think that it was done in any way, shape or form, in a malicious way or anything was less than high integrity at all. I just think that this is a large contract and we need to make sure that we're doing things in away that this council I think feels is most necessary, is just taking an extra review. And I think I hope it goes to the former of 30 days versus the latter, but we'll see. And that would be my my support.I would certainly support doing an independent review. So we'll.Official.We'll go from there. Thank you.Thank you. Councilmember Ringo.Just to make it official, I will withdraw my motion.Okay, great. And I'm just one thing I think that needs to be said after this conversation. I just want to repeat that. No one up here. This is a process has gone through. There's been a had an independent person go through the process that's kind of well-respected in the industry.Staff has worked very hard. I want to thank staff for working hard on this. They have been working very hard to respond to all the questions and the inappropriate questions from the council as part of their deliberative process.So I just want I want to thank them for that, but I just also want to want to clear up and make sure that we're pretty clear that no one is accusing anyone or has accused anyone of doing anything inappropriate.What has happened is questions have been raised that people have the confidence to move forward and make sure that this big contract is being awarded in the right way. And there's nothing wrong with taking another. We're taking a look, which is what I think the council is is saying.And so there's a motion on the floor. Castro votes.Motion carries.\nSummary:", "answer": "Recommendation to adopt Specifications No. RFP PW 15-091 and award a contract to USA Waste of California, dba Waste Management, of Long Beach, for recyclable collection services, in an annual amount not to exceed $3,500,000, plus an annual Consumer Price Index adjustment; and authorize City Manager, or designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into the agreement for the term of July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2026 (ten years), including any necessary amendments thereto regarding the term and/or scope of services.

Councilman, our Councilman Allen do have any remarks.A Yes. Thank you, Mayor. I just want to real quickly and briefly, I just want to thank the man with 2/1 names, Director Brant Dennis, for his just for his partnership in this mobile basketball program. And, you know, these outdoor activities for kids are super important to me.And it brings me so much joy when I see the kids and the parents all at the one two year old beach, you know, shooting the hoops. And I go down there and I check that out over the weekends.And I love seeing just people waiting. Sitting on the ball are just waiting for a pickup game. And I love bringing my nephews down there. But one of the things that we were missing, there's just not enough of them.So I think that these hoops will be, you know, just real important for they you know, they can go on in and play with each other and just give them things to do. Plus, I want to say that the portable hips will be beneficial for years to come and it will add, you know, major flexibility to ourrecreation staff to deploy them around the the second district. So my staff did tour at different areas and the potential sites for these kids who will be possibly at Pierpoint Landing Promenade Square Park in Bixby Park. So just want to thank Brant enough and I can't wait to get this set up.And. And Brant, we're going to do a pickup game together. Thank you so much.That's right.

Councilman, new.Thank you, Mr. President. I was also concerned about the retention issue, the 82 or so employees who would be losing their jobs as these restaurants turned over. So we had a good conversation. I learned I was very impressed with the process they went through, and I was reassured that the number of vacancies they inherited is several hundredvacancies, and they feel very confident that they can fit these 82 employees into positions that day. So I felt very good about what they were going to do. They committed to me that they would actually make sure that those people had those opportunities for employment.So I feel very good about their commitment as well as the process, and I'll be supporting this tonight and I encourage my colleagues to do as well. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman. New Councilwoman Gilmore.Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to speak on this since Dan is in my district, in District 11 and working very closely with the airport personnel, understanding a little bit around the RFP process and how important it is that staff is involved, but that there's also an opportunity for content experts from different areas that that wouldinform the, you know, validity and the strength of an RFP and really knowing that that that panel worked very hard and that, you know, we're talking about millions of dollars on both sides. I understand folks not being totally happy.But then on the other side, knowing that there was a separate panel that evaluated these proposals and that the legal team at Dan made sure that they vetted them appropriately. My my only one. Recommendation would be that, you know, that there's some language on the RFP that really addresses what happens to these proposals, you know, going forwardso that the folks that don't get the bid understand the parameters in which they're, you know, working on and that, you know, really kind of going outside of that process makes it much more difficult because we end up asking questions in committee that we weren't privy to the entire process and the whole behind the scenes.And so and there's no way for us necessarily to be part of that, nor should we, where our duties are not in contracting. And so understanding that from both sides. But I do want to congratulate all of the parties involved in making sure that those 82 employees have the opportunity for a new employment transition.Those stories rang very true with me, and I just have to commend folks on both sides doing the hard work to make sure that that happens for those employees, because at the end of the day, the employees at Dan make than what it really is.And so just wanted to congratulate you all on that. Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilwoman Gilmore. Councilman Lopez.Thank you, Mr. President. I, too, had a little bit of reservation about some of the process. And I think part of it is, is indeed that. And I think councilman, councilman, Councilwoman Gilmore is is dead on when we talk about language, understanding the RFP process and making sure that that that's understood from the get go.I do share the the. Just the peace of mind and being able to sleep at night, knowing that those workers, those employees have retained their jobs. And the only thing they will change is the shirt, the uniform. Right.But they can go home knowing that they have a paycheck. They can go home knowing that they don't have to look for another cheaper place to live, which probably won't be in Denver. And unfortunately. But they can go home with that peace of mind and their families can do.They don't have to change schools. They don't have to pinch those pennies unnecessarily. They don't have to forego lunch at school or dinner at home. They can just go home. Hang their hat. Call it a night. Spend time with family and be back in the morning.And that's exactly what retention. Yes, it is much more than just the job and some position and some cost savings is in people's families. And I think the the workers organized through Local 23 have done that. And I'm very proud of our councilwoman and that district of of being steadfast and making sure that that that was apriority. We all were visited as well to and communicated with on council. And I'm very proud of this council, very proud of being part of a council that understands and an airport that does that as well, too. Now, do I like Cherry Creek?Absolutely. Is there an opportunity, I think, for us to expand? Is there a voice here, a collective voice saying that's, you know, we want to be able to understand what those parameters are. And then and that way everybody who applies, understands the role, understands that they're the apply terribly similarly.Absolutely. But I think this is definitely a victory for the workers. And DIA was one of those airports that there is none other like it in the country. So, yes. Did I have those reservations? Absolutely still do. But that victory right here, we have a lot of residents that are going to go home and still have ajob at the end of the day. And I hope we look at expanding that, not just to concessionaires, not just to the janitors. We shouldn't have to debate this philosophy anymore in these chambers as it would be something that we just do as a common practice in the city.Out of respect. Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Lopez. Councilman Espinosa.Yeah. I just in light of the comments, I just wanted to stress to the airport, you have a lot of workers out there that are making sums that are, well, healthy, not as healthy as others. And so as we're expanding the development potential out there, I stress that you be part of the housing solution for your yourworkforce as you as you, as as these opportunities increase. And so sorry I'm going on on record here just wanted everybody involved district 11 DIA to to be part of the workforce housing solution closer to the airport and think.Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilwoman Sussman.Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to chime in, too, having been a part of writing a lot of RFP and having been also turned down by a lot of RFP. I understand that our fees are very technical documents using language and that they can sometimes be not completely understandable.But I have always had the greatest faith in Denver. DIA Denver Airport for the way in which they've conducted their business. The the carefulness with which they manage the airport, the the attention they paid and the restrictions they have with FAA guidelines.Sometimes we don't always understand those restrictions. And things may seem odd, but. And then that's the federal government. I know that the CIA leadership is as interested in helping local businesses as we are. We all have our favorite burger joints and ours, but also to meet FAA requirements and to respond to an international audience.I mean, not just we want the local businesses, but they also respond to an international audience. And how about that group that just got the USA Today award? It was a USA award for the best restaurants in the United States for airport.And congratulations. That was a great award that you got.Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Any other comments? 133. I will add as well, I am enthusiastically supportive of this. I have no reservations about it. You know, my first job out of the military was with United Airlines at DIA.And so I worked there for two years from oh 6 to 8 and how I wish there would have been a smashburger. Now, my waistline probably does not wish there was a been a smashburger, but to think about the transformation, the restaurant options we had ten years ago, which is really not that long ago to now, istruly remarkable. And that's a testament to the award that we just received. You know, there will always be people that don't win our fees. And so it's good, though, to have questions and scrutiny to make sure that we are have our eyes dotted and our T's crossed.But as I've gone through this entire process, I've never had any reservations about that. I'm excited about a new gourmet concept. Smashburger is something that we do. We lack at the airport, which people have been asking for as a top ten list for concessions.So I'm happy that we have an excited concessionaire to bring a new concept to it and is also excited about the workers. But that's a testament to the concessionaire that we selected because we have to realize they did not have to do that, but they realize how important that is.And they came to the table and say, we will do that. So I think it's important that we congratulate them for coming forward to have that conversation to ensure because they are new to the new to the DIN team as well as bringing in HDB.I believe Councilman Brooks said from the five point his hood as well. So this is a very exciting proposition and I think the Dentyne made a great choice and I look forward to seeing this and other successful concepts to come in the near future.So, you know, the comments were brilliant and. 133 Madam Secretary, roll call.ORTEGA Nope. SUSMAN Hi, Black Eye Brooks. CLARK Hi, Espinosa. FLYNN Hi. Gilmore I. Cashman can eat. LOPEZ All right, new.

What would you like for us to do with this?I need to call this out to abstain.Absolutely. Yes. So we will first get it on the floor and then I'll I'll come right back at you for comments. Councilwoman Gilmore, would you please move to have 138 adopted?Thank you, Mr. President. I move that resolution 138 be adopted.Moved and seconded. Counsel comments.

Next, we have the bills for introduction 134. I believe council members Ortega and Nu, either one of you want to call that out for a vote?Councilwoman Ortega I need it for a vote for a similar reason as the previous one.Got it. All right. And, Councilman Nu, did you have a comment? Do you have a vote as well?Just a comment.All right, Councilman Gilmore, it's day 134. Could you have one 3442 published?Thank you, Mr. President. I move that council bill 134 be ordered published.Moved in second and comments. Councilwoman Ortega.I just want to mention that. The full facts. Business Improvement District rents space from Del Norte. And it's not a buy, I guess just because they have city money, somehow city dollars are still involved. So I think it's important to just abstain.So there's not any perception of conflict of interest here.Councilman, do.You know, I just want to voice my pleasure at this new budget that they've adopted. It's really addressing the right issues on Colfax. We're looking at safety. We're talking about design for streetscape improvements for our businesses and pedestrians.And and it just fits very well with the big effort that we're having to try to address the economic development of Colfax Avenue. And I just really want to thank Frank like a Dora, as the executive director of the Colfax bid for his leadership.And I just appreciate all they've done and and really support this improved budget. Thank you, sir.Thank you. Councilman, do any of the comments on 134. See none, Madam Secretary. We'll call.Ortega Sussman. All right, Black. All right. Brooks Clark. All right, Espinosa. Flynn. Hi, Gilmore. I Cashman can reach Lopez. I knew, Mr. President.I. Madam Secretary, please cause a very nice results.12 eyes, one abstention.Well, why is one abstention when 34 has been ordered published? Next Bill for Introduction 129 Council Menu. Would you like for us to do with this? Please go right ahead.This is a conversion of Tudor to the new Cherry Creek area zoning. And we we went through we went through the zoning process that you agreed north this property decided to stay is approved. It probably could have converted to the new zoning there and the new ownership of it now is going to take that there's requesting tomove to the new church, rezoning the size of the project. The heights are all the same. There's wide community support for this. And the developer, Mayor Javin, is an excellent developer. He's developing several properties. The Halcyon Hotel is one of his properties in Cherry Creek North.And and this particular apartment building will be a little bit larger units and than what has been specified before. So just want to support this and I think it be a welcome addition to Cherry Creek North.Thank you, Councilman, you. All right. Those are all bills for introduction. We got one more bill and final one. Ten. Councilman Espinosa, would you like for us to do with this?I just wanted to comment. Go right ahead. So I just wanted to thank the artist, Emmanuel Martinez, for an incredible depiction of an incredible individual, Cesar Chavez. And I just wanted to say this anecdotal bit, that the bust is mounted at just the right height so that when you must lift up your head just enough to changeyour perspective, to view it. And I think that's significant. And but it's not so high that you think that Cesar Chavez was larger than life. And that's a good thing, because that strength of character is in all who choose to tap into it.And I think that's an important artist's move. So I'm glad that this bust is being accepted by the city and county of Denver because it's a great contribution, a great piece in Cesar Chavez Park in District one. Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Espinosa, Councilwoman Cannick.Thank you. Mr. President, I, too, want to just comment on this exception. This is the closest neighborhood park to my house, and my son and I are probably there two or three times a week in weather like we've had.And I think that we sometimes, you know, park meetings, you know, they feel very controversial at the time, but then the importance of the name tends to fade. And this is an example, though, where the artwork and the name of this park creates a conversation opportunity on a daily basis.And so almost every time we go, my son asks some question about Cesar Chavez and we talk about farmworkers and grapes and Latino immigrants and equality. And each time, you know, the older he gets, the more he can understand about the story.And so and I think that, you know, this kind of an artwork that creates both beauty, but memory of history and acknowledgment of social movement is particularly important in North Denver, which is changing. And so maybe not as many Latino families it is there used to be and trying to keep that history and make sure that wekeep the integrated history going as we work to create more affordable housing solutions and preserve that diversity in the neighborhoods so we don't lose more of it. So so I just I, too, want to thank Councilman Espinosa for calling this out.\nSummary:", "answer": "Approves a contract with MCE-DIA, LLC doing business as Tom’s Urban Kitchen + Brewery, Roasting Plant, Smashburger & Bar for a minimum annual percentage fee $1,960,000 and for ten years in length and grants the concessionaire the right to construct and use facilities at DEN to serve the traveling public and employees at DEN (PLANE 201523998)."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nItem nine is a report from Development Services.

I received numerous emails today along with a big report from staff, and I think I need to circle back with the city attorney on this issue before we move forward on this item.Second.There's been emotion in a second. Is there any member of the public that wish to address Council on item nine? Please come forward stating that.Very good you able to support the council and so sage suggestion this is a just to understand this is a very. Very indicative project of some of the problems we face and the dollar amount that's being urinated down the drain by what is being suggested here would go to pay for projects that would benefit the public muchbetter. Leeway Center is an excellent facility. The kids that are the staff that produces the product, i.e. teaching kids how to sell, are second to none. They do a tremendous job. When those kids come out of that program, they can sail better than their parents.But what happened is we got some people involved that hadn't the faintest idea about boating, about sailing, and indeed, the city had to fire the first consultant because he forgot about the fact that sail boats, sailboats move by sails.The sails move by wind. He blocked all the wind so everybody would be sitting there in the bay in that area without any wind. In addition to that, the size of this facility is being almost tripled, which is absolutely useless.It's a pure waste of money. It's indicative of the West, Hollywood, west of bullying damage this city has done. So I think when this comes back next week, you'll see some more details ending and be able to adopt a more intelligent course than it's sitting here in front of you now.Thank you.Thank you.

The last time something this.Big and.Exciting happened in Midtown on Home Street was on.2016. The Beach Street.The bringing of the parade will bring thousands of foot traffic and a.Potential customer to the to the diverse businesses in midtown. And over 100 so many businesses will benefit from it. I would like to thank Vice Mayor De Andrew and Councilman.Nelson Pinol for helping to.Bring back the parade and helping the businesses in.Midtown. Lastly.I would like to invite.Everyone to visit.Shop and dine in Midtown. We have the best authentic Cambodian food and Mexican food in the city. Thank you.Thank you. That is true. So they can be.He's definitely right because hacking and Alzheimer's are both fun and I'm street in and I'm corridor so I couldn't agree with you more and I know that as a resident I am in complete support of. This motion. I think it's a vital opportunity for the city to shine a spotlight on our Cambodian community here in Long Beach, as well as an ample opportunity for increased economic development of the midtown Anaheim corridor, as was just stated. You know, I was at the Beat Street, uh, in 2016, and it was great to have people from outside of our neighborhood come into an area that isn't necessarily frequented in the manner that other business corridors, such as SecondStreet or Fourth are. But it's it's always a great opportunity where we can balance our cultural emphasis with the financial and simultaneously. So I want to give thanks to the vice mayor injuries and cancer supernova for coming together and supporting this.Thank you.Thank you. That concludes public comment. I just have a couple of questions for Mr. Modica. So I completely support this this motion. I think that one of the great things about our city, of course, is the diversity of of our festivals and parades.And obviously, we have a handful of really active parades that happen throughout the year. Many of those parades obviously are supported by community, by the community or businesses in the city in some cases as well. And I just want to make sure, Mr. Modica, I know that obviously this parade had had been happening for many years andhasn't obviously happened just in the last I think it's been maybe a couple a couple of years. How many years is it then? Is it been. Has it been that long? Wow. It's already been a really five or six years.Five years. Okay. And so I would just ask Mr. Modica and I think hopefully the council supportive as well, that because this parade is really trying to come back and I do believe they need additional support and consideration from the city as it relates to the expenses of putting on a parade like this.And so I just ask that we do everything that we can through look through the public safety costs and other issues that are there to work with the parade organizers just to make sure that we give them the breathing room to be able to restart this parade.And I think that we all know that. All of the parades that happen in the city are difficult to put on and they're costly and there's an expense, and we know that. But restarting a parade kind of from scratch again is even harder.And so I think especially in this first year, I'm just hopeful that the city can can give a Cambodia town mid-town the parade just some additional support to try to get this restarted. I think it's an important part there.There are there are not other large Cambodian parades that happen in the United States. And so this is very unique to Long Beach, and it needs to come back and be successful. Mr. Marker, can you address that?Sure.Yeah, we'll be very sensitive to that. You know, you're absolutely right. When you have a parade that is just starting, there's things that you don't know to plan for. So we recently saw that with the Veterans Day parade.That had been a long standing parade. But this year, the city took it over. And when you make that transition, there are some things that you have to do to make sure that it's successful. So we would be more than happy to look at this.We'd work with both the council officers who are funding it and do what we can out of special events and PD to make sure it's a success.I appreciate that. And I think that the contribution that Councilman Andrews and Councilmember Superman are making from their district funds, I think is really significant and important. But I think, as you know, to put on a parade, it is quite costly, especially to restart one.And so I'm hoping that that you can personally get involved in assisting the Special Events Department in ensuring that this happens and to support the group. So thank you, Mr. Mordecai. Appreciate your support on that. Councilman Mongo.You know, as a person who has participated in a lot of parades in the city in a very short amount of time, the Cambodian parade was and the festival beforehand and the ceremonies were very meaningful to me and learning more about the culture.I got pregnant and then had a baby and I assumed that I just missed them because I was either in the hospital having a baby or after that. And to know that that hasn't been going on just hurts my heart.And so I'm just so thankful that you guys brought this forward and to both Mayor Andrews and Councilmember Suber and offer really financially supporting this and bringing it back. Congratulations and looking forward to it.Thank you. And we look forward to attending. And with that members, please cast your votes.John Kerry.\nSummary:", "answer": "Recommendation to increase appropriations in the Special Advertising and Promotion Fund Group in the City Manager Department by $25,000, offset by the $5,000 of the Fourth Council District One­time District Priority Funds and $20,000 of the Sixth Council District One-time District Priority Funds, transferred from the Citywide Activities Department to provide donations to Cambodia Town Inc. for the 2020 Cambodian New Year Parade; and \r\n\r\nDecrease appropriations in the Special Advertising and Promotion Fund Group in the Citywide Activities Department by $25,000 to offset a transfer to the City Manager Department."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nReport from Parks, Recreation and Marine Recommendation to receive and file the Howden Park Conceptual Plan District nine.Transformative stuff.Thank you, Mayor. Council members, we have a report by Parks Rec, Marine Director Steven Scott and project manager Meredith Reynolds.Honorable Mayor and members of the City Council. The item before.You tonight is to.Provide a brief report on the Highland Park Conceptual.Plan. This conceptual plan was borne out of the planning process for the Highland Park Community Center, which began a little over a year ago in September of 2014. During the community center planning.Process, feedback was.Received from the community that extended beyond the walls of the proposed community center, illuminating the community's desire to plan for the park.The future of the park as a whole.In response.To that input in June of this year, the Department kicked off this planning.Process for the Highland Park Conceptual Plan.I'm now going to turn over the presentation to Meredith Reynolds. Our park development.Officer will provide a.Brief summary of the community.Outreach process and an overview.Of the elements of the Highland Park conceptual plan.Good evening, Mayor. Members. City Council. The purpose of this planning process was to create a comprehensive conceptual plan inclusive of Howden Park in its entirety, which is a 31 acre site located between Atlantic Avenue, East Harding Street, Myrtle Avenue and Jordan High School.The outcome of this process was a conceptual plan that outlined desired park amenities that are to help guide future investment in the park. This is the first of many steps toward rehabilitation of the park amenities. And to understand the how and park site, we first started with a review of.The different aspects of the park.This included site access and transportation routes, utilities on site and off site, amenities and opportunities and constraints. Following an evaluation of existing site conditions at Halton Park.The first of two community workshops was held on.June 27, 2015 at the Halton Park.Community Center.Over 30 participants attended the first Interactive Community Workshop, which included a presentation of background and site information, a site awareness walking tour where participants recorded.Their site observations at each tour stop in a.Workbook format. Individual and group discussions of tour findings such as issues and opportunities. Safety, security, parking and activation. And a group design charrette to graphically.Express ideas on site.Maps. Individual participant feedback was presented to the larger group, and a group design charrette commenced to graphically express consensus for elements of the proposed conceptual plan. The information received at the first workshop was then evaluated and summarized and presented in a draft conceptual plan at the second Community Workshop held on August 29th, 2015, at the Howden ParkCommunity Center. Many of the attendees from the first workshop also participated in the second. Participants were able to confirm that the project team and accurately reflected the information provided at the first workshop. The general consensus from participants was that the draft conceptual plan reflected the desires of the community expressed through the process.Extensive community outreach was performed for both community workshops, including fliers, social media, online presence.And also activating networks of.Community groups to share information as well as the Imagine Outcome website. The conceptual plan shown here is a result of a community process that arrived at a consensus around the elements listed on the screen in front of you is intended that future rehabilitation projects will be implemented as funding is identified.This concludes my presentation and myself and Steven Scott.Are available for questions. Thank you.Thank you. I turn this over to Councilman Richardson.Thank you, Mayor Garcia. So thank you and Meredith for the presentation and for leading this process. We've come a long way to get here to be able to consider this conceptual plan tonight. So since the 1930s, Highland Park has stood as a central meeting location in the heart of the North Long Beach community.And I just think it's fitting. We've talked about the Queen Mary. We've talked about a lot of things tonight. Well, now we're talking about Highland Park, which is sort of the the heart of heart of North Long Beach, in my opinion.So this heavy, heavily used park is a common fixture, serving as a meeting place center for activities, a safe route for students walking home from Jordan High on the park's north end. Each year, more than 15,000 youth and teens participate in afterschool and fun day programing to fund April programing.This is the first time since the park's been part since the park was developed nearly a century ago that a comprehensive conceptual planning process has taken place to create a cohesive sense of sense of place and a source of pride in the community of North Long Beach.The conceptual planning process balanced, preserving the green space and the history of the history important to the community with rehabilitation needs of existing amenities, with new amenities needed to serve the population who use the park. The result of this conceptual planning process ensures Highland Park is well positioned for improvements when funding and grant opportunities arise.Our community is excited to begin to begin implementing aspects of this of this plan. I'll just list out a few great things about this plan. There's new parking areas, entry monument signs, a new electronic reader board, fitness stations, hydration state stations, seating areas, a community garden, outdoor basketball courts, additional soccer, upgraded soccer fields, improved picnic shelters, improvementsto our baseball diamond preservations of our trees and our green space, additional lighting and user focused bike paths. So by the end of the year, we'll see the installation of our fitness plan and our hydration stations, which are both paid for by District nine one time funds.And the North Long Beach Heal Zone, Kaiser Permanente funded initiative in the ninth District. So I want so I'll just take this moment to just invite folks to join us as we launch this plan while we cut the ribbon on the fitness zone one week from today, December 24th and 9 a.m. at Horton Park, 63 on MyrtleAvenue. So that said, excuse me, November. So that said, I make I move to receive and file the Highland Park conceptual plan and consider a categorical exemption. S.E. 15. Dash 155.Thank you. Councilman Austin.Yes, thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Councilmember Richardson, the many residents who took part in the planning of this process. I know I took I was a privilege to be early, be at some of the early meetings and see some of the conceptual ideas come come to fruition in this plan. We don't get funding without vision and without having a plan. And so it's great to have a master plan for Highland Park. It is a North Lawn Beach resource. It's the only regional park, I believe, in the north part of our city.We spent the last couple of weeks talking about the need for green space, active green space. I think this is certainly in line with that vision and we'll continue to work together to make this this this plan come to fruition, hopefully sooner than later.Thanks.Councilman Tauranga.Thank you. The buildings that are there, I know that they house some some programs there. I know that the health department has a family preservation project. And within those buildings, there was also some services provided through the work program there.Healthy Babies, I think was also fun that was working out of there. Is your plan to upgrade the the internal offices in those buildings?Honorable Mayor, members of the City Council.The facilities that you're speaking of are were not included as part of the conceptual plan. This was more for.The park specific.Activities. That being the amenities.Related to recreational programing.Such as soccer field, baseball fields.But that facility was not included in the plan. Perhaps, Councilmember Richardson, or perhaps you might want to add sometime in the future, look at some upgrades for some of those buildings, because I've been in those offices and they could definitely use some some upgrades.The ninth District field office is in there for many, many years. In that building, we're very familiar with it. It just received some improvements, some paint jobs and things like that. The focus here was about optimizing the park and we'll continue those conversations.Thank you. Councilman Andrews.Yes. Thank you, Mayor. I just want to, first of all, congratulate Councilman Richardson. You know, I just see what you guys are doing is just wonderful, especially out there, you know, in the ninth District, you know, I was there in the parade and get a chance just to watch some of the improvements that you have taken tomake your nightstick, you know, just look great. And I just want to commend you on that hard work and also for Parks and Rec for getting behind this project here. Congratulations.Thank you. Public comment, please, on the item.And Cantrell and I. I see they've taken the picture off. I had some questions about what is being done with the soccer field. I see it mentioned that there was going to be a. Rehabilitation of it. Is that how upgraded?And I'm wondering how this is going to be upgraded. Most of our soccer, all of our soccer fields that I'm aware of in the parks have just been. Any place. There's not trees, there's open space, and they've used the grass that's there.And we found out that that really doesn't work with soccer fields. Like the baseball fields, they have to be installed. With a sand. Layered for drainage and because of gophers, there should be galvanized wire put down to keep the gophers out.And then a special kind of turf that will keep that will last with a lot of play. And there is natural grass turf that stands up to play. And I'm hoping that when you. Doing this, redoing this soccer field at Helton that you will consider putting in a soccer field that's going to serve the children that areplaying on it. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Thank you, Mayor Garcia and.Our council members, for taking the time.To listen to us talk about this great program.I want to give a shout out to Rex besides just being just a great idea.And much needed in our district.Since we're the densest sixth district and probably the district with the least amount of green space per resident. This upgrade is long overdue and it's really exciting to see. But most importantly, I think that's the process that Rex and Shauna and the ninth District staff has been has presented to us to include the district members and theresidents. To come in to be a part of it is probably the most exciting thing of all. I mean, we're talking about civically engaging people who have either dropped out and didn't think no one ever cared about them or giving them a chance to learn how the civic process processes.It's been fabulous. It's been really exciting to have architects, big name architects with big contracts come in and listen to you and implement small ideas into big plans. So I'm really happy about the process that has taken on.I'm so glad that you guys are paying some.Attention to North Long Beach because we love it. And we're actually starting to feel like you like us.So thank you so much.Thank you, Speaker, please.Good evening. Honorable there. Council members and staff. My name is Dan Pressburger.I'm the president of the De Force Neighborhood Association. I'm just speaking to the issue.This is a great time for us. It's a lot of excitement for us. Happy to have this happen. Thank you, Rex. Thank you, Al. And I don't think there's needs to be much more said.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Good evening to Mayor Garcia and the council members, especially Councilman Richardson in Austin, helped in part play a major role in providing open space and meeting. And meeting the recreation needs in North Long Beach. The facilities are used by many groups.Including seniors. Our youth and uplifting youth and teen programs. Many different community groups. The park also served as the location for most of the cultural and civic events held in the ninth District.And.This plan was developed, this plan. Many of the citizens in Long Beach spent time in developing this plan. This is we really look forward to the improvement because the park as I say, the park is very well used and we look forward to it.Thank you. My name is Otis Hogan and I am I am the chairman of the co-chair of the Highland Park Neighborhood Association and a member of the Human Relations Commission. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Howdy. Hey, I'm going to keep this very brief. First of all, I want to compliment everybody here for this. This park. I mean, it's been long overdue. Fantastic ideas. All these concepts in place is fantastic. The way this thing looks like it's.Uh, working out just great. Um, the question that I have is same as what end control we're saying is that there's a concern over the soccer fields, and we're trying to have we're having some trouble. I'm from District five, not from District nine.One of the problems that we're having is we don't know what documents were driving the artificial turf versus grass. It seems like there's a controversy, but there's not a controversy. And so this is kind of what I am going to ask for, is that are we going to have artificial is the plan to have artificial fields overthere or is it grass? And what is driving document that that that will be pushing that or will that be something to be decided at a later time? We're having a lot of trouble struggling with this, with this at least a lot of the residents in different districts at this time.And it looks like there's also a big struggle among the city of some sort to to decide that this and we are also having apparently last week there was a problem with an issue where there were a. A developer was saying that the city was telling him that that they needed to have artificial turf, at least buildartificial turf. And I'm just kind of wondering where this is coming from. The memo that I saw that was created by the Parks and Recreation before Steve Scott was there by a guy named George, actually was dated, I think, June 15th of this year.And it recommended artificial turf of the, you know, more expensive. I think it was the chrome, not chrome, but it was like a coconut filled thing. And then we know, even though it hasn't been put on the table, there was a chrome rubber, you know, thing.And then I mean, there's been a lot of things going on. But the basic rationale for the. Using artificial turf was. That it was a water issue. And then we have Ms.. Mungo here saying that, oh, water is not an issue.So we have the city in conflict. And I'm just kind of wondering, where are we at in that point now? What do we what do we work? And if somebody could help enlighten me, I'd appreciate that. That's all I have.Thank you, sir. See no other public comment on the Hutton Park masterplan here. Members, please go and cast your vote. There is a motion and a second.Motion carries.Great. Congratulations to the community. And now we have to fund it. And so now that's the next big challenge. And and we're all actively working on that as well. And so we know that's a big deal to the community.So thank you.

So I understand that the three that are up tonight are for renewal because they expire in a couple of weeks. There are a number that are scheduled to expire in 2017.

Councilman Flynn's predecessor, predecessor, served on that board for gosh, I can't even remember how many years he was the council representative for many years on this board. And then we had Charlie Brown serving representing city council.And it was a way to make sure that city council knew what was going on. It's not to say the administration doesn't always share things with us, but by having a representative, I think it's it's just another way to ensure that's part of the discussion when we have retreats and, you know, just general discussions about the currentconditions of the city. So I am okay voting for these to move forward.

Tonight you have before you an application for entertainment without dancing formal hospitality LLC doing business as Ashley's. Located at 1731 East Fourth Street, operating as a restaurant with alcohol in Council District two.All of the necessary departments have reviewed the application and have provided their recommended conditions as contained in the hearing packet. I, as well as the police department, stand ready to answer any questions Council may have. And that concludes staff's report.Thank you. The transfer of the council appears.Yes. Thank you very much. I want to thank staff for your work with the applicants. And I want to give a little bit of context because I know I've had some dialog with some of the constituents in the area.As many of you guys know, Fore Street and Between Cherry and Alamitos is one of the key areas that we are trying to make sure we have monthly cleanups, that we have our businesses meeting. And I just want to say that the owners of this establishment have done a fantastic job about opening up.And we've had not just community meetings there, we've had public safety meetings where we've had our commanders come down not only work with the community members, but work with the business owner and making sure that we do our crime prevention through environmental design with them.And so I wanted to invite the applicant up just to give a little bit of context to the history of of Ashley's and ask them to speak. And then I'd ask for my council colleagues full support on this.Thank you.Thank you.Hello, Mr. Mayor and Council. Thank you for taking this time to review. We took over. Ashley's back in February now. And what is. What a journey it's been? Being down in that area is much different than the other businesses that we have and being coming from.Broadway and Councilwoman Susie Price's district and opening of the attic and cleaning up that area then going to saloon and fourth and cherry over there and trying to clean up what was over there. And now being a little bit further down, we've we've noticed the amount of work that's ahead of us.What we plan to do here. We're obviously restaurant people. We're not bar style people. But what the place is now is is a bar. And we plan to take take what's there now and make turn it into a restaurant for the future.And what we're asking for is to continue operating the way it is now and give us that time to make sure that we we do the right things there with what's what's there now that can only support so much.And so what we're asking for is give us the time. Let us put the right, right business in there to help clean up the area and to connect it all together. If you guys have any questions, I'll be more.Than happy to ask.Great. Thank you very much. Is there any other public comment on this hearing item? Please come forward.Hello. This is out of my arena. So sorry for my quavering voice. I own a property across the street.From the restaurant.And it's allowed. It's allowed bar before they bought it and they've had a dance competition that was loud. Uh, the people that I live, I purchased in across the street at 1738 East Fourth Street, the apartments in the front turn over quite a lot already because of the noise.Parking is incredibly hard at night and and tenants cannot just easily park in front. So having something that's creating more congestion at night will be hard. The parameters have not been made clear to the people that live in our building.We've gotten a notice from the police department and we've called in thinking that was enough to to create a stir that we don't want this. But now we have a poster that was dated May 23rd, 2013, that was on the public hearing paper.So people were throwing it away, thinking it was mailed egregiously. I was told we couldn't get this on a later date, that this was good enough because buried in the in the text is the real time for this meeting tonight.And people couldn't take time off of work. I did. I getting a I had a run around just trying to get somebody to tell me what are the parameters? Well, how is this going to go if we do have Senate Bill 905 pass?Are we having live music till 4 a.m.? I mean, I just think we really need to think about this a little harder before we go. Yahoo! They've got some nice businesses. I wish they would do something a little more like what he's got in the attic.And salud. Across the street from my building. But I guess we just because we are on the other side of cherry, we're going to go loud and crazy. It's a beautiful 1923 building that we've got and we've put a lot of money into it to make it nice.We we sweep the trash, you know, twice a week and we've redone the the the outside plants and it's newly painted. And now we're going to get a bar that's open till 2 a.m. with live music. I don't think that's really going to be adding to my property value.I really wish you would reconsider and really have some parameters. They're very clear about what it's going to mean for that. About one block. I thank you for your consideration.Thank you. With that, we'll go back to the council on this public hearing. Councilmember, did you have anything, Councilman Austin. Nope. Back to Councilmember Pearce.Great. Thank you. I do want to ask that you or my staff will follow up with you in every body that sent the letters that we haven't talked to so you can see the parameters of the night. I do want to clarify for the forum what's on the table right now is a is just for downtown, anentertainment district that I would not at this current time should it pass impacts where you were at. And I also want to echo that. I'm not sure if you guys have had the opportunity to work together, but definitely want you and my staff, Connor, who's sitting up there to work with Steve as well.I think that the vision for the property is what we need to have on Fore Street.

And again, I encourage my council to to pass this because we know that doing the step is the right step and that we can continue to work on noise mitigation and other issues as we have them there a little bitlonger.

The code declaring an emergency and establishing an immediate effective date.All might be forced out of the city council.Thank you, Madam Clerk. I will move to pass Council Bill 119803. Is there a second?Thank.It's been moved and seconded to pass the bill. Councilmember Herbold, you are the prime sponsor of this bill, so I am going to recognize you in order to address this item.Thank you so much. So today we're voting on Council Bill 11 9803, which will require officers to display their badge numbers while allowing mourning bands to observe the death of officers on a different part of the badge. Many, many constituents have contacted the council, alarmed that batch numbers were not visible in the two weeks following the murderof George Floyd. After I announced that I was drafting legislation, Chief Bass issued a directive to all officers to display their badge numbers while wearing mourning bands. I, of course, appreciate that order, but believe that this policy must be adopted into state city law.The legislation amends Section 3.28130 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which was created after the 1999 WTO protests, when people noted at that time that they could not view the nametags of officers. So then former City Council member Peter Steinberg sponsored legislation to create a new section of the municipal code to require display of nametag.This legislation is emergency legislation. So it will go into effect immediately upon signature of the mayor within the next ten days. It would not have the additional 30 day waiting period for non-emergency legislation. The bill also requests that the Seattle Police Department work with all other law enforcement agencies whose police officers reasonably may be anticipated to enforcetraffic or criminal laws in Seattle pursuant to Chapter ten point. Our CW to develop a policy that would require these peace officers when enforcing these laws to conform with requirements concerning badges, ID devices, departmental ID on uniforms and oral ID that is consistent with Seattle Municipal Code Section 3.28.130.The Seattle Police Department is required by Seattle City Council with a proposal for the policy by January 2021. Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember Herbold, for that description and for introducing this important bill. Are there any comments or questions on this bill? Hey, I'm not hearing or seeing any. Again, I want to thank you, Councilmember Herbold. I think we have all discussed this bill quite a bit before today and do agree with the approach that you've described, whichis which is about not just allowing this kind of policy to exist at the discretion of whomever might be the chief, but to actually make sure that this is made concrete and long lasting through through legislation. And, of course, a future council could disagree with their policy position and change that.But I think it's pretty clear that this council agrees very strongly that this should be the policy and that it should be codified in law and not just exist in a in a in a police manual or in a directive from from the chief.So appreciate the wisdom in nonetheless moving forward this legislation and appreciate you bringing this for our consideration. Because remember state I see that you raise your hand, please.Thank you very much. Council member Herbold, thank you for bringing forward this legislation. I just wanted to ask you a question, both as a sponsor of this legislation and as chair of public safety. We know that even after the chief issued that directive, we heard reports of individuals who are still recovering batch numbers.Can you remind folks what to do if they see that happen after this ordinance has passed and.What the process should be?It would be a violation of both MPD policy and city law. The Office of Professional Accountability has a a complaint process to investigate complaints of violation of city policy. And there's also the ability of an investigation, of the violation of city law to to go along the investigation of the violation of city city policy.I do want to note that batch numbers are in different places on different people's badges. Sometimes they're in the center and sometimes they're at the bottom. And I know that some of the examples of covered badge numbers that I saw after Chief Best's order had badges, had the had the tape through the middle, and there was actuallya badge number at the bottom of the badge. And in some instances, I, of course, have not seen every example of every complaint. There are the this issue is is one of the sort of the the top ten issues that the Office of Professional Accountability is looking at as it relates specifically to the volume of complaints thatthey've received.Thank you. And either questions or comments. All right. Hearing that, I'm going to ask that the clerk please call the role on the passage of the bill.Peterson I.Want.Strauss i.Herbold i.Whereas.Hi.Lewis. Hi. We're Alice. I let's get a. Mosquito. I President Gonzalez. Hi. Nine in favor and unopposed.Thank you so much.

Recommendation to establish a policy for the COVID 19 Emergency Rental Relief Program to determine eligibility for expedient processing and payment to residents. And request that city staff reach out to landlords who have issued eviction notices to advise them on the ability to apply forexpedited processing.Of a motion and a second count. Summary Oranga.Thank you, Mary. I want to thank my colleagues up close. A woman said there has sorrow and Vice Mayor Rick Richardson for joining me on this on this topic. COVID 19 has had a major negative impact on working families and led to the most significant economic downturn that has ever been seen in decades erode.State and local agencies have put together an economic recovery package that includes rent relief. However, in many cases, these payments are not coming soon enough. Because current evictions, the foreclosure protections expire on June 30th. Many of those who were hit hardest by the pandemic may be facing eviction or even homelessness in the coming months.That is why it is paramount importance that we identify and prioritize residents who are in immediate danger of eviction so that they can receive the support they need to stay in their homes. And I want to also note that many of the families that are affected by this, they have until June 30th.That's been the state deadline. We need to act quickly. And unfortunately, we're not meeting in the next couple of weeks. It is imperative that this this item pass. So I would appreciate the support of my colleagues. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Urine. I'll offer my second here and simply say, I think we know that conditions are going to change if and when the eviction moratorium deadline is lifted. And I think this is smart. It allows staff the flexibility if there is an urgent situation and someone's going to they're in the pipeline and and something isabout to happen. I think staff needs to be able to have the flexibility to do so. And I think the point here is simply just to keep people in their homes. And that's why we set up the program and that's what it is that we want we want accomplished.So I'm happy to support this here. I know that a portion of the funds we talked about and maybe, maybe this has already happened, but but this is city manager. Did we do the back rent? We set up a structure for people to apply for maximum back rent.Where are we with that? Is that already? Is that all that funding already gone out or is that still eligible under the funding that we have?Um. I believe what background is eligible. We are just getting underway with issuing payments. So we've got, if I remember the stats right, about 36 million or so of people have applications and then they go through a vetting process and they go through all the different federal requirements and state requirements.So we have been issuing checks just as of last week. I think about two or so million dollars went out the door. And I believe that back rent is a part of that within the within the parameters.Okay. I think this most closely aligns with the background portion of this, but I'm happy to support it.Thank you. So what we're looking here to do, just so I can clarify, is we're not changing any of the criteria. Those are all set in state and federal law. And Christopher is here. He can help me out if I say something incorrect.But we are expediting those who are in urgent need of being potentially evicted, that we will be processing their payments first so that we can kind of move them to the front of the line and make sure that they're eligible for those that meet the criteria.So, Christopher, anything like Mr. Toms?Absolutely correct. We don't have the ability of one or two to change any of the eligibility criteria, but we do have discretion and we want to help people. So if someone has an active eviction notice, they need to let us or the vendor know we'll take them out of order.We'll process that as expeditiously as we can. And the most important thing, though, is getting people to apply at all. We've done an amazing job to get people into this program, but there are still people that have not applied.We are in contact with your staffs all the time. We need your help to meet, to find those final people that have not yet applied and get them into this program. Thank you. Councilman's in the house.Thank you. Thank you very much to city staff. And thank you so much, Mr. Koontz. I know that you've been doing an incredible job on this, and I thank you and my residents. Thank you. This pandemic brought so much pain to so many families.It put many out of work and left people with no steady source of income to purchase food, pay bills, or even pay rent. As we come out of this pandemic, it is important to do our best to connect folks with the emergency resources available as the emergency COVID relief rental relief program that is meant to help familiesstay in their home. I want to thank Council member Wodonga Vice Mayor Van Richardson and Councilwoman Sorrell for supporting this item that calls for the rental relief application process to prioritize those who are on the verge of facing eviction.I also hope to continue seeking outreach and being contact seeking outreach that is being conducted citywide to ensure that folks receive access to information about this opportunity and are available to apply as soon as possible. As as you know, city staff, me and my staff are ready and and willing to reach out, do all the outreach wecan, and also reach out to our and to our community based organizations who are out there every day with our trying to help our community and our residents with this particular aspect of rent relief. So thank you again very much.Thank you, Councilman Allen.Thank you, Mayor. And I also want to say thank you to council and your ranga for bringing this item forward and to Vice Mayor Rex Richardson and Councilwoman Zendejas and Councilman Ciro for signing on to this very important item.This is this is this is very, very critical, especially with the state and the county protections that are set to expire on June 30th. It's vital that we take this action to protect both the tenants and landlords who have experienced financial loss due to COVID 19.And it's also important that we expedite this relief where it is needed. And I know I can tell you that my residents thank you for this item. So I'm happy to support this today.Thank you, Councilwoman Saru.Yes. I want to thank Councilmember Yanga for bringing this item forward and my colleagues, Vice Mayor Richardson and Councilwoman Sun. As for signing on. And, you know, I think my colleagues have shared so urgent that we do something as a city to protect our renters.And I want to thank development services for their amazing hard work and ensuring that we're getting the word out and assistance through the emergency rental assistance program. I just have a few questions. And with this is what currently is the turnaround time for processing and payment to residents?And the second question is what happens to residents while they're waiting for processing and payment? You know, if they applied prior to that June 30th, when the eviction moratorium ends, I won't know what happened to them while they're waiting for their payments to be processed.Sure. Thank you for the question, Councilmember. And similar to the discussion earlier tonight, you know, we accept applications in any level of completeness. So while it should only take about ten days to process an application, it has been taking much longer than that, a couple of months to process these applications because we'll be missing information from thetenant. They have to prove not just that they're in financial need, but that COVID was a triggering event. So they don't need to have covered themselves, but they worked in the service industry and lost their job as a result.Or there was some complicating factor tied back to the pandemic, and they have to establish their income and some different things for us. So we gather all of that information and then we need some information from the landlord and we reach out separately to make sure we accommodate that.So we need their W-9 tax information. We need to verify the amount of the lease. We contact the utilities to see if there's back utility payments. We put all of that together. We go through an audit process and then we issue a check.The tech goes to the landlord for the background. But the good news is, even though that can take some time to process, you know, step two after we receive an application is to contact the landlord. We're in the process of paying this outstanding amount, you know, and we want you to accept payment.So in the event that someone is behind you by facing an eviction, we'd be working with the landlord to let them know that that payment is forthcoming so that they would stop any proceedings. And 99.9% of the landlords are very accommodating.And we have a different procedure for if the landlord is not, you know, doesn't want to accept the payment or is not accommodating. And then as a last, last, last resort, we have a separate program that we cooperate with the county, which is a right to counsel program, which does provide legal counsel to the tenant to disputethe eviction if that should become necessary. And the vast, vast majority of cases, we're working cooperatively with the landlord, with the tenant, and that's not necessary. But that is available as a kind of backstop.Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember Brenda.Thank you. And I thank you, Mr. Koontz, for that explanation. I was going to ask a question about our our ability to work with landlords in implementing this program. And you were right on. Thank you very much.Any public comment on this item?There's no public comment on this item.Thank you. I think I've come from an and there's.Thank you, Mary. May I just have one quick question for our staff. Are we trying to one of the things that I think is deterring some of my residents from applying for this is may be the rigorous documentation that that needs to be filled.Is there a way that it can be simplified or can we look into possibly simplifying that process?Sure. Council Member So I really would encourage people to apply and provide what they can and then talk to us about what they can't provide. So I wish it was even simpler. We have to please in this program, both federal regulators and state regulators, both of whom have different ideas about how to make it simple.So it's not perfectly simple, but when a tenant is not able to provide a document. So, for example, oftentimes people maybe they don't file taxes or they just don't have a copy of a prior year tax return. There is a way to do a sworn declaration as to their income level.So we work with them. We they could submit the application online. They could call the hotline. We've been doing outreach events in person in your district and around. And in that case, we actually have staff, you know, help the individual fill out the application right there live.So we really are able to work through people's situations, including, you know, missing a document or not having something that we're requesting. But we do need them to take that first step of, you know, engaging with us and starting the application process.Thank you very much. Mr.. That makes me feel much better. Thank you. And thank you again for also working with our landlords who often get forgotten in this situation. And so thank you very much.Thank you. And that concludes the the agenda items. We will go ahead and do a roll call vote, please.District one. I'm District two. I'm District three. I District four i. District five I. District six I. District seven i.

You cannot spend more money than you collect in taxes.And there is a limit set on how much taxes you can assess. And that dollar, that amount is set annually in. It can be increased annually. And there's two factors that you could use. One of them and each factor has two variables to it.One is the population factor, which gives you to pick either increase in county or the city population, which in our particular case, this time around, the county growth was greater than the city growth. And therefore, we're using account county growth.And the second factor is related to.Per capita income.Yes, the per capita income, which you have two choices.

Councilmember Flynn, your motion to adopt this evening.I move the proclamation 20 2-0338 be adopted.Thank you. We've got it moved and seconded comments by members of council. Councilmember Flynn.Thank you, Madam President. In times like this. When the attention of the world and the anxiety of people all over the world is focused on the humanitarian crisis in Eastern Europe caused by a war of choice. It prompts us all.Or it should. To reflect on our interconnectedness. With everyone in the world. We come from all over the world. My wife, Harriet, is a second generation American. Her mom's parents were born and her mom's grandparents were born in Finland, but her dad's parents both were born her her dad, grandpa, her grandparents I'm sorry, her dad's parents bothwere born in what was at the time around the turn of the century, the late 1800s was the Principality of Galicia. Which is now part of it is in western Ukraine. And part of it is in eastern Poland.It is exactly ground zero. Where much of this fighting is taking place. And she is said to be several times. Watching the news over the last month. That is, without doubt, some of her relatives. Our refugees right now.Some of her blood relations. Some may have been killed. Peace. According to the great Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw, peace is not only better than war. But infinitely more arduous. We are all at a distance here, at least at a loss.As to what we can do. In this crisis. Abraham Lincoln once predicted in a famous speech. That quote, the world will little note nor long remember what we say here. He was famously wrong, of course, when he said that at Gettysburg during another war.But I am certain that he is correct when he says that about what we're saying here this evening. I am fairly certain that President Putin of Russia will never even hear of the words that we are voting on tonight.I have no illusion about that. However, it was back in the early sixties that MIT mathematician Edward Lorenz developed the chaos theory, popularly known as the Butterfly Effect, which says that even the gentlest fluttering of a butterfly swings in China.Could eventually contribute to a convergence of events that result in a tornado in the Midwest of the United States. So with that in mind, I ask the 13 butterflies up here to flutter our wings. And express outrage. And what is happening in Ukraine.And to urge others to join in and do what they can in the cause of peace. Thank you, Madam President.Thank you. Councilmember Flynn, Councilmember Black.Thank you, Councilman Flynn, for writing that proclamation and for your really beautiful remarks that you just read. It does matter that we're all here standing up with Ukraine. I agree with you about the butterfly effect. People all over our country want to stand in solidarity with Ukraine and it does matter.President Zelensky last week gave a speech and he implored people across the world to stand against this war coming in, come in the name of peace, come with Ukrainian symbols to support Ukraine, to support freedom, to support life.Come to your squares, to your streets. Make yourselves visible. And her heard. The world must stop this war. So on Sunday, most councilmen join me in hosting a Ukrainian solidarity event at Baby R Park. A special thank you to council members Gilmore, Ortega, Cashman, Flynn and Clark for joining us there.We had Ukrainians in Colorado there and a number of other organizations. It was a very, very special event filled with prayer and solidarity. And it was held at Baby R Park, which is in my district. It is a very special park.It's a memorial of the Nazi massacre of 200,000 Jews and Ukrainians who were murdered at the Babi Yar Ravine in Kiev, Ukraine, during World War Two. The park honors the victims of that massacre, but it also sends a message to all of us that we cannot stand by and remain silent and allow these crimes against humanity tohappen, these crimes against our Ukrainian brothers and sisters. So that is why we are here with our butterfly wings, hoping that, you know, that we stand with you. And if there's anything we can do, we will. And we do have our Ukrainians of Colorado representatives here today, and they do have weekly events and fundraising opportunities and volunteeringopportunities. And I'm going to ask all council members to share those on their social media networks so we can get more support for them. Thank you.Thank you. Councilmember Black, Councilmember Hines.Thank you. Council President. I recognize Councilmember Flynn's point about how President Putin might not care about what we do. It is important for us to make a statement. And and I think it is important for my constituents to feel very strongly about this, rightfully so.So while he may not know of our proclamation, I believe, as the butterfly effect, I also believe it is important for us to be intentional in our values. And I see that we're doing that today. I also want to point out that the United Nations 141 of the United Nations member states, 141 countries, voted to denounce Russiafor its invasion. And there has not been that much unity in the United Nations over something that might theoretically be controversial in quite some time. I also want to mention that the governor Polis has has said that Colorado will welcome the Ukrainian refugees, and I certainly think that Denver will do its part as well.So I want to thank the governor for for that statement and his continued statements denouncing Russia and supporting Ukraine. And. Thank you. Council president.Thank you. Councilmember Hines and I want to thank Councilmember Flynn for bringing this proclamation forward, to think of allowing us to weigh in and add some items to it. And then Councilmember Black for your organization and wonderful hosting on Sunday of a very solemn and important event for us to never forget what has happened previously and thenrecognize what is happening and how history is repeating itself, unfortunately, in different ways. And so thank you for all of your work on that and happy to support it this evening. Madam Secretary, roll call can each.I. Sawyer. I. Flynn.I.Herndon High Cashman. Ortega, I. Sandoval.I.Torres I.

Council Member Flynn We have 5 minutes for the proclamation. Acceptance of you. Go ahead and introduce the folks that will accept it this evening.Thank you, Madam President. We have here in the chamber tonight Marina Dubravka of the Ukrainians of Colorado. And she is and I invite her to bring up I think I see Mark Dillon back there and come up to the microphone and you have 5 minutes for remarks.It's so nice to see familiar faces. I would like to start with. Great gratitude to Congresswoman Sandra Bullock and Congressman Kevin Flynn to for inviting us here. And. Making this this proclamation. That's. It's very it's very emotional. And I know that.Putin may not hear this proclamation, but butterfly effect will go through the Internet waves, and I'm pretty sure it will reach him at some point. If not, then Ukrainian soldiers will remind him every time, every day, every second, what the freedom means and democracy and fighting for that.That in the 21st century, on the middle of the Europe, civilized nations are facing right now huge wave of refugees from Ukraine and. The genocide. In the middle of the Europe in Mariupol on. Donbass area. Kiev area. Just you name it.It's endless. And that is. The most heartbreaking. The pain inside. Does not go away. Does not go away. And that's been. Over a month. Oh. So every one of us. Dealt with. Saving our families there and. France unique?Sure. Johanna. She's our president of. National. American League of Ukrainian Women. Yes, she actually her relative was in Mariupol and he was able to escape. I would like, you know, to share that experience. Hi. Yeah, I'm I'm actually the president of the Ukrainian National Women's League here in Denver.And my relative in Mariupol was a distant cousin, like a third cousin, but he happened to be a priest, a parish priest in Mariupol. So he stayed even when there were opportunities to leave because he felt committed to his congregation.But ah, he also had his two of his children with him and somehow, ultimately, after 12 days of being locked up with no water, electricity or food, they somehow managed to get out through one of the green corridors.And I honestly don't know if he's actually made it to Western Ukraine, where he is originally from. But I also do want to thank everyone for passing this proclamation. And I appreciate your energy and time that you put into this.Thank you.Madam President of the Council and members of the Council, I can really add to what a council man, a Flynn and council member, Black Ops said, as well as my colleagues, that we would prefer not to be standing here today.We would prefer to. Be leading much more ordinary lives. We would prefer that there was no need for a proclamation of this nature. We would prefer that there not have been 10 million displaced people in the center of Europe.We would prefer that. 4 million refugees had not had to cross into other countries for safety, including 2 million children. We would prefer all these things, but that was not our choice. Things were done. Things were done to people.People we have a connection to. We. Power with the deepest respect to this Council for taking the action and expressing the sentiments that I think stand not only for the people here assembled, but for many, many Denver rights, many Coloradans.About 20,000 are of Ukrainian heritage. Many, many more have traveled to Ukraine, have relatives in Ukraine. Have taught work that in Ukraine. It is a country. Not that much larger than Colorado, about the size of Texas. It is a country that has cherished democracy for 30 years and now has to defend it.If we stand with them, we are confident that they will be able to do so. Thank you.Thank you very much. And we appreciate you being here. And please know that we do understand that fragile democracy and that that's why it's so important that we uphold democracies throughout the world and support and that our love and support and prayers.But beyond that, the philanthropic and the donations of medical equipment, money that can go to help. And so, as Councilmember Black had alluded to, we'll make sure that each one of our council offices share that information out so that we make sure and maximize getting that help and support.And so please know that we're with you. We're in solidarity with you. And thank you for being here this evening.\nSummary:", "answer": "A proclamation in support of the Ukrainian people and condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nYour councilwoman was I?

For comment under Bill for introduction, I've called out Council Bill 153 for a vote.I've called out Counsel Bill 161 to hold in committee for one week until March six under Bill's for final consideration. We have nothing under pending. We have nothing matter. Madam Secretary.Mr. President, I apologize. I would like to have 163 and 156 for a vote. They could be together in a block. And I because of making the late filing motion, I kind of forgot to do the link through them, and I apologize for that.If we need to vote on them separately, that's. Yeah.Madam Secretary, can we put 156 and 163 in a block, please?Yes.All right, great. We'll make a note of that. Okay. Madam Secretary, please put up the first one. 163. Councilman Flynn, go ahead and make your comment.Thank you, Mr. President. 163 is an agreement between the Office of Economic Development and a development entity on the 16th Street Mall to develop or redevelop the old California Mall property right at 16th in California. And I remember it as the old food court.You go up to the second floor, and when I saw this come across, it gave me a lot of heartburn, Mr. President, because it would bring a new a very good tenant to the mall, one that I think it would be great, wonderful addition catalytic to what I call upto our sort of answer to LoDo.This is up doe and but it was target and I have nothing against Target Corporation. Personally I shop there on occasion, but as some folks may recall, Target had a very wonderful outlet in my district at Sheridan and Evans.And when when Target opened in Belmar, in the Belmar redevelopment in Lakewood, they closed the Target in my district. That alone doesn't give me the heartburn because that's a business decision. But when they left and sold it to an operator who now operates a 99 cent store there, I say we don't even get a dollar store downin my district. We get $0.99 store. They put a deed restriction on the property that it could not be used for 20 years for a general merchandise retailer of 50,000 square feet or greater. And I know from my predecessor, Councilwoman Jeanie Fox, that on at least three occasions a national retailer has looked at that property and haswalked away from redeveloping it because of the deed restriction. However, in the in the course of dealing with this, I was able to meet with guard properties, which is the owner of the California Mall and would be the actual entity with whom we're partnering here, not Target.And I'm very happy to say that they've genuinely outreach to us and they have helped us down in southwest Denver to do market research, to identify potential retailers and possibly even to look at the property as a potential redevelopment.So for the first time in the five or six years since Target left there, we have some we have some interest. I understand the property may also even be on the market now. So given the genuine promise to continue working with us.Mr. President, I will vote yes on this and and plan on that cooperation continuing. Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman.Thank you, Mr. President. I have been very aware of how hard the downtown community has worked to attract retail to this location. It has been a conversation as long as I have been on the council. Not maybe not this particular location, but the vicinity of the 16th Street Mall.And so I don't take lightly the concerns about how to make downtown an attractive destination, to fulfill the needs of the residents and the workers who are downtown. And, you know, I have not, without some consternation, supported some types of redevelopment assistance in this city's history that have involved retail.And, you know, particularly with tax increment financing, it's never been easy. Each deal I take one by one. But overall, I have great concern when we are using city dollars to subsidize retail. It is a non economically sustainable job in our city.For the most part, the average jobs at this site will be 25 hours a week, which is not a full time salary. So even if the wage is slightly above the minimum wage, when you add up the hours, it will keep most families below the poverty line.And we as a city end up having to step in then with childcare assistance and health care assistance and other things. And that's not unique to this location and it's not unique to this retailer. But I do have concerns about using the Business Investment Fund for this purpose.The city has been very disciplined in using the business investment fund, almost with the exception of one other retail job, a retail investment for jobs that are higher than the median wage. And I've appreciated that discipline. It is what kept me supportive of this fund for the period of time.I really struggled with this one and really looked at each a piece of the deal. And I, you know, I would have maybe almost gotten there, but the fact that this agreement is not directly with the retailer and does not give us any privity of contract with them, we do have a history of retailers.\nSummary:", "answer": "A bill for an ordinance making supplemental appropriations from the General Contingency Fund to the General Government Special Revenue Fund.\r\nApproves a $4 million supplemental appropriation from the City’s General Fund Contingency to the Office of Economic Development to support the Business Incentive Fund’s support of a general merchandise mass retail store on the 16th Street Mall at 1601 California Street in Council District 9.

So I just want to make sure that we also allow that our our folks are managing the flow of people that we allow.

All right, so I will now turn this. Open the hearing and turn this over to staff.Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and members of the City Council. This item will be presented by Amy Burdick, our director of development.Services, and Christopher Coons, our advance planning officer.Mr. Mayor. Members of the.City council in the audience, thank you very much for your.Participation and attendance tonight. The sea dip.Ordinance is 41 years old. It is the.Oldest planning ordinance.That we have in the city.We have spent.Over three and a half years updating this.Ordinance, and we were able to do this through the the.Generosity of the state of California, through a California.Department of.Conservation Sustainable Communities.Planning grant.Without that almost $1,000,000 contribution, we would not be able to be here today. I'm going to ask Christopher.Coons to.Provide an overview.Of the three and a half year planning process that culminates.Hopefully this evening. And then also remind you.With the assistance of Mr. City attorney, that this is an appeal hearing.So we will go.Through an appeal process as well.With that, I'm turning it over to Christopher Coons, her advanced planning officer.Good evening, city council members. And so this evening. We're talking about the southeast area specific plan which will replace Planning District one, also known as CDEP up. So this gives you the general area. You've got Seventh Street, which becomes the 22 and the northern area, you've got PCH Highway one running through the center of the site andyou also see Second Street running through the lower portion of the site. So as Amy mentioned, this is a project that was based on community engagement and was community driven. So this project began with meetings large and small to really establish a community vision of what is it that folks want to see in the southeast part ofLong Beach, not just today, but into the future? And this is a plan that reaches out all the way to 2016, but also deals with our issues today and tomorrow. So on the screen, you see some of our our larger meetings and those ranged from community advisory committee meetings, open houses, workshops, drop ins at farmer's markets andother places. But these also involved numerous meetings with existing groups and individuals. If there was a group that wanted to have a meeting, we participated in that meeting. We listened to all voices and because of the great participation we received from the public, we were able to craft a plan that we're all proud of and it wouldnot have been able to happen without that community engagement process. This is the plan from 1977. So this plan represents an outdated approach to development for a few reasons. You'll see on the screen our wetland areas flanking PCH and Second Street were originally and 77 contemplated for development.That's not an approach we would take today. This plan also does not allow for mixed use. And lastly, it wasn't really a plan. It was a collection of rules compiled based on what had been built and what was anticipated to be built.But it wasn't driven by a community vision in the same way that the plan currently in front of you today is, which establishes a a clear route to create spaces that will be enjoyable and beneficial to the community as a whole.So this is the land plan for the item before you this evening. It makes a few major changes. It protects wetland areas and open habitat area. It concentrates the only areas of change on two sites that are already developed today.So what we're talking about is locations where there are existing shopping centers or existing hotel uses that could be reimagined and redeveloped in the future. It allows for mixed use, which is consistent with its setting. And it provides updated standards, context, sensitive design and a pathway to achieving community benefits.Key to this plan is enhancing the wetlands and coastal resources. So we talked about setting aside natural areas for protection in perpetuity, but this plan goes further than that and it does include a wetlands restoration and monitoring fund that future projects will be paying into.And it also includes provisions that every project is built correctly and in deference to its setting adjacent to our wild areas. So what are bird safe treatments? This is something we spent a lot of time on developing during this plan and birth.Safe treatments come down to three big areas glass plants and lights. So it means making sure that birds of all type can tell the difference between open sky and building glass. It means using plants that are appropriate next to our wetland habitat area.And those are California native plants. And this will be one of the most progressive plants in the United States. And in terms of landscaping and it means lighting, it means using lighting that's appropriate that lights the building but not surrounding areas.And it means working together, not just in the design process, but with future residents and businesses to make sure that that light is really limited, especially at night. Lights up for birds. So this plan is really also about creating organic and compelling placemaking as part of development, not just having x square feet of retail or white squarefeet of residential, but really having those places where community happens and allowing for community gathering places and a sense of experience. A sense of place and a sense of pride. This is also about building form and architecture and creating something that is really befitting of Long Beach.This is our entryway into the city for many visitors every day. And it's we don't have our best face forward today, I think would be the best way to describe it. So it's about creating places that are human scale but are exciting and vibrant and invite a positive image for our city.It's also about building orientation. So believe it or not, there is a beautiful waterway behind what you know today as Ralph's and Best Buy. You don't know that because those buildings block the view of the water and turn their back on the water.There is a way to flip that. There is a way to have you corridors to our waterfront and to have a great environment for future residents, current residents and visitors to all enjoy our waterfront, to stop and have a meal, but stay a while, maybe do some shopping, or maybe just come and enjoy the space with yourfamily and meet some new friends. It's also about open space amenities and creating useful open space between these future buildings that will benefit future residents, current residents and visitors. So it's also about including the streetscape. During our outreach process, there are a lot of different adjectives used by the community to describe PCH.Most people did not describe it as beautiful or as the best street in Long Beach or as something they were particularly proud of. So part of this plan is really about changing that engagement between the built environment and the street and having buildings that have interesting and exciting edges with the street.It's also about increasing connectivity. We know that we are a city of cars and many folks will continue to drive. But it's also about giving people other choices, including biking and walking and improving the environment for all forms of mobility.To that end, this project increases bicycle lane miles in the area by 79%, 29% increase in pedestrian facilities and a 9% increase in roadways for cars. This just gives you an idea of the reimagining of PCH. So this shot here is sort of approaching the Marina Pacifica shopping center today.So imagine separated bike lanes where you feel safe, new planting medians, trees and somewhere that you're not just comfortable, but somewhere that you want to return to because you have a positive experience in terms of positive, increased connectivity.The most common concern about the project was about the traffic at Second and PCH. There's some things that we can do, but there are limits to what we can do about traffic. So one of the ideas we're doing in this plan is breaking up the super blocks and making sure that if you don't have to go throughthat intersection, you don't have to go through that intersection, that you can get around different sites and that you have an internal street grid instead of the giant super blocks that you see out there today. So if I'm a resident in Naples and I'm trying to get where Ralph says today, there's no need for me to gothrough that second and PCH intersection. Once we have a better functioning internal street grid and I can get through the different sites without going through that major intersection. So I was asked to keep it brief. But just in summary, I think what we've done with this plan is really try to accomplish a community goal.We did that through coming up with development standards that were sufficient to attract private investment and create all these amenities and improvements that we talked about, but are also scaled appropriate to their setting and this unique location near the water and near our great wild areas.So that concludes the staff presentation and we're available here at the staff table for all your questions. Okay. Now, of course, this is a a hearing. So the way this works is the city has made a presentation. There is an.Appellant We have one. Appellant Correct me if I'm wrong is Mr. City Attorney. So the one appellant has asked for 15 minutes, so we will do 15 minutes for the one. Appellant And is he just come on down?And we will also I know that the appellant has also asked for rebuttal time. So what we'll do is if there is additional comments after this by staff, then we'll grant the rebuttal time. If there's not, then there's obviously no need for the rebuttal time if there isn't any additional comments.Sounds good. Okay, let's go ahead. And, Madam Clerk, you'll have the time.Thank so much, honorable mayor and City Council for having us here today. My name is Warren Lisowski. I'm the president of Long Beach, Citizens for Fair Development. Mr. Salisbury, we're taking notes. I'm actually the president of the organization.I'd like to start out today to thank staff for their presentation and just point out a couple of issues that I don't have the agenda in front of me. So City Council and Honorable Mayor, I ask you to look at each of these decisions that are being made individually.Very often decisions come before you and there are many items that are grouped together. So let's just break down exactly what's happening today. The staff is proposing that you repeal and replace the existing PD one set up. It is our position that, yes, leadership is inadequate due to the age.But see, this does have vital protections for the wetlands. And so instead of repealing and replacing c dep CDEP could have been updated in such a way to protect the wetlands better. Just a couple comments directly related to the staff's report.If you remember when we did study sessions in these chambers, the members of the public commented that whatever happened at those community meetings was not accurately reflected in the document. So I just let the record to be clear that the citizens feel that what happened at those study sessions is not in the documents.I've given you each a letter, a three page letter outlining some of the problems. What we've got here is we can't look at just this as a zoning change we have, and we must look at the totality of what's going on in the southeast area.Let's remember that a brand new gas fired power plant was just approved by S.C. The planning commission here has approved three seven story buildings filled with 90,000 gallons of lithium ion battery, the same stuff that was in the note five when you couldn't bring a milliliter of it on the airplane.They want to put 90,000 gallons of it on the wetlands with no additional fire resource and also with no environmental review. The Planning Commission simply approved a mitigated negative declaration for the Battery Tower. If this if this if you vote yes on all of this today, what we are going to end up with is not what?Not wetlands protection. There is going to be 80 foot buildings if a hotel mixed use is used under the plan. The biology in this environmental impact report is woefully inadequate. It does not talk about how the biological resources will be preserved in light of these 80 story buildings.I would like to draw your attention back to the local coastal planning program. The local coastal program was adopted after set up in 1980 as under the California Coastal Act and. The the local coastal plan says that the conservation goals and policies of the Coastal Act should be are there for the preservation of all those through thosewetlands. The local coastal plan also describes CDEP and the accompanying resource management plan as being inextricably intertwined. And so really the way these documents are written, the local coastal plan, sea depth and the resource management plan, they really cannot be extracted from one another.So if you are repealing PD one side, if you're also repealing those portions of the local coastal plan and the resource management plan included within. A couple other problems. As the low Cerritos Wetlands Trust pointed out in their letter from their attorney, Michelle Black, The Post reads, This plan is inconsistent with the general plan.Why? Why is this body spending time to update a specific plan when we know that the general plan does not conform to state guidelines? So wouldn't it make more sense to update the general plan first and then update the specific plans to be in line with that?Also, there's a new government code section 60 50302 that stems from Senate Bill 1000. It's the environmental justice piece of general plans. Now, staff at a earlier meeting stated that these new elements that are being passed have paid some type of service to the Environmental Justice under Senate Bill 1000 with the people of Long Beach wants.What the environmentalists want is we want what the state Senate voted for us and what the governor signed into law. We want an environmental justice element, not just environmental justice, to be dealt with from time to time in the different elements of the general plan.Let's talk about the certification of the final air today. California Environmental Quality Act secure its its California's broadest environmental law and secure it gives the fullest protection of the environment within reason, the fullest protection. This plan does not give the force protection.This is a development plan. This is an oil drilling plan. Even though the misnamed Wetlands Restoration Program, which more aptly should be named the 50 year oil drilling in the wetlands program, is not in front of you today.That land exchange or oil drilling plan cannot happen without this CDEP being repealed. So I'd like you to take a second to think about the gravity of what you're doing today. You've got an environmental protection on our last remaining wetlands, and Long Beach staff is asking you to remove those protections and replace them with a development planallowing 80 foot tall hotels in the buffer areas around the wetlands. The California Coastal Commission sent a letter from a scientist named Kate Kate Hochul Bridge regarding the wetlands, oil consolidation and Restoration Project. And she's got 32 pages from the Coastal Commission about about the problems with these plans.So let's not forget that this sea dep and this oil drilling are one in the same. Let's go back to the local coastal plan that was adopted in 1980. The local coastal plan states that the city shall ask the Coastal Commission for aid and funding to effect the determination of the location and boundaries of the wetlands andtheir buffer areas for restoration. IT when we were here about the pool, the Belmont Pool Project, the attitude of this body and the staff was, let's ask for the biggest project we can and then let Coastal Commission trim it down.I remember Councilman Iran, I didn't think that was maybe the best idea. Coastal Commission staff is right here in downtown Long Beach. Your staff can meet with Coastal Commission. You can form these policies together. You don't have to ask for something that's outsized, that's damaging to the environment.And then have Coastal Commission object to it. This can be this can happen in a more collaborative setting. Another way that the air is inadequate is there's something called the Low Cerritos Channel Watershed Group. It's made up of the cities of Bellflower, Cerritos, Downey, Lakewood, Long Beach, Paramount and Signal Hill and the L.A. County Flood District.There's a watershed management program. This document in the jurisdiction section of the air did not come up at all. That's just one reason why the air is inadequate. I wanted to respond to a couple more of staff's points.There was a beautiful slide called Placemaking. I went to high school in Long Beach. Placemaking was not a word. Okay. That's a made up word by the consultant. I think they've got place in the name of their business.That's the same consultant that's doing the Dewey Plan that brought 60 people here to object to it. So our recommendation is stop using place works. They don't. They do not. Their values and the residents of Long Beach values are do not resonate with each other.Environmentalists and community activists. We don't want place works here in Long Beach. One more thing is staff had a beautiful slide called building orientation, talking about the the underused backside portion facing the Marina Pacifica condos from Best Buy and Ralphs.Some beautiful pictures there. They've got sailboats sailing down the channel there. It makes me think that these consultants have never even been there before because everyone knows you can't have a sailboat sailing down between Marina Pacifica condos and Best Buy.So if they have spent time there. Once again, I do not think they have an understanding of how the southeast area of Long Beach operates. Couple other points here, because I do want to save a few minutes. Let's think about where we are in the world right now.Let's think about what's happened the last few months. Let's look at the horrible hurricane in Houston. I mean, Houston, we all heard it on the news. We all heard it from the commentary. Unchecked development was the cause of a lot of that flooding, unchecked development in Houston.The developers were allowed to build wherever they want, and that ended up with freeways being below sea level. And that led to the death and destruction on top of what was already a horrible natural disaster. Let's think about what's in that water that those people had to wade through.That was the biggest oil production facility in the world there on the Texas coast. And now it's become a toxic soup that those people are going to have to live with for the rest of their lives. We have yet to see the spike in cancer, the spike in miscarriage.We don't know what the health effects are going to be. Now, let's look at the low street, those wetlands that are going to be unprotected if you pass this law tonight. We know sea level rise is imminent. We know there's an earthquake fault running across the wetlands between the oil production facilities.All it takes is a small tsunami. It could be a couple of feet tall. All it could take is a couple of feet of storm surge. And all those oil operations and all that residential area. And your beautiful pictures of PCH will be covered in the same toxic soup that's covering Houston right now.We demand that that does not happen. We beg of you to not pass this resolution. There's a couple of other things regarding development. I know staff really wants to put these tall, mixed use buildings in the L.A. Times yesterday.Downtown Los Angeles has a 20% residential vacancy rate. People can't pay 30 $500 for a one bedroom apartment. Something else that's lacking with this E.R. and why it should not be certified is the cumulative impacts are lacking. This body's proposing to certify a specific plan.Er it's a programmatic element. That Environment Impact Report does not mention the Battery Towers. It does not mention the battery plans. It does not mention the land swap. So California's Sequoia insists that the cumulative impacts of any environmental projects be recognized.And finally, this. This area falls under the Clean Water Act. These are waters of America. And even though our current administration wants to redefine the waters of America to a more narrow definition, this body should stand up and protect the waters of America.And finally, what do we want? We want you to delay this vote. This body has broad powers to change the land use via the general plan zones and the specific zoning zones. So what we're asking you to do is to start to break long beaches, addiction to oil and fossil fuels.California has set a 2040 zero emissions goal. How does a 50 year oil drilling plan in step help a zero emissions goal? Let's follow some of the leaders. When the president said that the people of Pittsburgh didn't vote for Paris, that the people of Pittsburgh voted for him, the Pittsburgh mayor came back and said, no, we didn'tvote for that. And in fact, Pittsburgh has a zero emission goal by 2030. Companies like Volvo are going to stop making combustion engines. So Long Beach is progressive in many ways. This body is progressive in many ways. And we strongly encourage you to be progressive in your thought for the southeast area and preserve the wetlands that wehave. If I could reserve the last minute. I appreciate it, Mr. Mayor.And so I'm asking you reserving the last minute for rebuttal or for that?I could have 5 minutes.Yeah. Those are some things you can reserve for your other minute. If you want to finish the last minute.I'll just reserve whatever time for rebuttal you would be.So. Okay. So you're going to get 5 minutes for rebuttal. Thank you. Okay, then we're going to turn this back over to two staff and guys. Guys. So let me let's just try to get through the hearing as expeditiously as possible.So we're gonna turn over to staff and then after staff does any additional comments, then, Mr. Foss, you have a chance to do a rebuttal, and then we'll do we'll go to the public and of course, the deliberations of the Council.So. Mr. Motorcar.Mr. Bullock, Ms.. Burdick will give a short rebuttal.Actually, I'm going.To ask Christopher to start, but I just do want to make one correction. For the record, the appellant said 80 stories.I think I would ask the appellant to.Agree that he really meant 80 feet.Thank you.I could even council members. So the majority of what you heard is addressed in their written record in the staff report in front of you. I draw your particular attention to the resolution in front of you. Certifying the E.R. includes findings of fact that address the adequacy of the document.I do want to talk about the speaker referenced several related projects in the area and a number of years ago. So over three years ago, when we embarked on this process, the city council at that time declined to do any type of moratorium or interim controls while we were preparing this plan.So, staff, the city has a legal obligation to process applications as they come in based on the laws that are on the books at the time. So the appellant referenced a CC power plant which is replacing existing power plant with a cleaner one that not a city project that's under the jurisdiction of the Energy Commission.He referenced the a battery storage facility that was approved by the Planning Commission by Mr. Pisarski. His appeal on that separate project is pending at this time. He referenced the Beach Oil Minerals Partner Project, which Mr. Boesky objected that project in writing during the E.R. but that project has not yet come to hearing.So beyond that, placemaking is a defined term. There's a whole document about it from the Project for Public Spaces. If people are interested in not all of the projects, most mentioned by Mr. Lisowski are accounted for in the cumulative analysis of the document.So beyond that, I want to be deferential to the Council's time and we can dove into any of the issues that were brought up. But they are all addressed in your written materials, particularly in those squat findings that are attached to the air certification resolution prepared by the city attorney.Thank you. We're going to have the the appellant please can do. Rebuttal.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Mr. Koonce with response with regards to the California Energy Commission's approval and jurisdiction of the new power plant. Yes, the city does not have jurisdiction, but the city does have zoning and general plan control.What does that mean? The city could have entered into the S.E.C. process with a generating station as an intervenor. The city could have done what was best for the people of Long Beach and intervened and said, Why do we need another 500 megawatt fossil fuel generating station on our wetlands?So that brings us to yes, there are all these other projects, but let's talk about what this council can do with zoning. I'm going to throw a couple of ideas out here. One of the ideas is. When this new oil drilling plan comes into effect.I know it's still up in the air, but in all likelihood it's going to be approved. You could add to the zone that any oil drilling, any injection waste, any water injection or chemical injections that those oil developers have to provide a list of all the chemicals that are being injected into the ground.That's a very simple change. As you know, the petroleum industry wants to keep those thousands of chemicals as proprietary. And so under Prop 65, we don't even know what carcinogens are in there. There are all kinds of different benzene and crazy aromatic rings that are carcinogenic.And then finally, with regards to the specific zoning and the general plan, there are guidelines that the state gives you and there are things that are out of your jurisdiction. But this city council, this body, is given the power of zoning, and that's a very powerful tool.And so when you say that the battery tower hasn't been approved, but it's going to go on the wetlands, you could tonight simply add a piece to this new cap that says we don't allow over one gallon or 89,000 gallons of lithium ion flash flammable fluid to be on the wetlands.So that is the control you have. One final thought about Mr. Koons and the staff's idea of the inevitability of land use. Yes, certain land uses are by right. We understand that. But the way that staff has often positioned that in front of the council and the planning commission is that the commission and the council must extendthose land uses by rights to other decisions that are not by right. For example, I'm going to bring in an outside example just to make this point and then I'll wrap up. 320 Alamitos Street What came up before Planning Commission?They were asking for a building with residential units and it was also on two lots. And staff told the Planning Commission that you have to approve this project because it's buy right for them to build those many units.You can't change the downtown plan parking ratios without changing the downtown plan. What they failed to let the commission know was that they did not have to buy right approved the lot merger and if they would have simply not approved the Lot merger, then that development could have been squelched.So don't let staff pull your power out from under you. There are things that you can do to make a difference. You can give landowners their rights and at the same time do what's right for the city of Long Beach and for our wetlands.Thanks so much, Mr. Mayor. Appreciate it.Thank you, sir. Okay. We're going to go ahead now and move on to the rest of the hearing. So we've closed both the applicant out, which is the city in this case, of course, the presenter and the appellant and the time for both the presentation.The rebuttal is now closed. We're going to go to public comment only those that, of course, swore in to the oath and those that are here for this item. So if you didn't see the swearing in, please, please come down to the podium and present yourself, of course, your name for the record.And again, just line up on this and we'll get through these comments and then back to the Council for deliberation on the Ccep item. Yes, sir.Good evening, Mayor and City Council. Hi. My name is Bob Paternoster. I'm happy to be here this evening. When I. When I first, I'm going to give you just a little historical context for this project. When I moved to Long Beach in 1977, my first important job as director of planning and building was to try to bringclosure to the city planning process. The Planning Commission had already appointed a citizens advisory committee. I was pleased that this evening when I came in here and found that Jan Hall, who was head head of that committee, was president, of course she was later Councilwoman Jan Hall, and that that committee consisted of residents, property owners and developers. That committee had already created a vision for Sea-Tac when I arrived. And that vision was basically that they wanted something like Irvine. I remember back at 1977, Irvine was just blossoming and people were looking at it very fondly.And the committee, like the mix of housing units, they were willing to accept smaller than the standard size lot for residential development if the developer would provide lots of open space, bicycle trails and so forth. But at that time, they were deadlocked because the citizens, even though they knew what they wanted, they did not trust the cityto implement that. They did not trust the city to force developers to build that open space in those and those and those. Trails and so forth, because plain old zoning R1, R3 just doesn't do that. And the one small contribution that I think I made to the process was to tell them that there are other land usecontrols that you can use besides standard zoning. For instance, a plan development district. And once they realize that that the the law could require developers to build open space, to build the trails, the bike trails and so forth.Then the plan was forward to city council adopted and you had PD one, the first plan development district in the city. Now the plan, the city plan did focus on the area north of the luxury trust channel and residential development because that was where the vacant land was.And since the time of adoption, we've had the construction of a Bixby village with the golf course of the Largo, with Simms Pond of Bay Harbor, Spinnaker Bay, Spinnaker, coves with a new waterfront development not only for a boat boat docks, but also a continuous public walkway along all of that waterfront throughout there.And all of these villages tied together by the city's first class one bike path through residential areas. The wetland was recognized and preserved now after adoption of the plan. It was expanded when we went through the LCP, but it was preserved, as was the the Pacific Flyway.There was little concern, quite frankly, for affordability of housing at the time, although we did preserve the the mobile home park and apartments were mixed in with single family residential. But you have to realize what the attitude of the city was back in 1977.At that time. Young, upwardly mobile family.Thank you. Sorry. Time is up. Oh, I know. Sorry about that.All right. Let me just end by saying I encourage I encourage you to move forward with adopting the plan. It's been 40 years and it's about time.Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please. Yeah, we've got to watch the time, especially tonight, because we have a lot of items from SL.Watch the time. Even though I don't like it's so short. My name is Jan Hollings, former city councilwoman for the third district in the city of Long Beach, and, as Bob indicated, chair of the original city of committee.I'm here to say that I am opposed to the proposed changes to see death for very specific reasons. There's a lot of good in that plan that's being proposed, but the things that can't seem to be taken care of, in my opinion.Our number one traffic. The city of Long Beach and this end of town are going to be inundated by lots of changes in the traffic without any development. The widening of the four or five freeway in Orange County is going to bring a tremendous increase again on Seventh Street in the Long Beach area.Four lanes of new traffic and it stops at seventh Street. Those cars are going to go somewhere and they are going to impact the Cedar Area and by extension, the areas in the third district. The concern I have about the density is one that is merely an observation that currently there is not a complete build out ofdensity that's currently allowed in the city plan. I think we're pushing our luck if we keep adding more people without some kind of traffic solutions. Number three, the idea of the height limits currently the height limit is is three stories, as you all know, and is being proposed to be 5 to 7 stories.I think that that kind of height will really create a very different. The situation on Pacific Coast Highway then is in being envisioned by the planning department and the consultants. And by that I mean is that if you have five and seven story buildings along Pacific Coast Highway, effectively from Lloyd's Drive to the SEAL Beach border, youreally are creating a barrier along that whole stretch of land. I know there'll be some adjustments to build it back, but I am concerned that that barrier will change the entire atmosphere in the third district and kind of undo what basically has been created in the third district.And so with those for those reasons and several others, I just would like to issue my propose my opposition to this proposal. And thanks, Suzy Pryce as the councilwoman. It's a tough decision and it isn't going to be easy no matter what.Thank you.Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Mayor and City Councilmember. My name is Randy Gordon.I am president and CEO of Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce. On behalf of the Chamber and our leadership, we strongly support, she said, which all of you know is a huge opportunity for Long Beach, not just from a business perspective, but so many.Other ways as well. The plan will allow for mixed use projects with.Residential, retail, commercial and hotels. This will create thousands of new construction jobs related jobs over the course of the next 10 to 15 years. It will attract a new high end retail, which will create thousands of jobs for residents and most importantly, will keep sales tax revenue in Long Beach that now migrates to south to Orange County. We see the opportunity for.Incredible economic synergism with Long Beach State, the retail, residential communities in Naples and Belmont Shore and all other communities throughout the city. And as far as potential projects as they come online, we absolutely believe this will assist the east side of Long Beach to start driving sales tax.Dollars north to our city.From SEAL Beach, Huntington Beach and other nearby areas. It will.Create a beautiful gateway that our city.Desperately needs and deserves to welcome visitors from our communities and will help all of us who are working to promote Long Beach as a great place to bring your business. Also included in the plan, it's a benefit to the environment.It provides funding through development fees and other grants to improve the current declining wetlands. Lastly, and probably the biggest impact to the city and the reasons enough to pass this tonight, it will create millions of dollars annually to the city through sales tax and property tax revenue.As a.Resident.Just down.The street in Bay Harbor, I am absolutely convinced this is the right thing to do at the right time. And our members and our leadership. We urge you to vote for this proposal.Thank you for allowing these comments to be in the record. Thank you. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.Good evening, mayor and city council members.My name is Sarah Wilkes Fong and I am here on behalf of the Los Angeles County Business Federation. Base Fed is a massive, diverse grassroots alliance of 165 business organizations, with over 325,000 employers.With over 3 million employees throughout Los Angeles County.That advocates for policies and projects that strengthen our regional economy. We are in strong support of the adoption of the Southeast Area Specific Plan.A comprehensive and thoughtful, thoughtful blueprint to guide future development. See, RCEP will not only enhance the area quality of life for Long Beach residents, but also gives the business community the ability incentive.To reinvest in the area.New mixed land designation designations, updated design guidelines and infrastructure improvements will give property owners the flexibility to create new residential, commercial and employment opportunities that fit the vision of the city. This update.Helps to replace.Outdated plan planning with a specific plan that will balance sustainability, economic development and livability.We appreciate the city staff's.Dedication to bring forward this detailed plan, and we urge the city council.To adopt it. Thank you for your consideration.Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.Good evening, Mayor and City Council.My name is Bill Thomas. I'm a resident of the Alamitos Heights and past president.Of Elm Estates Association, which is adjacent to the property.Area under.Discussion. I was also involved quite a few years ago when Councilman DeLong was brought the initial study proposal up, and it didn't make any progress. I'm speaking today as a member of the advisory committee. That is off the record.I believe the record will show over attended all of the advisory committee meetings, a very large number of the city, the community gathering meetings. And I must compliment the staff and the Place Works group that have done a magnificent job of hearing.All kinds of suggestions and reaching out to every conceivable interest. And I would.Just quite amazed at how well that progress went. And I'm very much in price in favor of the project that looks out 50 years, not back 50 years, and what.The city can expect from its citizens and from.Its businesses in the area to make a better place for all citizens to live, work and enjoy the great aspects of the city of Long Beach and strongly endorse you or request your positive endorsement of the project. Thank you very.Much. Thank you very much, sir. Next speaker, please.Good evening. And Cantrell and I am a member of Carp, which is citizens about responsible planning. Although not mentioned by the staff, the Planning Commission has recommended the reduced intensity alternative and reduction in height on the marketplace parcel.Even this is not enough. I urge the Council to choose the No project slash CDP alternative. If you reject this, at least reduce the duced intensity of alternative to one story buildings on all in the within 300 feet of the wetlands and require three storey buildings in the rest of the area and take any new oil developmentout of this plan. I have worked to change CDEP for 20 years because of two threats extending Studebaker Road through the wetlands and allowing homes on the wetlands. This has been eliminated with this plan, but what we've gotten with C CIP is many times worse.Over 5400 additional residential units, five story buildings on property surrounding the wetlands, extension of Shop Keeper Road through the wetlands, seven story hotels. And they say the significant, unavoidable impacts are going to occur in air quality cultural resources, greenhouse gas, emission, noise, transportation and traffic.That means nothing's going to be done. About those 5 to 7 story buildings are a menace for birds. Bird safe glass is being required on only 90% of the buildings. It should be on everyone. The FDA, the FBI are future further states that only the areas facing the wetlands will receive bird safe treatment.In other words, birds flying out of the wetlands will be protected. Those flying into the wetlands will be striking 60 to 80 foot buildings with untreated gap glass. Another danger to wetland wildlife was not mentioned in this air.And it goes with new dwelling units right next to the wetlands. With that comes domestic pets.Not don't.Not all owners keep their dogs and cats inside or on leash. Even one dog or cat can be devastating to breeding success of many of the ground nesting birds. The California Coastal Act requires public access to the coast and restricts what development is allowed in coastal areas.Coastal lighted buildings are allowed. Residential is not.Thank you very much, Nick Speaker.I will I will give you the rest of my comments.Thank you, Miss Cantrell. Next speaker, please.Good evening, Mayor and distinguished counsel. People, you all look very, very, very nice tonight. Very distinguished. Thank you. Thank you. My name is Ricardo Perdomo, and I'm a local business person. I've had the pleasure of living in the island, Naples Island, for about 15 years now.And it's just a great, great neighborhood. And I mean, I just love Long Beach when people ask me, where do you live? I say, I live in Long Beach, and they're like, Why the heck do you want to live in Long Beach?Well, obviously we don't know what communities we have and everything that the City of Long Beach has to offer. That being said, I want to thank everybody here on the panel for all your hard work in making the city a much greater place to live.Thank you. And I'm also here in in April, the actual project. We really want to see something different in our community. We really believe in speaking with many of my neighbors and many of the people that live here in Long Beach.They're just really, really tired of actually going through that community, that part of our community, that that part of our city and just seeing what is there now. My city has so much to offer and people don't know about it.So this could actually be really one of the huge focus points entryway that can really showcase our city. The project is going to help. Attracting people to our city, is going to have new families, young professionals and just really, really showcase our city.I also appreciate the fact that this also has written in the plan where it's going to actually help preserve and restore the wetlands. Thank you guys very much as well for pushing the bike paths and the walk and the walking paths.That's a really great thing to have and this project is also going to help. I actually having those those incorporated into their into their project. That's one of the big selling points that sells our city as a forward thinking city.Help us make the city shine. Approve this project. Thank you very much. I encourage you say yes on this project. Thank you.Thank you. And before we go to the next speaker, we do have folks in line. Obviously, a lot of public comment as well as outside for this item. So we're going down to 2 minutes unless there's any objection from the council.If there's an objection, we'll go back to three C. No objection. Madam Clerk, we're going out of 2 minutes. Go ahead.Hi. My name is Susan Phillips. I live at 6125 East Ocean Boulevard. I'm not particularly opposed to this project, but I'm opposed to some of the parts of this project. I feel that if we're going to say 3 to 5 stories and then it says a little caveat down at the bottom seven storeys with an okay bya committee, I'd like to know which committee it is like. Is it you? Is it the city manager's office? Is it the developers? Is it the planning commission? I think if we're going to say 3 to 5 storeys, we should say 3 to 5 storeys, period.I think we should have some rules about it. Long Beach has always been a city of neighborhoods, and I hope that whatever we're doing, we don't just develop. The city is called us now an urban area. And I hope that within the planning that we're choosing to do, we can maintain the independence of our neighborhoods.It's really important to the beauty of Long Beach, and we all live here because we love our neighborhoods. And the last thing I like to say is just about this process, just in case, you know, the pit, the pictures that you saw up there when they were showing the open area, the first part that look really pretty, those were two storey buildings. I don't know if anybody noticed that about that area. So we're kind of being manipulated here, I feel, because when I went to the Planning Commission meeting, they talked about Bella Terra. So I went out and saw Bella Terra and it's an asphalt jungle.And so I just want you to think about the fact of what we're picking and what we're choosing. That's all. Thank you so much.Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.Good evening, honorable mayor. Members of the city council. My name is Jeff Hoffman. I'm a lifelong resident of Long Beach, living in Naples, less than a mile from the intersection of Second and PCH il. The city is going in such a great direction.We see what's been happening uptown with some of the new development up there we've been seeing. What's been happening downtown, I mean, is evident. All the great things that are happening when we drive around here and we we want that for our east side gateway is well, if this has been a really good process over the pastfew years, we've attended the workshops. We've had an opportunity to sit around the table with people who who disagree with us, but that are still neighbors like the person who spoke just before me. So I think it's been a great process, but it's also a really good plan.I think the consultants, I think city staff from the Planning Department have done a really good job taking in all of the input from various points of view. You know, I don't think it's a perfect plan. There's things that I would love in it, but there's people in this room that would absolutely hate the things that Iwould have loved. So I think it's a good compromise and is a wonderful opportunity for us to move forward and have some really good development while restoring the wetlands. So I encourage you all to vote for the city plan.Thank you.Thank you for the testimony. Next speaker, please.Very good. You. I've been following this since Gary too long. Wanted to build a 70 story tower with a flea market on every corner. One of the. And also, let me start with the one thing I was glad somebody pointed out.I've never pointed out before, but it's inane when they show the picture of a sailboat down in the channel behind BestBuy and reading Pacifica, obviously, and then a sailor they'd never heard of being in irons. You can't sell their period.What was intriguing and interesting is the cut through in terms of and I've often thought about this and I'm sure other people have and I hope they put that in there, is that they can put a cut through.So when you come down the aisle, you're able to cut through the Marina Pacifica behind a behind Albertson's, behind a whatever they are, Gelson's and zip across without having to go through the intersection. The intersection itself raises the point of something I really think should be done before we move forward, and that is study the concept ofa traffic circle, just like we have at where our traffic circle is. They're used all around the world. I know some people don't like them. There's some people that don't like to cross that bridge of the what these speakers pointed out last week, they were at the last planning commission meeting that has a business on Second Streetthat quite frankly, during the week there will be not that much business period in the restaurants, the foot, the floors, the businesses on the second floor, nicely designed or simply not have that traffic certainly during the week. I am troubled and I don't I don't know the answer relative to solving all the environmental issues, but I challengethis council to come up with the best possible solution so we don't destroy it. Thank you. The environment.Thank you for your time.Next speaker, please. My name is Michael Fields. I live at 6171, Laguna Hart Court in Bay Harbor. And we are live behind a community business area called Marina Plaza, which I request that you look at the map on page four.It's a little triangle in the center of the plan here, and it allows for a 3 to 5 story remaking of that particular project. And it makes no sense in that little tiny space, right, right behind our community to go up 3 to 5 stories if they want to put a hotel there.And it goes up to seven stories. Look how tiny that little that little spot is there. And what I read, though, the zoning requirements there was an exception for the in and out burger at one story. I don't know why there's one story, not burger.And this little small community here runs up from if they remake it 3 to 5 stories doesn't make sense. It's just going to be a congested area. It's not going to be favorable to the people in the neighborhood.And I request that you remake that zoning requirement of three or four, 3 to 5 stories and a limited to one story only. Thank you.Thank you for your testimony. Next speaker, please.Good evening, City Council. My name is Gordon and I live in the third district. I'm here to ask you to seriously consider the alternatives that have been proposed to you this evening regarding less density, less traffic, and less height.On this plan, I'm opposed to it because I believe firmly that this is a development plan and not a plan for the protection of wetlands. I'm here to tell you, I was here at City Hall the evening that this grant was announced by our city staff.I was delighted to hear that the city would get resources in order to do something about this plan. I'm equally dismayed to stand up here tonight and tell you that the process was flawed. Those community meetings were held.There were 200 people who attended over the course of time. Where were the hundreds and thousands of people who should have been participating in this process? Vice Mayor Richardson, did any of these meetings happen in your district? Councilman, you were on.Did any of these meetings happen in your district? Do you ever drive to the second and PCH intersection? Do you think this should have been discussed outside of the third district? I'm an advocate for process. This process was flawed.This project is flawed. It is too high. It is too dense. There's too much traffic. There's not enough mitigation for those valuable wetlands that need to be restored in the third district of Long Beach. And I ask that you seriously consider alternatives.Thank you.Thank you for your testimony. Next speaker, please.My name is Deena Dach. I have lived in this community for approximately 50 years. I'm a California certified naturalist for the state. I am also. This last year, I've been honored to be the national education director for NMDA, and I am saddened by what we look at.Ed in this community. In Huntington Beach, it took 25 years for them to salvage and save the wetlands. You probably all notice it as you drive down Pacific Coast Highway. You probably all notice that people are using it for educational value.That they take a look at it and say, Isn't.It great that we have 3% of what was once 100% of the wetlands here in California, in the community where we can make a difference is here, Long Beach, we can look at our wetlands and we can see whether or not.There's a possibility that we could control ourselves and stay to the three story level. Four years ago, I worked on a management group to take a look at the animals that were flying over the wetlands area and across PCH.And on to the Long Beach Marina area. Many of those trees have been cut. 58 of the trees have been taken out in this particular community. So we don't have some of the birds that we once had. I realize I only have 30 seconds to make a difference, but you can make a difference as a member ofthis council.And look at it and see.That down the road. What you do tonight.In your decision makes a difference in our children's lives, in the community lives. And it's not all about money.It's about saving enough environment, space that it is functional for this community.Thank you for your time. Ask you to do so.Thank you. Next speaker bruce. Good evening, vice mayor and.Members of the council. I'm Jeff miller. I live in long beach. I urge you to reject Sea CIP as it is currently proposed. Why? Because it would allow new buildings to be too tall. Increased height above the currently allowed 35 feet would be detrimental to the city.Proposed changes could lead to our stretch of PCH looking like Lincoln Boulevard and Marina del Rey. Another concrete canyon. Increased traffic resulting from increased density would negatively affect city residents and workers. The traffic itself, of course, but also decreased air quality despite the claims by city staff.This plan is not supported by the majority of Long Beach residents. This false claim has been stated so often that maybe you believe it. The Sea Subcommittee was not representative of residents. The committee meetings did not provide for adequate public involvement and comment.Additional community meetings were not designed. For adequate public input. The wishes of the majority of the residents of the city are being ignored. The CCP should reflect the will of the residents of the city. These half a million people are your constituents, not a dozen commercial property owners and investors along a one mile stretch of PCH.Your allegiance belongs to the residents and businesses throughout the city who would be harmed by this plan. You do not owe allegiance to a dozen developers who would change the character of this vital area of the city. The current construction plan for the old Seaport Marina Hotel property shows that development and profit is possible within the 35foot height limit. I ask that you maintain this limit for the good of the city now and.Long into the future. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Hello. I'm Richard Roth. I live in the Long Beach and District three, and I can basically support what the previous speaker just said and the appellant as well. We have this thing has has just has to be smaller.And one thing that I'm not sure was brought up. If today Mexico City or the Mexico City area had a huge earthquake, if we had a and we're going to have a similar event here. And if you're in the area around, well, all of the third district, you're going to be trapped.So we have a serious safety issue that we're ignoring. And I don't think I need to say anymore. Thank you.Thank you for your time. Next speaker, please.Before you before you start my time. Can I tell you.That I've gotten so many texts from people who cannot hear, who are in the overflow room and they said there's no one to be found that can help fix their audio.Okay. Well, I think that's.The right thing to do, given there's so many people.Interested in this.Issue. Right. This your city manager? Can we check that out? Thank you so much.So can we take.Sure. Let's start your time. Right.Thank you so much. So my name is Elizabeth LAMB. I'm executive director of the Low Street Wetlands Land Trust. Before I say anything else with my brief 2 minutes, I want to thank city staff and thank our council member for the ability to dialog with them and share with them our views.It means a lot to us.As you know, we are devoted to protecting and restoring flows through this wetlands. So it's a great community resource, not just for local residents, but for everyone who.Lives in Long Beach. Therefore, we need a plan for the Sea Superior that provides the right.Balance of conservation and development consistent with the community context and vision. With that in mind, why we understand that you.Feel pressure to conclude this.We do want to remind you that the general plan.Process provides a second opportunity to revisit, see an amended if warranted.So let me.Quickly summarize.The final few modifications that we.Urge you to include that we.Sent in our final comment letter. Factually, very few.Acres of the Sea Superior.Are in play here for redevelopment. Actually, less than the 85 acres that was first identified as areas of change because of the fact that second and PCH is moving forward, internal road surface parking.But even that small remaining part that remains will.Have a huge impact to the community.And the wetlands develop depending on how it's.Developed. So we support further density.Further reduced density in the form of an interim baseline density that could be revisited later.We support.100,000 square feet of new commercial development, which would bring the total up to 2,000,191 476.Square feet.We support 1000 new units, dwelling units for a total of 5070 units and redevelopment of the existing hotel rooms. As my time winds out, I want to tell you that we've put all of these in a specific comment letter to you.And to really emphasize the point that we're not saying don't do anything. We're saying do something that's reasonable and balanced and protects an important resource.Thank you for your time. Thank you. Next speaker, please.Good evening. Council Members.Michelle Black on behalf of.The La Cerritos Wetlands Land Trust. And again, the Land Trust really does appreciate the changes that have been made to see steps to improve the specific plan and add bird and wetlands friendly policies and mitigation. But the city's general plan is now underway, which was not the case when Seaside was initiated.There's now a strong argument that the sea SAP approval should wait until the general plan update is completed. So there's no question that the general plan is current and complete to provide a legally adequate basis for approval. Our letter laid out a path to approve seize up in advance of the general plan update.Now there are some parallel to approving a specific plan in the absence of a legally adequate general plan. And we see that as a really good reason to ensure that CCEP has included all feasible mitigation measures. If the city chooses to adopt CSF now before completion of the General Plan update, we recommend that you adopt a lowerinterim density as a as Elizabeth mentioned and proposed by the Land Trust, and that's detailed in our letter. And this is a baseline density that could be revisited, as Elizabeth said, and modified in the future. After hearing more public comment and after looking at the analysis that will be generated by the general plan update process, remember additionaldevelopment in this environmentally sensitive and traffic constrained area at any density, interim baseline or reduced density will have significant impacts on the wetlands and the community. The mitigation for this must be very, very carefully worded so that it meets its goals of protecting community and environment.So this means that wetland buffers are actually buffers. There's no development.Or recreational activity.Within the buffers themselves. This means that open space is actually open space and not private patios in places the public doesn't know about. And this means that height limits are lower in this sensitive area to protect birds. The inclusion of excellent bird safe measures is laudable, but we're afraid that those gains could be eroded if height limitsare high. And thank you very much. I'm here to answer any questions on my letter.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Good evening. My name's Linda Pemberton, and I'm from Belmont Heights. And. I'm here representing myself as just a neighbor, and I know that I'm in the camp of I would like to see this plan adopted with some change.And I think most of the people that I talked to are very concerned about the height and the density because of the traffic. And as you know, you're talking all over the city with people about the general plan right now.And there's a lot of people who are concerned about the same issues. So I just wanted to bring out bring to your attention that with the reduced plan, it actually represents about 22% of the housing needs that Scaggs is saying that the entire city needs.And I think that's a little high for an area that has going to put all of these almost 56 I mean, 2600 housing units in a little 86 acre space next to a wetlands. And where we have such terrible traffic, I think an increase of 43% in the traffic with probably 18 of our 21 intersections have difficultynow. So while I thank you for putting together this this plan, I would like to see the baseline density option with caps on it put into place so that we can move slowly into the future. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please. Yeah. Hi, I'm Marshall, Dostoevsky. I live in Ocean Boulevard and I'm on the steering committee of the Long Beach Area Peace Network. And I've actually come here for two reasons. One, to support the hotel workers in their fight for justice.But the other thing is, I am representing Lebanon, a Long Beach area peace network. And we're interested in peace and social justice. We're really against this whole plan. We think that it's the whole idea of Caesar was to preserve the wetlands.What this is going to do is isolate the wetlands. It's too big. The project. It blocks the wetlands. We're also concerned about the oil drilling. Why are we concerned about oil drilling?Because global warming.Or climate change is a real issue. And I think that Long Beach is so oil dependent that we are not really thinking about what's going on in the world. We know that climate change has caused part of the Syrian problem, a civil war.There.And so the social justice issue here is why do we want to pollute our environment and add to the climate change as a city? So I think we have a chance to to try to take care of this problem and to make this this project a much smaller and much more workable.Not seven story hotels and everybody's talked about that. The other thing is that I'm a little concerned about was that we kind of lost our right for public comment. We lost a minute. So everyone here is I don't know how many we got.We wrote 30, at least 30 minutes or maybe more. And for the next and hopefully for the next stage of their agendas, the discussion will not be cut off. So thank you very much. Thank you. Next week, a piece.The evening, we're going to see it. And members of the city council I name is Ward Johnson. I live at 436 Bellflower Boulevard and the Blue. The proposed strip mall that's at second. And PCH is yet another failed attempt by the property owner and another developer to put in another quick and dirty fix to get their moneyout so they can. They can. Which means it's a thing where they got in adequate parking and even the developer mentions that there's not enough parking. There are numerous other health food stores and gyms that people can access easier than going to this new site that's being proposed.The proposed com. This proposal completely fails to offer any solution to mitigate the heavy traffic congestion. That is a huge issue here and only going to get worse if this thing is built. What kind of message does a strip mall send send to people coming into our city as an entry point?How can it pass in a year when? These architectural renderings that are being offered show north no parking space and are no space between the buildings for the birds to fly through or people to see the ocean. So is there another proposal that needs to go down?So until they can come up with something?Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. And before we go to the next speaker real quick, I just want to make sure. Are there any folks I know if the fire chief is here that are outside for see SIP and if there are?If there are. I want them. I want them to bring them in. I'm not the face. The fire chief here. Where did he go for a sip. Thank you. So then we are going to cut off the speaker's list and we are going to the lady in the back.Okay. She is out. She will be. Unless there's anyone else receivership. Now's the time. Okay. Okay. So Mr. Barnaby, the last speaker for Ccep and he is going once we're done. See SIP. That is the line. Yes. Please continue.Hi, my name is Marcos. I live in one more district. I know it's not near dip, but it's still part of Long Beach. And I'm here to support to sip see dip c 72. Very confusing. I go to USC, I'm studying urban planning, master's second year.It's planning is such a difficult thing to understand specific plans in particular. So sorry, I don't I'm not good at public speaking, but it's difficult to understand specific plan. So I understand when the public confused and they think that an eight story hotel is going to come in like tomorrow.So I understand also trust the council and I trust the planning commission and I trust the city that you guys are going to. Build something that connects to the wetlands and not just build the store, its story building that's not going to, you know, connect.So I just want to say I support the project, not the project. I support the specific plan. And thank you. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.Good afternoon, counsel. My name's Melinda Cotton. I live in Belmont. Sure. You've heard a lot about density and traffic and height. And the words 60 feet and 80 feet have been used for the five storied seven story buildings.However, I discovered going through the plan today on page 70 of the development standards, there is a notation that says along PCH, architectural features up to an additional ten feet may be approved by the Site Plan Review Committee.So we're talking about even taller buildings than we were earlier. We're also told we will gain amenities through this plan. Those have never been quantified. We don't know how much a developer will be required to donate. We don't know what this will mean in real terms.And most of us would probably agree that the amenities we have now offer fresh air and sky and trees and views of the mountains and wetlands are more important than where these are unknown amenities. And I think an important part of this is that the additional residences we're talking about are market rate.They are not a controlled in any fashion. So they're going to be affordable by the wealthy, by those who can use them for second homes. They will not be affordable for an average Cal State Long Beach graduate or the average worker or family, nor affordable for the low wage workers who desperately need housing.So we're being asked to take on more traffic congestion, more density, more competition for our existing struggling retailers. And they are struggling in Belmont Shore and we will lose the low scale structures and environment that now surround the wetlands.So I hope that you will rethink this and lower the height limits and try to help those who need help.Thank you. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.Hello. My name is Michael James. Kathy. I reside on 1814 Clark Avenue. I was born and raised in Long Beach, California, and I've been adopted into the tongue verification in Canoe Family. Given the name, Halbert means the Seeker.So I want to speak on behalf of the Native Peoples of Long Beach. Performer and I. I see that so much of California's wetlands have been eaten up by increased development. Just inch by inch, by inch, by inch.And I fear that I'm opposed to this to the rezoning of sea, because I just see a further development that is not good for our wetlands and also paving the way for more oil extraction and fracking on a dangerous earthquake fault.The Newport Beach and Inglewood fault line right there and the constructions there are already going under liquefaction where there's constant movement of the land and sinking. And there's just is too complicated. It's very dangerous. And I want to see an improvement in the environment.So I'll just stop there. And I thank you all for listening.Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Mayor and City Council.I'm Robert Fox. I'm the executive director of the Council of Neighborhood Organizations. I'm opposed to this particular plan at the moment. The first reason is the outreach was inadequate, and that was because the database that you all had to use was not updated.We only recently got the current listing of neighborhood organizations to the city about seven months ago. So the process here was flawed. People didn't show up. You had maybe a little over 200 people in the community meetings. That can't be the judgment for this council, not 200 people.Besides which, I have a real problem that the the input from those meetings was not reflected in the staff's report. So I think we need it from now on to have an independent auditor like Laura Dowd do the counting and the metrics on any kind of an evaluation which happens at our our outreach meetings.I'm opposed to this also on a structural basis. We have not made any infrastructure improvement issues on the table at this point in time. And we really need to think about this. It isn't a liquefaction zone. We don't have adequate sewers for the extra development.Eight storeys high next to the wetlands seems absolutely insane to me. I mean, 80 feet I mean, 80 feet tall, I think she said. But I mean, it's sort of like blocks in the Sunshine Law in San Francisco.You can't build a building that blocks out all of your son. So I'm concerned here about the density. I know that parking is horrible and I know the traffic is disastrous going through Second Street, and I'd love to mitigate that.So I will support anything which mitigates things where the quality of life for the citizens of Long Beach is improved. But I don't think that we need. A rush to judgment here because we're just coming up on the land use element.And when that comes up, we can discuss this. Thank you very much for your time.Thank you. Next speaker, please.I have a.Point before my time starts.Next week, a.Piece for Christensen. But the point of order is we're talking to a particular agenda item one Blue Suzuki's appeal. There are several other agenda items under siege. Is there going to be public comment time regarding those?Well, there's one public comment period. Time for the city attorney continue for all items.So this is our only opportunity. This is.The crime.On the all of the agenda.Items on the on the agenda items regarding C zip.Yes, correct. Okay. So now can I start my time, please? What's the point.Of your time is going continue. I will give you the time at the end.Go ahead. Thank you, Robert. I mean, Mayor. So so you should have received this from the Long Beach Area Peace Network. I'm not going to read it again. I might read the summary. What I will read, though, because Ms..Burdick made a point to say that the Veto Our Mineral.Partners project is not part of.This. I will read from the May 5th memo Anybody Own Memo stating that the specific Plan C CIP is designed to be consistent with the beach all mineral partners proposed restoration and consolidation project. She left out, of course, the word oil.This is an oil drilling plan embraced by a rezoning plan. There is no question about it. So I suggest that the elephants in the room, fracking earthquake pipeline breaks and sea rise, all of which the Coastal Commission wrote about and demanded that the Beach Oil Mineral Partners Project address should be at least in the back of yourminds today. Now, what's in the front? It's Hispanic Heritage Day. We had some beautiful music. There's a history here. There's a heritage here. This room is filled with people from Hispanic heritage. What do they want? Sanctuary. Where do they want a safe place to work?Right. We all do. We want to be able to be safe in our employment. And this is this is my hope, peace and social justice, network speaking. We want safety for our workers. We want safety for our darker kids.We want safety for our wildlife. We want safety for the what remains of.Native.American culture in the wetlands. We say leave it in the ground. Leave the 200 million barrels of oil that are folded in to this plant in the ground and the culture and the ground and and get unfortunately, you know, what wildlife doesn't have either.Thank you very much.All in the same boat.Okay. Thank you very much. Our last two speakers.My name is Mary Parcell. I'm here on behalf of El Dorado Audubon Local chapter of the National Audubon Society. This project is very complicated and Bob is included. When you read the sea tip, the sea sip this plan.Now. So it is very, very complicated. Our concerns have always been the wildlife, of course. Shopkeeper, road extension, the footprint of an extended shopkeeper road has a potential to impact existing neighboring wetlands, including jurisdictional wetlands, open space and biological input impacts of the project for analysis of the potential impacts to biological resources that would be created bythe extension of Shopkeeper Road, including surveys for special status plants and animals have the potential to exist in the footprint of this roadway as proposed, so there could be cumulative and unintended problems with this. This is straight out of the California coastal conservancies concerns.We're concerned with birds and native plants. Redwing Road, winged blackbird, a particular species of the marsh, ran song sparrow, common yellow throat, American Kestrel Osprey, Northern Harrier Harrier White Tailed Kite Buildings Savannah Sparrow. What? Run out of my time before I can list all the birds that we love.And I was at an art event over the weekend with people from the fourth and fifth District. And person after person knows about the great blue herons that fly through the buildings. Not over seven stories. I think that's.You got to have some ways for the birds to get through. The great blue herons, the great egrets, the snowy egrets, the black crowned night herons, all of them, just individual people. And that's a representative our of our members that we value this.So thank you very much.Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.Good evening. My name is Michael Bond. I'm a senior principal with Studio 111. We're a group of practicing architects, landscape designers and urban designers with a focus on revitalizing the city. I want to share that we were retained by the Alamo Bay Partnership.We, as Cedar See support was being developed, created a design or a vision for the 90 acres that the Alamitos Bay Partnership owns. We actually took that on the road and shared it with a lot of the community.And we wanted to also thank Susie Price for her interest in understanding the perspective. We were looking at the site. We've heard lots of concerns tonight about traffic and housing, and housing will be significantly less in terms of affecting traffic than any other use proposed on the site.And I wanted to provide some context. Keep in mind, Stony Brook Villas on Bellflower Boulevard, which has 471 units, has all four exits on Bellflower, and I've never seen congestion there. Marina Pacifica has 570 units with only one exit point on Second Street and that I've never seen Congestion, Channel Point Apartments, Pathways and Bixby Village and theVillages on the Green Total 773 units. They all exit on Bixby Village Drive. And I've never seen congestion there. I've lived and I've lived in Council District three for ten years, shop, bike and walk in this area in these areas.I also want to mention Whalers Cove and the Belmont Shores Mobile Homes Estates totaling 395 units, both exiting on loins in the same location or approximate location. And there's no congestion there. Second Street has backups due to Caltrans controlling PCH.Caltrans is focused on moving traffic and moving it fast by either having local control or updating the traffic equipment and synchronizing with our city.We thank you very much.Deeply reduce the amount of traffic that exceeds.Thank you very much.On the cross streets.Okay. Thank you very much. Okay. Thank you very much. That concludes public comment and the public comment portion of the hearing. What we will do is or public comment is closed. We'll go back to the Council for deliberation and for moving forward on the hearing.So first up is Councilwoman Price.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So I'm going to make a few comments and then we'll. There are multiple items associated with this particular hearing. So after hearing from my colleagues, I'd like to go into the specific items and motion those individually.But before I talk about some of the points that were raised during public comment, I do have a couple of questions for city staff. There were some mentions regarding the general plan and the timing of the general plan.And I know the low Cerritos Wetlands Land Trust has expressed some concerns about potential concerns. Between CCF and the General Plan. I've had an opportunity to speak with the City Attorney and Development Services staff about this, but if you could address that, I think that would be educational for everyone.Thank you. Council member. So over here at the staff table, I think we all agree with Ms.. BLOCK and the land trust that the general plan is an important document. That's why the city is investing considerable resources into updating that document.At the same time, we have a disagreement about whether that prohibits this evening's action. From a planning standpoint, the areas of change that we're talking about are and land use district seven, which is a mixed use portion of the general plan.The uses we're talking about this evening are mixed uses. While some aspects of the general plan have aged, we don't find it to be meeting the standard for being inconsistent. Additionally, from a technical standpoint, I might can jump in.As a charter city, we're giving given a certain amount of latitude that other cities that are general law cities are not given. So when we look at the sum of all the factors, there's no reason that we cannot proceed forward tonight.We do believe that the action in front of you is consistent with the existing adopted general plan. We also agree with the comment that it's important to update our general plan, and that's why we're hard at work doing just that and look forward to bringing that item to council in the coming months.Well, and I appreciate that. And later, when I make motions, I do intend to make a motion that's different than the staff's proposal in regards to the general plan. So I do want to hear from my colleagues, but I do believe having some assurance that there will be consistency and no conflict is important.And I want that to be part of the plan before we move forward. So I'll bring that motion, the specific language of my motion. There were some concerns regarding height and as the development services staff and I both know this, the email correspondence and the comments that have come back, some of them have lacked factual accuracy regardingthe height issue. So can you please in regards to the hotel heights, Mr. Koonce, talk about what exactly the height limits will be and under what specific and narrow conditions a developer will be able to build a hotel at this location.And what sites?Sure. So there's as some of the speakers noted, there's a limited number of sites that are actually changing under this specific plan. And then the action in front of you, consistent with what the Planning Commission did, is a reduced intensity alternative.And the other change the Planning Commission did was they reduced height at the marketplace site. So for the marketplace site as well as the Golden Sail site, your height limit is five storeys. So for the other site, which is basically the Marina Pacifica shopping center as well as the properties on the other side, they're on the westside of PCH. So you've got the current Whole Foods location and that Regency Center and some adjacent property. On those limited properties, those two locations. If a hotel wanted to come in, they could, with the permission of the Planning Commission, reach a height of seven storeys on up to 15% on the of the site, and only ifthey included additional extraordinary public benefits beyond what is contained as a base requirement. So that could include a public pocket park that could include a sports or recreational facility that was open to the public. In addition to the hotel guests, it could include a performance venue, but it would have to be an additional public amenity and itwould be limited to the 15% and are limited to those two sites that, in the view of the Planning Commission, was the appropriate compromise.So if I can interrupt you one moment, because I think you're moving into another thought. In addition, one of the other factors that could be considered by the Planning Commission in determining whether or not to allow an application for seven storeys is a provision requiring moderate income and workforce housing.Is that one of the options that's available for someone applying to have seven stories?That could be an additional consideration, but it is limited to buildings that within that building contain a hotel use. And to finish that thought, the reason was brought up by a couple speakers that this is within the coastal zone.And the coastal zone includes all kinds of provisions. And we tend to think about the ones related to wetlands protection and coastal access, but it also includes provisions related to visitor accommodating and visitors serving use of. We as a city have an obligation to provide some type of incentive for possible hotel users in this area.The incentive that was available to us is providing them a little bit more height on a very small portion of it to select sites. And that's what's in front of the city council at this time.So the seven stories we're talking about is limited to two sites and could only be 15% of a total project on those two limited sites.That's correct.And it could only occur with the approval of planning commission, assuming that there are some of the amenities that you just include included in your list that are part of that project.That is correct.Okay.We.Okay. I just want to a few things. This project also creates a wetlands mitigation fund, which in my experience is very unique in terms of development projects and proposals. Can you talk about that a little bit?Sure. So the most recurring common theme that we heard during the outreach process was that the wetlands are very important and we need to find a mechanism not only to not build on them, but to bring them back to do restoration work.And I think all the parties agreed that that's important, but that's also costly. So what we wanted to do was find a way to exact a fee, which in a compliant legal way on new development that would incrementally help pay for the restoration work.So we've got a number of different wetlands out there in the area. There's some that are under private ownership and they would not be eligible for the use of these funds. But we have other wetlands that some are under the city's jurisdiction and some are under the Los Rito Wetlands Authority, which you set on their jurisdiction.And the issue for both those wetlands is a lack of funding to do things like invasive species removal, to correct the tidal flow, to do introduction of correct plant species. So in order to fund that work, what will happen is we will conduct a Nexus study and we will enact this fee in our research.We will be unique, at least here in the in the city, in the of cities in California. But we're confident that it's an important part of this plan because it's what we heard from the public was important. And as we develop that fee, we'll be sitting down with wetlands authority and with wetland stakeholders to make sure thatwe have a proper plan for how those fees are going to be best utilized.Okay. And I will be making an amendment regarding that as well in terms of how we move forward with that fee. But I appreciate the explanation in terms of timing of future developments. You know, I think a lot of times we hear comments about the the the density that's going to happen and the impact that that's goingto have on traffic. Can you shed some light on what the realistic timing of future development is going to be in this seascape area?Sure. So this plan looks out all the way to 2060, but it also looks at tomorrow. So if the city council were to take a positive action this evening, the next step is for this plan to find its way to the California Coastal Commission, and we expect that certification process to take about a year.So after that, there are properties that are less encumbered and might be subject to development in what we in the planning world consider the short term. So in the next five years, for example, there's some possibility that portions of the marketplace could be redeveloped.But there are other properties, such as the Marina Pacifica Shopping Center, that are encumbered by long term leases, including to a grocery store, which typically is a lease that cannot be broken. So that development is 20 years away.So what we're talking about is a plan that's going to suit our needs today, but also well into the future. And in terms of the amount of development that the folks will see in the next five years, it's not zero, but I would describe it as limited.Okay.Thank you. So I want to start off by thanking staff, especially Christopher Coons, for his work on this project. I became involved in this project in 2014, actually, before I took office. And Ms.. Cantrell, I know you sent in an email out with some allegations about my my involvement in this case.And I'd be happy to share with you that I've been involved with this project since before resuming or commencing office, and worked with the city attorney and the PPC to make sure that I could get involved in this project and be actively involved in this project.Happy to share all those letters with you. But all of that to say that I have worked really closely with staff from the first day until today, and I can tell you that never before have I experienced a staff member who has been such an amazing community partner.And it's Christopher has met with everybody. I'm going to talk a little bit about the process in a moment. And the plan that is before you today is a much, much different plan than the plan that was initially proposed.And I'll talk a little bit about why that is. And that didn't come about in a vacuum. And it certainly wasn't something that was decided on at the Planning Commission meeting alone. The plan that's before you today come.As a result of many, many discussions that city staff has had with community partners. And I'm really grateful for their leadership. This process actually started in 2004 with the Study Group and the old plan, which I'm very grateful to.Jan Hall, who's here today, was passed in 1977 and has lasted decades and served us very well, and it's no longer sufficient to meet the vision and the values of the current time. And that was the decision that was made in 2004, way before any of us were were involved in the decision making for the plan.That's tonight. That's before us tonight. This process started out for us in 2014 as CDEP and it was changed to see CIP. And it is obviously a very significant specific plan for the city of Long Beach and and for the third district because it is where we housed the most precious and greatest opportunity for wetlands restoration andpreservation and also economic development for the city. The plan being considered tonight was developed after three years of outreach, including 50 community meetings and countless one on one constituent meetings, not just with city staff, but with myself and my team.I cannot tell you how many times I've received telephone calls from people who are here tonight, some of whom actually went to the podium and said that they're opposing the plan, requesting a meeting with me the next day at the 11th hour, asking for my time, asking for me to meet with them repeatedly on the same issue. And it's it's it's unfortunate to me that despite the shaping of the plan, based on their input, to get us to the place where at tonight that they're still in opposition, I certainly had hoped that we would have been able to acknowledge the progress that was made in the plan as a result of their input.But as with all things I know, sometimes it's not. It's difficult to acknowledge the positive and much easier to highlight the negative. But in any event, staff's initial initial proposal on size up was 30% more density than it is now.And the rich and original recommendation they made was 5 to 7 stories, not 3 to 5 stories. Where we are today is as a result of the input that we received, and I'm very grateful for where we have landed.This proposal fixes shortcomings and encourages consistency in expectations. The proposed plan corrects the shortcomings of the original plan. Preservation of the wetlands was not as much of a priority in 1977 as it is today. And I say that because of the focus that we have had on wetlands preservation, conceptual design and restoration that's happened over the lastfive years, that has not happened in this city before. And in fact, again, some of the speakers tonight, Miss Cantrell, had talked about there being no development on the wetlands since CDEP was created in 1977. And that's absolutely not true.There has been development in the wetlands since 1977 that should have never happened on the wetlands. And this plan helps us restore that and make sure that doesn't happen. Under the old plan, residential and commercial developments on open wetlands were possible.And indeed, we have less open wetlands now than we would have had had we adopted a plan to preserve them. The current proposal allows those areas to be protected and limits development opportunities sites. A specific plan created for this area establishes requirements for anyone who seeks to develop in this area, and those requirements are based on thedesires and preferences expressed by the public. And yes, it's true, 200 people attending a community meeting certainly does not reflect the population of 500,000 in the city of Long Beach, but 200 people attending a community meeting, hundreds of people attending 50 community meetings is very significant in a particular district.I have seen outreach unlike that anywhere else in the city that it takes. Having a specific plan removes the variability that we see with developers seeking variances and exemptions. Everything is set beforehand and developers have a reasonable expectations on what the community and the public want.I want to thank some of the developers and their representatives who are here today, because I will tell you originally when they proposed plans three years ago, I made it very clear to them that the plans that they were proposing would not be something that I would support.And although because of tonight's appeal, I was precluded from expressing a solid opinion on this case prior to tonight, I made it very clear that I would not support a 5 to 7 storey height limit. Or the density options that were provided in the original proposal, rather than looking at projects on a case by case basis whichcan be inconsistent and based on different owners are stronger lobbyists or other special interests. The characteristics of a particular project are difficult negotiations. Instead of all that varied variability, a specific plan sets all the requirements before anyone proposes a project and bases those requirements on the specific wishes of the community.This particular element that's being proposed tonight is consistent with the vision that was laid out in 2004 and again when this process started with our stakeholder committee in 2014. Based on the vision developed by the community, this plan is forward thinking and embraces what we have stated in the vision.Examples of these elements include view corridors, public open spaces, wetlands preservation, wetlands, buffers of 100 feet, native planting, bird safe building treatments which I know the Audubon Society reached out to me specifically and requested and we made sure was included and most importantly, limits development to existing developed areas, meaning our wetlands will not be built upon.Most importantly, this plan allows for the creation of a wetlands restoration and monitoring fund that every new development will have to pay into. Among the items expressed as priorities in the community vision, this plan will create a gateway into the city that is more reflective of the beauty and charm of this area and will provide a moderateamount of new housing as highlighted in the staff report, which is much needed for the entire city. And it will also enhance our shopping restaurants and other retail opportunities. The plan addresses height, in my opinion, responsibly and gradually, and I would have never approved the recommendation that was initially proposed by staff for 5 to 7 feet.From the beginning, I have expressed to city staff that I was looking for a lower height alternative. The reality that heights up to 12 stories were once considered for this area prior to my serving on this council. Continues to perplex me.I'm not even sure how such a proposal would have made it to the Council for a vote. It's unclear to me because I cannot see a situation where my community would have supported that. This is not an area where downtown level heights make any sense and they don't reflect the community.I'm very pleased that the Planning Commission recommendations and staff's recent proposal limiting the height to five storeys for almost all except two of the parcels of land. This height is reasonable and goes to great lengths to set up community benefits with art, park, open spaces and commitments to our wetlands in exchange for future developments to be allowed. Additionally, if properties commit to even greater public benefits and are one of only a few properties further from the wetlands, they could build up to 15% of their property to seven storeys only if a hotel is included on that property.This would require major commitments from developers and huge investments in public outdoor benefits. Residents have again and again said they want like parks.Art view.Corridors, wetlands support and many other things that we would need.We will we would do.If we had that opportunity for any additional development. Large buildings that are seven stories tall is not something I would support. It is not something the community supports, and it is not something that this project allows for. Limiting heights in this area is extremely important because of the existing low height and keeping the area consistent and notcreating a heavy burden of new residences, but also in preservation of wildlife needs and bird flight paths. Height has been a significant consideration at every stage of this process, and it has been reduced and reduced again many times, and requiring major investment in public outdoor amenities and open space in exchange for any expanded height.There's been a great deal of concern regarding traffic at this intersection, and rightly so. This is an area of major concern. The current proposal addresses this concern. The recommendation by Planning Commission reduced density by 30%, which I fully support, and I commend them on that recommendation.This recommendation alone will reduce traffic impacts. Future development is also capped on a per acre basis based on peak vehicle trip generations. This is better, in my opinion, than a first come, first serve basis that might result in developments that are less thought out or not fully contemplated.More than 300 square feet of residential development has also been removed from the plan, further reducing maximum development and traffic connection of Shopkeeper Road to Studebaker Road is also part of this plan which will further reduce traffic pressures.Additional. We expect the plan will include many traffic design and engineering elements to alleviate traffic. These include breaking up super blocks to allow for access off of Second Street, adding multi-modal transportation options and infrastructure, and working with Caltrans to allow better city access to control controls over traffic signals at the intersection of Second and PCH.It is believed that changing the traffic signal timing alone can improve traffic flow by 5 to 7% from the current conditions. This is around the level when most motorists would start to see a difference in traffic flow. It's rare to get developers, property owners, environmentalists and residents together to collaborate on a single project.This project did that. It's also rare and frankly unheard of to have a final project that all of these entities would applaud together as a victory. And I don't believe that that will happen tonight. But to me, it is also a success because the public process led to a reasonable middle ground that does not lead to massivedevelopment tomorrow, but rather slow developments improving our community gradually over the next 40 years. This is not a max use of this area of land. It's a modest increase proposal which will allow redevelopment but do so in a way that is balanced and meets the needs of the communities along with preservation of the habitat.This plan includes provisions from every stakeholder and group and in my opinion, effectively embraces the vision we have set out to accomplish in 2014. I want to thank the people who came out to speak in favor and opposed to the proposal tonight.Your input is valuable and whether you said it at the podium or not, we spent a lot of time together and your opinions and thoughts are reflected in this proposal. You know that even though you didn't say it, many of you with whom I met repeatedly after work late evenings at your request, you know that what youasked for is in this proposal. I know it and you know it. You didn't say it at the podium, but that's okay. This is a great proposal, and I ask my colleagues to support it.Thank you very much. Council council member Councilor Maria Ringo.Thank you, Mayor. And I, too, want to thank everyone who came out today. If nothing else, it's your ability to engage in civic engagement with the city of Long Beach and anywhere you go. It's a democratic process, and that's what it's all about.And I'm glad that you're here, and I'm glad that you shared your comments with us because that's how we get to work things out. The decisions behind all we hear are not always easy, and they haven't been. This one is one of those that is not easy.Some comments that were made that were inaccurate I have to address. Yes, I was. And I continue to be a member of the Coastal Commission and I did address the issue of the Belmont Pool and its height. That height is obviously a concern, and I know it will be a concern to the Coastal Mission Coastal Commission onceit gets there. One of the things that I looked at immediately on this project was one of the heights that we're talking about and talking about five stories. So if if Chris can please answer by stories means what?What would be at the maximum height of a five story building?So a typical five story building could be in that 55 foot range. It could go up to 60 feet, which is four stories at ten feet each and a larger 20 foot bass story. So similar to the existing Marina Pacifica condos that are just across the waterway from a portion of our areas of change.Okay. So currently as proposed, the height limitations would not be increased significantly other than it sounds intimidating that we have five storeys. Is that correct?That's correct. In staff's view, it's not significant. It certainly was an area of great discussion and the heights have been adjusted down throughout the process in response to that great discussion we had with the public.Earlier, the panel mentioned 80 feet. So I mean, we're nowhere near 80 feet. So we're I think we're we're in a good place. The other aspects of this plan that I was looking at is also in terms of those that are mainly concern to also the Coastal Commission.And the only reason I'm saying that is because included in this plan is a modification of the LCP. The local coastal plan, which will again go to the Coastal Commission, will actually will look at again, I had a unique opportunity here to have to bite at this apple in the sense of visiting and revisiting this project fromtwo different points of view. And so what I'm trying to do is try to get a sense of where we can possibly land in a good place. This plan right here, from what I can see, addresses all of the issues that would be concerning me.And Councilmember Price has mentioned those. In fact, I have all of these bullet points and I could check them of a shoot as she was discussing them in terms of mitigating traffic. Also, one thing that was not mentioned, I was but it was it wasn't addressed in a very direct way.But Susie, the mere phrase it because remember Price and I both said on the wetlands lottery with wetlands authority and in that we also deal with some of the concerns that people have with the wetlands. One of the main things that also was brought up by the appellant was about the the size and the and the concernsof oil drilling there. Well, I can say that not many people know that the owner of those drills gave the city 100 acres of land to go towards wetlands, and it was donated to us and they only wanted to keep five acres of that.So we have an additional 100 acres of wetlands that we can restore. And the best part I like about it is that there's going to be some money going into a restoration fund that will help in that restoration process.So I think it's a wonderful opportunity for us to make developers responsible for their development by giving back. I see a lot of also here that there's there's a public benefit to all of this. There's a public benefit in providing additional access and providing bicycle lanes and providing those opportunities for people to come to Long Beach andenjoy all the resources and amenities that we have to offer here. So having said all that, I think that they can support this project. I know that Councilmember Price has some additional amendments that she would like to make.We discussed some of those. I think I can support those. But hopefully when we come down to the vote that we could get the support of our colleagues to endorse and support this project to go out and talk to customers.We're probably there'll be some additional changes coming because of, of course, commission rules and amendments and the and the Coastal Act that will come into play for that. So thank you very much.Thank you. Councilmember Vice Mayor Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I just want to chime in with a couple of thoughts. So, one, I you know, I remember when this conversation was before the last council and we followed it and it you know, and it's good to see how far the conversation has come.It's clear to me that, you know, the local councilmember Councilman Price, has put a lot of time into engaging, understand this issue, saying pretty much anything that would need to be said on this. You know, Chris, if this is indicative of the work that we're to expect with the without plan and some of the work there, we'rereally excited about that. But there's one area that I do want to you know, it's a bit it's a burning question on my mind and a lot of people's minds. And I noticed that there was some some focus on, like bird migratory patterns and bird activity, correct?That's correct. Okay. So so maybe you can answer this question for me. Do Birds of a feather. Actually flock together. We're looking forward to finding out in our great spaces that we're going to create in this area. Thank you.Thank you for your time on this. Thank you. Councilmember Pierce.Yes. Thank you for the laugh. Vice Mayor, I want to also echo Councilmember Price's comments. I sat on that side the last time the second PCH project was here and know very well that this is a very different project than was here before.And I want to say how much I appreciate all of those that have reached out to my office, which has been a small handful. And the list of comments that I have that have emailed in have all been in support as well.I know I've met with Mayor Bob and and a couple of other groups. And so, you know, I think that we've come a long way in talking about community benefit agreements, which wasn't a phrase that we even used before, that we've come a long way in trying to put together a process that is inclusive.And unfortunately, sometimes it's frustrating because it's hard to get everybody in. This is the story of tonight, right? Everybody to work together towards the same vision. And I do agree that this project does that. And I think that staff has worked really delicately in trying to move that process forward.I won't take up too much time. Besides saying that I know that the councilmember is working with you all and there'll be some changes at the end. I look forward to hearing those, but I'm really happy to see that we've taken a longer step and a slower process and that there's still opportunities in the future to evenmake this project more fitting for the neighborhoods on each piece. So I welcome that process. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Mongo.Yes. I want to say that I've enjoyed being a part of this process. There have been meetings throughout the city. One of the meetings that I attended was so.Long ago that the council, as it is today, has different.Members on it. And I was on the council at that time. And so I appreciate the public input. I appreciate that meetings happened throughout the city, not just in the third district.And I'm glad to hear that.So many of the original comments were included in the plan. I know that.Often community members believe that their comments are not held. For the record, and I will only reinforce.What I've been discussing a lot in the community is your opportunity for comment. Every night when we sit down at the dais, we receive a packet of comments on any agenda item that anyone uses online. And that's a really thoughtful way to put your your comments into the record in addition to coming forward and speaking.And so I would just continue to encourage that because we read those. And as you can tell, we listen at those meetings and the changes have been made and so great.Work to our staff.This has been a long process. We really appreciate you and all the work that you've put in, great work to the community getting to this point. And I hope that when we see the progress in the direction that we're looking towards, that we see that as a win in the right direction because not everyone can get everythingall the time. So congratulations to everyone who got something in this plan. Thank you.Thank you. And Councilwoman Pryce.Thank you. At this time, I'm going to make a series of motions and would ask for my colleagues support. First motion. It would be on the first. Would the clerk like to read that item or should I?

As I stated at the last meeting in December evening, it meant that a 12 year old can understand a independently of LP with d uh keep me keep making. I kept making redistricting maps. And I'd like to to point out, not only do I support this motion and support what he did with their map, but that if we'd had it, if he'd had an expert so called, uh, contracted for us, they clearly would have hit upon the same kind of logic that will be widely used to not overreach across the signal hill boundary and specifically over a temple street.For anyone who's interested, I was never interested myself in making the map, the redistricting map for the council districts of Long Beach, where I was interested in. Ah. Uh, the reason why we didn't just do the obvious thing, which was make historical Cambodia town as whole as possible, given the one chance we had with that aging populationand why we didn't just use Temple Street the way the zip code map does, the way the city council district map used to and why we didn't doing the exact same weeks. We're not only are we getting an infrastructure bill passed for the first time, but some of those crucial components of that infrastructure bill are electrical vehiclecharging stations. And where those charging stations are matter. It matters to Southern California Edison, for instance, for a kind of refilling of their existing assets. It matters for the rest of everyone else to not have a grid that is centralized around the wrong things.So there are major questions not only about our physical infrastructure, but about who owns and who controls them. And we don't have the time space to even begin to scratch the surface of them because, you know, frankly, I to come here and, you know, sit through our long redistricting meetings, they don't go anywhere because there seems tobe an agenda in. And I would gladly sit here for a minute and just stare at you, if that's what it takes. It's really, really unfortunate. School board believed in itself and in the students and people of this city.Why didn't the Independent Redistricting Commission, why didn't the city manager's office and the consultant working with them? Why didn't you believe the people of the city? To do it themselves. I was sitting here each week making a map, making another map, people that do it themselves.I'm not the only one.

Recommendation to support the Human Relations Commission's recommendation to suspend all non-essential travel to the state of North Carolina and Mississippi until the repeal of HB two and HB 1523.Thank you, Madam Clerk. As many of us know, many municipalities, including San Francisco, Seattle and New York City, have banned all non-essential travel to both North Carolina and Mississippi. What I'd like to share, and I believe that this is shared among quite a few of our members of our constituency, is that we cannot allow the continued discriminationagainst the LGBTQ community and must definitely take a stand that is meaningful. Long Beach is committed to creating and sustaining a community that promotes tolerance, respect and love for thy neighbor without regard to race, color, national origin, religious creed, disability, gender identity, or sexual orientation.We cannot keep hating and murdering each other because we do not agree with who they are, with whom they are, I should say. We must continue to act out in a way that is positive. And I believe that banning non-essential travel to North Carolina and Mississippi until they repeal their respective bills is our logical next step.Before. Well, we have a motion and a second, so if we can take it behind the dias. Councilman Gonzales.I want to thank you, Vice Mayor, for bringing this forward. I think it's it's exactly spot on what you're what you're mentioning. And Long Beach has been a city that has not discriminated against. We've been very open for our LGBTQ community.I think states that just seem to harbor these these ill, you know, feelings and these this hatred is really no place for us to be doing travel or non-essential travel to. I think this city is much greater than that.And we are. We just passed My Brother's Keeper about, you know, talking about the advances of people that definitely need our help the most. And I think coming off of such tragedy that has happened and coming off of just the beauty that exists here in the city of Long Beach with who we are and the diversity inso many different levels, I feel that this is a great step in solidifying our support for that. So thank you.Thank you. Councilman.Yes. Thank you, vice mayor. You know, in this day and time, I think it really hurts me, too, that we still are passing judgment on each other so much that they are considered less than persons instead of what they really are, which are human beings, you know, full and participate in every right that each of us wereborn with. You know, that said, I just stand with you. And I really, truly believe that we are all God's children. We need to treat each other as such. This is a such a tragedy. But with that, all that said, we have to really stay vigilant to everything we watch and see.Thank you very much for bringing this to the diocese.Thank you, Councilmember Richardson.Thank you. I just want to say that I wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly support the Human Relations Commission's request. And I want to thank Vice Mayor Lowenthal and my colleagues for inviting me to sign on.Thank you. Councilman Austin.Yes. An injustice to one is an injustice to all. I support the Human Relations Commission and I really want to just applaud them for for bringing this this item forward shows that they are actually working as a commission, being thoughtful and and proactive to try to bring issues like this to our attention.So I will definitely be in support.Thank you. And are there any members of the public that wish to address the Council on item 38 who's come forward?Good evening, Honorable Vice Mayor and members of the City Council. My name is Myles McNeely and I'm the acting chair of the Human Relations Commission. I wanted to first thank you all for taking the time to address this very important issue.I'll be brief in summarizing our recommendation. I did want to highlight that we were unanimous in supporting this recommendation and that survey. And as I mentioned, several cities across the nation have already instituted similar travel bans. Part of what fueled our engagement in this issue was learning about two separate incidents that occurred this year where transgender personswere victimized in Long Beach because of their perceived gender identity or their perceived, perceived transgender identity. After hearing about these of these events, one of which was a violent stabbing of a transgender woman, the Human Relations Commission developed developed a very deep concern about the dignity, safety and well-being of transgender persons in Long Beach.We believe that this travel ban demonstrates solidarity with the LGBT community, and we believe that we must continue to reinforce the notion, the notion that all members in our community are deserving of respect and dignity as the City Council's Principle Advisory Commission promoting peace, tolerance and mutual respect.We believe that adopting this recommendation sends a clear message that Long Beach is a city that embraces these ideals and embraces our diverse community. Thank you.Good evening, Vice Mayor. Members of council. My name is Porter Gilbert. I'm the executive director of the LGBTQ Center of Long Beach. I am also joined this evening by Stellar SEWA, who is a member of our board of directors.I want to give my my biggest thanks to Vice Mayor Lowenthal, Councilwoman Gonzalez and Councilmember Richardson for spearheading this effort at the council level. And huge thanks to the Human Relations Commission for continuing to prioritize the prioritize LGBTQ issues and understanding that we still have quite a bit of work to do.What laws like the ones in Mississippi and North Carolina say about LGBTQ people is that we are not valued, that we are not worthy of protection, that we are not worthy of being able to walk about in public safely without question.We know from from many instances here in Long Beach and throughout the United States that since these laws have have been passed, that people have now taken it upon themselves to begin questioning people in restrooms and asking them whether or not they belong in restrooms and attacking them when they're in restrooms.We know that people can no longer sue for discrimination in the state of North Carolina, not just for discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, but based on race or disability. So these laws have a very national impact, even if they were enacted at the state level.And by enacting a non-essential travel ban, you are sending a message that Long Beach refuses to stand in the face of discrimination silently. You're standing with our LGBTQ community here in Long Beach, and you're standing with the LGBTQ community and the rest of the United States.So thank you very much for your consideration this evening.Thank you, Porter. Next speaker, please.Good evening. My name is Alexandra Billings. I'm an actress and I'm an assistant professor of theater at California State University, Long Beach. I am celebrating in December my 20th wedding anniversary to my wife, who I met in 1976.I am also transgender, and I transitioned in 1980. I'm 54 years old and I'm not really sure where some of these states think. I've been going to the bathroom for the past 30 years. But it has been in women's restrooms.I've also changed my clothes. Been in locker rooms for a very, very long time. And nothing terrible has ever happened. However, terrible things have happened to me because of what I am. I've been beaten, hit, called names. And raped at gunpoint because I'm transgender.Now, I know there's a lot of debate about what I am. And I really understand it because I do understand that you might look at my life and think, well, you could just choose something differently. And that would be great.Believe me, if I could make a choice about my lifestyle. It would have been something that would have caused a lot of people far less pain and riddled me, probably with far less shame. But I've come to realize in the 54 years I've been on the planet that what I am is a great gift.It's a spiritual gift, and it's a gift of the heart and the mind, and that what I am propels me into something new. So I want to reassure you. And I heard here in this room just in the last 15 minutes, somebody's talking about recruitment of gays.And I can assure you, the only thing that I have ever remotely recruited was people to come to my house and watch Judy Garland clips. And I don't think that that's detrimental to anyone's spirit. So I just want to say lastly, that I, I want you behind me.And what I mean is that for me, it's less about banning travel and more about me feeling you're behind the revolution. Any marginalized community, if any marginalized community were being treated this way and being told that they couldn't go into restrooms.Or had been able to use drinking fountains or been able to ride it in any part of the bus, the entire tire country would be outraged. So I ask you to be behind our movement, our revolution. Thank you very much.Thank you. There's been a motion in a second and we've heard public comment.

Our next item is ordinance number 2017 0481, which would establish a King County Immigrant and Refugee Commission. This was a follow up to a recommendation by the King County Immigrant and Refugee Task Force. And today we're just receiving a briefing.And here to brief us are council staff members Andrew Kim and Mike Reid. Welcome.Thank you, Madam Chair. Mike reads as deputy counsel. I'm here, as you indicated, with Andrew Kim, and we will provide a brief bit of background on this. This ordinance actually starts on page 17 of your packets. So as you've indicated, Madam Chair, that the discussions on this this topic began in 2015 when the council was presented withinformation about the increasing numbers of new arrivals from throughout the world that were settling in King County. Demographic and sensitive information confirmed that there had been a significant increase in the immigrant refugee population. Council discussions at that time centered on means to address the challenges faced by these populations, as well as means of assuring access to countyservices for these populations. The concept of a commission had been suggested as a means to address these concerns. The parameters, however, of such a commission were uncertain, particularly regarding representation on a such a commission. So the the council at that time in 2015 established a task force on immigrant refugees to make recommendations about the shape and characterof such a commission. Again, addressing representation and addressing structure, addressing its purpose and the duties of such a commission. That task force began meeting in October of 2015 and continued this meeting through through June of 2016. I'd held meetings throughout the county and it hosted input from a significant number of members of the immigrant Mexican community toget their their ideas about the shape and character of such a commission. A final report was developed and issued in July of 2016. That report actually is in your packets, I believe, on page 39 of the packet. That became the basis for the development of the measures before you today and which resulted from discussions between the executiveand the and council staff for its formulation. Andrew will take it from here. Thank you, Mike. Good morning, Madam Chair. And Council Members, Andrew Kim, a council central staff. I'll continue the briefing by summarizing key provisions of the proposed ordinance.This can be found on page 19 of your staff report. Section three outlines the purpose of the Commission. The two primary responsibility of the Commission are one to act as a central point of contact, communication and coordination of all stakeholders serving and engaging immigrant and refugee residents.The the task force states that this responsibility would fill a significant gap, since no organization or group plays a central role. The task force also states that this will help to take a regional approach to complex issues that stretch across multiple municipalities.And the second responsibility, primary responsibility, is focus on. Focusing on understanding and addressing challenges faced by immigrant and refugee communities living in suburban cities and unincorporated areas of the county. The task force states that this responsibility would help alleviate the lack of county resources invested in suburban and incorporated communities, which disproportionately impact the immigrant and refugee communities. Going to page 20, Section four outlines the criteria of the 17 member board where 13 are voting members and four are non-voting members. I won't list each criteria here, but you can find the criteria of the voting members on page 20.The four non-voting members are to be community leaders that are actively engaged with local government, business or philanthropy, philanthropic organizations to raise the visibility and capacity of the Commission. Section five outlines the joint effort between the Council and executive in conducting outreach to solicit candidates.It also directs that the list of candidates for appointment would be finalized by a Joint Committee of Executive and council representatives and past commissioners. Section six requires the Commission to produce an annual report to the Council and to make the annual report.Related briefly and related briefings available to the community. Section seven requires the Commission to convene at least monthly with four Commission meetings to be held in suburban cities or unincorporated areas and to hold at least one large community briefing each year.Section eight requires that an employee from the Office of Equity and Social Justice and one Council employee staff the work of the Commission. And lastly, Section nine requires the executive to reimburse Commission members for travel expenses and or parking fees for attending meetings, starting on the bottom of page 21 Staff Writer.Some additional analysis the proposed ordinance incorporates, as Mike said, most of the recommendations from the Immigrant and Refugee Task Force report. However, it does not incorporate all the recommendations. Some of the key differences include. Number one, the task force recommended providing an honorarium or stipend to commissioners.However, this is not included in the proposed ordinance. Another difference is that the task force recommended three staffing options where they strongly recommended an option to establish an office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs. The proposed ordinance shows the lowest cost staffing option of of providing one FTE to support the work of the Commission.And lastly, the task force provided no recommendation on age as a factor for Commission membership. But the proposed ordinance includes a requirement that members should represent a range of age groups, including persons representing youth issues. Lastly, the annual cost to support the work of the Commission is estimated to be approximately $147,000.The breakdown of that cost is listed on page 23. Madam Chair, that concludes our staff report. And and we have several members of the Immigrant and Refugee Task Force joining us today and as well as executive staff from the Office of Equity and Social Justice.Okay. Thank you for that briefing. I understand, Councilmember Garcia, your office has been working on this. Would you like to say a few words or begin the discussion?Yes. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I have some questions for our staff, but I'm also going to have some questions for the folks that he mentioned that are present. First of its staff, why does it say that this commission will only deal with issues relative to immigrant and refugee folks who reside in unincorporated Kane County orthe suburbs? The reason I ask that is that I represent a district that's 90% okay in Seattle, and I've had bukele meetings. I mean, I've had many meetings in South Asia with Eritreans, Ethiopian Somalis, Thai Vietnamese and on the recent killing and and not dealing with refugee problems in the city of Seattle.What's the thinking?Yes, Councilmember, let me clarify that. So the work of the commission doesn't exclude the work that they would do for the entire county, but it does and includes the city of Seattle and other areas of King County. But what it does do is that it calls out the commission to focus on issues concerning immigrant refugees that livein the suburban and unincorporated areas. So rather than is not limiting their work to those communities, but it's asking them to make that a focus of their work. And I might I might briefly add that you may recall that that over the course of the work, the task force, there was input from members of the community, notingthat historically the focus had been on immigrant refugee communities within within urban areas or within the cities themselves or within the city, Seattle in particular. But that there was an increasing concern about the limited access and limited resources that were available to immigrants and refugees who lived in suburban cities or in the unincorporated area, which tended notto receive the same degree of attention. So this was an attempt to highlight and focus on the the that concern.Okay. And Andrew or Mike, originally somebody said that they thought the commissioners should get paid 20 that idea come from.So the concept of the honorarium or stipend was recommended by the task force. So in the task force report which is attached to to your staff report, they they recommended that that the the commission members be compensated for their work because many of the commissioners are often overworked and asked to serve on many other committees.So that was the task force's recommendation. But it's not included as as part of this proposed ordinance.It's not a part of it. See, because I've been involved in I think I've been a county council member for 24 years and we've set up a lot of I mean, I was the sponsor of the Civil Rights Commission back in 96, and my co-sponsor was Kent Pullen.So we wanted bipartisan support. And then I've been involved in sort of a lot of task force and advisory groups and never have we had as part of the mandate to pay people for the advice that they give us.So my fear was that if we set a precedent here, we'd have them all coming back, say, we're overworked and we're giving our service like watch all because that wasn't paid time. So I'm kind of happy that wasn't included in the final document.Thank you, Manager.Thank you, Mr. Bassett. Any other councilmember up the grove?Thank you, Madam Chair. And this may be a question for the sponsor, unless staff has some context. Well, one one super quick, easy question. And then the one I was saying, one is the assumption and I didn't look at the fiscal note.Are there funding sources other than general fund available? Were that 147 likely come out of general fund? It would most likely be coming out of the general fund. A majority of that cost is its personnel cost. And the executive staff have noted that that 0.5 FTE that was staff that commission is that there's an existing employee inthe Office of Equity Social Justice. So we wouldn't be adding additional funds, but it would be kind of existing expenses, right. At least from the executive side on the council side, that that has yet to be determined. But yeah, which was my question.And this I don't know if it's more appropriate for the sponsor or to see if you to take a stab at it. In terms of the rationale for having part of the staffing come from the county council staff, it's a little bit different.We the Women's Commission, the Civil Rights Commission, or many of our other county task forces. Art. We have staff here that will support our work on those, but we don't have dedicated staff, that is, to staff the commission and wondering what the thinking was in terms of why.Why for this particular commission, we would have the legislative branch provide part of the staff support. And so against I just kind of want to understand it. Yeah. So when, when, when, when we were drafting the proposed ordinance with members of the different council offices because the immigrant and refugee work was more of a collaborative approach, eventhe task force, I think, I believe, was staffed by a council staff member and an executive staff member. I believe they wanted to take that collaborative approach to the commission as well. So which is the reason for that?I I'm going to add to that because you said maybe the sponsor might want to say something about this. I support the idea of the commission having on staff and that would be half from the executive and a half from us.But my rationale is more political than anything else. With half the staff, the half time staff person being a part of our staff, the I think that the accountability of that person to the priority issues relative to immigrant and refugee populations in King County that are now almost 19% of the total, we'd have more of a saycompared to where they are leaving the staff support and the staff are all in the executive. That was my thinking. Thank you.Any other comments or questions. This is not actually a we can take action today if we're prepared to, but it was on for a first briefing today. So it's the looking around to see the will of the body.Then we will want to just do it. I'm seeing some desire to do it. Councilmember Garcia, would you be willing to put proposed ordinance number 2017 0.1 before us?But of course, I don't care.I refuse. Yasmin, it is commendable.I would like to propose that the King County Council adopt ordinance number 2017. That's 0481, establishing an immigrant and refugee commission here in King County.It's been moved by the do pass recommendation. Any other comments or discussion before we move to a vote? I will say just one thing. I want to appreciate the members of the commission who worked so hard and on a volunteer basis to to make these recommendations that were now starting to move forward with, thank you for yourwork. I see a lot of friendly faces out there and thank you Martires also for being along with us. I look forward to seeing this body come together and I'm excited about the work that we'll be able to do with this kind of support from the community.All right. Councilmember Tomasky, the.Thing that I'm sure just very briefly, I appreciate the action here by the committee today. I want to also thank the members of the task force. A couple of years ago, when my office was working with Councilmember Gossage to kick start this initiative, I said, why don't we just form the commission?Let's just let's just cut to the chase. Why don't we just have one? And my staffer, Christina Logsdon, who's put a lot of work into this, said, well, you'll get a better product if you work with the community.And I think that today's legislation bears that out, that the task force process and the deliberative approach that they've taken in conjunction with the executive's office has led to a thoughtful proposal, I think, before us today that will stand the test of time.And so I just want to take a moment to thank the task force for their thoughtful work and thank my staffer, Christina Logsdon, for her work on this and commitment to these issues. And just one final thought on the compensation experience that you had.Some some words on. My understanding of this issue is, frankly, it's again and again we go and we turn to leaders in the community for their expertize and advice, who often face additional challenges and hurdles in just kind of getting through the day, to put it bluntly.And this notion of of kind of going to the well for free, I think, to some degree comes from a real privilege, the attitude that some of us have more time and resources to be able to do that.And I think we should think about in the future whether or not we are taking that privileged viewpoint and not reflecting on what we're asking folks to do for free. And it can be a burden and a barrier to service and therefore impede the work that we want and the results we want from organizing from groups likethis. So I'm open on that question and I don't think it has to apply universally, but in a particular case, particularly on immigrant refugee community commission, immigrant Refugee Commission, that might be staffed by folks who faced more challenges in our community and we're service without compensation is a higher barrier, but something I think we should look at. So I'm I'm.Okay. I don't have any problem with looking at it. I think that those who advise on juvenile and adult criminal justice issues could make a case that they're providing invaluable services that or they aren't getting paid. I also think that people who are advising us on, you know, any emergency setting up an effective emergency services strategy inKing County could make a case and they would bring up Katrina in not having adequate means of reaching out to the poor and disadvantaged. And they're often invisible. So so many groups that we have set up advisory boards and commissions for over the years that would make the case for that.But I definitely do not mind having that discussion with you and other members of the county council and the community as we move forward.Again, thank you. Thank you.Well.My sense is that the. Decision is not made by this action today. It's just not in it. It's a silent as to this issue. And so it remains sort of an open issue, I believe. That's correct. Okay. I will add my $0.02 that I think it's important that we, at a minimum, give people food when they cometo these meetings. It just everything goes better when you feed people a second. Yeah. As a member of the group.Thank you, Madam Chair. The discussion made me want to weigh in as well. I think as a matter of philosophy, I agree wholeheartedly. The challenges, as Councilmember Gossett mentioned, this is an are only condition. And are we in a position to be able to afford to do that?And how do we do it equitably among our different volunteer agencies and do it? And which leads me into my my budget grump comment on budget terrorism. I love this work. I'm excited to support it. Obviously, I think we need to watch moving forward for bureaucratic creep and make sure that this is lean, mean and focused ondelivering the services. You know, there are some staffing models proposed that were significantly more costly and more robust than other task forces. There's a recommendation to look at opening a new office. I think we need to recognize that we're taking this progressive and exciting step forward in a budget landscape where we continue to have our ability ofrevenue to grow beyond 1% plus new construction and have other pressures, you know, whether it's underfunded public defense system, a 500 felony case backlog in the courts, you name it. So I think one of our challenges will be to make this as effective and deliver the results that we need for this community while also being able tofund the direct services that benefit immigrants and refugees as well. So that's my my budget grump were a word of caution about some of it. But that being said, this is a long time coming and it's, I think is going to be an important tool, particularly for the folks I represent in South King County.In our discussion with the Harborview appointee, we talked a little bit about the suburbanization of poverty and the shifting demographics. And in these small suburban communities down south, you don't have the centralized government like you have in Seattle.You don't have cities that have the professional staff and expertize to do the kinds of community engagement and service delivery that's needed. At the same time, we have probably the most diverse population and in particular the largest concentrations of immigrant and refugee populations.So having the county take a step forward to centralize and streamline and improve our work to serve that population, particularly with the you know, I obviously don't object to the line that Councilmember Gossett was exploring serving the whole county, but having a little bit of a focus on those suburban and unincorporated areas, I think isn't necessarily abad thing. And so I'm really excited about this and appreciate Councilmember Gossett, bring it.Forward.Okay. Any other questions? Comments? I'll ask the court to please Calderon. Thank you, Madam Chair. Councilmember Dombrowski. Councilmember Dunn. Hi. Councilmember Garcia. Hi. Councilmember Cornwell's Councilmember Lambert. Councilmember McDermott. Hi. Councilmember of the Grove. Councilmember Yvonne Ricardo. Madam Chair.Hi, Madam Chair. The voters are nice. No noes. Councilmember Caldwell's excused. Thank you very much. By your vote, proposed ordinance number 2017 0481 will move to the full council with a do pass recommendation. I think we will not put this one on consent.Councilmember Gossett So this is an opportunity to speak to it. Okay, very good. All right. Thank you very much. Staff. We will move on to proposed ordinance number 2017 0475.

We're going to item 13, please.Item 13 Communication from Councilman Austin, Councilwoman Mongo, Councilwoman Sara and Vice Mayor Richardson. Recommendation to explore additional options to provide services to other local cities and agencies in areas such as public safety, health and animal care services and public works.Okay. I'm going to have Councilmember Austin, please.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I think this item is pretty straightforward. Our city is growing and I think is recognized as an invisible leader in many respects. And we are surrounded by many contract cities. This is an item that that I have been thinking about and talking to colleagues about for several years, actually maximizing our resources andleveraging the resources that we have to extend our services, but also help our bottom line here in the city, our residents, as well as our potentially our our general fund. This is a direction to the city manager to begin having conversations with other cities about potential services that we can contract in.Right. That we can provide for neighboring cities and proximate proximity to. That makes sense, for example, and I will just put it out there. You know, there is a city that's like little early, right in the middle of Long Beach.Right. That that contracts would with the county RFP should be put forth to to to look at the services that we could provide, be it our health department public works, be it fire police resources. These are great resources that if if.If we are being smarter, if other cities are being smarter, we could we could we could really leverage our resources and provide great services to the residents and neighbors in Long Beach and around Long Beach. And so those are my comments.I would really love to hear from my colleagues to get your your thoughts on this. But I think this is a direction that we should be going in. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Mongo.Thank you. I am so excited to be supportive of this item. This is something that Al and I have talked about for years. Back when I was Budget Vice Chair in 2015 and we talked about some of the opportunities that we have.I know that even before I was a council person, back when Mr. Keisler was with Animal Care Services, we talked about even offering some of these services to L.A. County, as the fifth District has pockets of unincorporated areas that when a stray cat has an issue, L.A. County sends someone from Downey.And that's just not an effective use of their resources. It's not great response times for our residents and neighboring residents. Those residents believe that we are their city council, even though they live in an unincorporated area. Oftentimes my office gets calls and we kind of help triage and say, What color are your trashcans?Our trash cans are these colors, and if your trash cans are those colors, you live in the unincorporated area of Long Beach and they don't recognize that. Sometimes we may we kind of provide services even to Orange County in terms of animal services and others.So I don't want us to limit ourselves. Even L.A. County, in their contract cities model, does provide some services to Orange County cities. On our border, we have unincorporated Orange County of Rossmore, Cypress, Los Alamitos, and so many others.We're here to partner. I had a great talk today with a vice mayor of a neighboring city and a councilmember of a different city and just so excited that they are excited to hear what opportunities are possible. Long Beach provides first rate services and Long Beach staff are some of the best staff in the country.From public administration standpoint, we are just so fortunate to have so many great employees and as we expand these services, we'll be able to expand the number of employees we have on staff. And really the coordination between cities will be better.Many Border Council members like myself, that border other cities, we often have coordination challenges that we could improve if we were providing those services in both areas, it wouldn't be a this is their jurisdiction or our jurisdiction. The line actually goes here.And so enforcement issues come up sometimes. And I think that this would be just an amazing opportunity. So I enthusiastically support and bring this to the city staff and look forward to their creative ways of really growing Long Beach and our ability to provide high quality of life and improve the quality of life for not just LongBeach residents, but those in the cities around us who often work, play and enjoy Long Beach. Thank you.Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I really just want to take a moment and thank Councilman Austin for inviting me to sign on to this our border. I've said this a lot. There are five city halls closer to my district than my own city hall.We border Lakewood, Bellflower, Paramount, Lakewood. Bellflower, Paramount. Compton, Rancho Dominguez. It's actually six signal hills, technically closer to my house than City Hall. There's six city halls closer to my house. Then there's the downtown. And that that matters because, you know, when you're on the edge, when something happens in one city, I get a phone call aboutthat issue, something, you know, there was an incident where there was a shooting on one border. The shooting occurred on one border. The person fell into our border. You had two agencies standing there wondering what was going to happen.How are we going to process that, you know? So I make it a point to work with these different city managers know the council members, because we'll have issues that sometimes are strong allies, the national issues. And there have been multiple conversations about fire services in Compton and other other services.And on top of that, like, let's be honest, we're signing right now our vaccination process. All the things we've done, the leadership our public health department has done looks good and people are interested. So I'm fully supportive of this.I think we should look at, you know, make sure, you know, my interest would be that we look at bordering cities and have some direct conversation with those city managers about what opportunities may exist, because it may enhance our own services here, particularly on the far outskirts of the city with respect to public safety and some ofthe other things. Thanks a lot. Happy to support. Thank you. Next up, I have Councilwoman Sorrell.Thank you. I want to thank Councilmember Austin for introducing the items and my colleague, Councilmember Mongo and Vice Mayor Richardson for supporting as well. And for they said a lot and I agree with them. And I think that I just want to add a few things.District six Borders Signal Hill And I think that it just contributes to regional cohesion and coordination. When we're able to explore what makes the most sense, sometimes it's more efficient to contract to another city who has that infrastructure set up.So for that reason, and for many of the things my colleagues said, that's why I support this item. Thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman Allen.Yeah. Thank you, Mayor. I also appreciate council members Austin and Mango and Sorrow and Rex Richardson for bringing this item forward. And I would always encourage staff to look at ways to boost efficiencies and service levels in innovative ways.I know I talked previously at the Council meeting about opportunities to provide services like our police helicopter and to bordering cities, and we can look at opportunities to provide street work at our city borders. And I know that we had looked in the past for adding fire services to Signal Hill.So maybe there is an opportunity for us to explore that again. I just think this is just a great item. It's a great way to grow our city revenue and to hire more city staff and happy to support this.Thank you very much. I have customary ringa. I want to add.My voice to the support of Saddam. My district borders the city of L.A. and the city of Carson and the little cities north of that. So it would be a great opportunity to see what what we can do, how we can expand and grow out there.Also, I also wanted to see a lake as well. This is a way, I think.Thank you. And I think we have one member of the public wishing to speak, I believe.Yes. We have Dave Shukla.Hello.Yes. Again.Thank you. Good evening.As you heard.Earlier this afternoon in the budget study session and in the council discussion on the Recovery.Act passed.In item 15. Thank you very much, by the way. As we heard earlier, there's a clear need for structural funding solutions as we chart a course for economic recovery, particularly after the immediate.Disbursement of the Recovery Act money.We are a major city and we are a regional anchor, and it's important that this discussion is taking place, and it's important that the city look.To.The various services that it can provide when it comes to public works. Specifically, one of the options still open to us.When we talk.About things like street lighting is developing a community choice aggregation program of buy for from the city for this not only this city but for the greater Long Beach area, for the whole Alameda corridor. In fact, there are strong reasons, economic recovery reasons, emissions reduction reasons, consumer choice reason, but also structural budget realignment from our current municipaldependance on oil extraction and sales without a managed transition to a clean energy economy. A lot of our current assets are very quickly going to flip to liabilities uncovered risks. The city of Long Beach really should look at this program as a potential way to to move forward.Thank you.Thank you. That concludes public comment for this item.Thank you will go back to the council at that. Everyone that was queued up so we can go ahead and go to a vote. Let me go ahead and do the roll call vote, please.Councilwoman Sun has asked Councilwoman Ellen Fine. Councilwoman Pryce.I.Councilman. Have been asked by Councilwoman Mangum. Councilwoman manga.

Thank you very much. And thank you, Stephanie, who is also obviously putting a lot of work into that. With that, let me move on to item number 16.Communication from Councilwoman Price, Vice Mayor Andrew's Council member. The recommendation to receive and file a report requested by Councilman Price from CSU L.B. Anthropology Department on the topic of Long Beach homelessness and outreach efforts.Thank you, Councilman Price.Thank you. For the record, this is not the debate portion yet. I am presenting the agenda item. So I'm so glad to be receiving this report today. So if we can have our Long Beach State students come down, I'd really appreciate it.It was over two years ago now that we began discussing this research and the important role it could play for addressing homelessness in Long Beach. I want to thank our homeless outreach team and the Health Department, as well as our quality of life officers in the police department and our heart units in the fire department for workingso closely with these students to ensure their research and information was strong. Focusing on the incredibly difficult question of why some people experiencing homelessness refuse services could have a huge impact on the way we conduct outreach. It takes 17 interactions on average to convince and build the credibility with an individual to accept services.And those 17 interactions are over months and sometimes years and mean city staff has to spend time and work to conduct this outreach and to build that credibility, focusing on how we can reduce that number and tailor outreach to get people to accept the fantastic services we provide here in Long Beach not only helps individuals, but improvesour community and could save us money for classes from Cal State. Long Beach's anthropology department worked on this project for over two years. Over 550 hours of outreach and field work went into this report. They had 487 documented outreach encounters.Information on the use of global tickets and their potential benefits to getting people into services was very interesting. They did interviews with service providers that we partner with as a city and provided details on various hurdles to getting into services that can be studied as a city as we look at making our services and our outreach moreefficient. So I'm going to welcome our team from CSU. I'll be to the podium. I want to thank you for your patience tonight. The students got to see how democracy works and to be a part of that process.Thank you.Honorary Mayor and member of councils. AUDIENCE Good evening. My name is Mitra Baghdadi. I'm from Department of Anthropology at California State University, Long Beach. And with me, I have a department chair, Dr. Karen Quintilian. Two of our students, Acacia, Adel, Anton, know one and two of our undergraduate undergraduate students, Phenix, Pedro and Iris Salazar.Homelessness got my attention. And when the movement of not in my backyard started popping up on our news feed and I noticed substantial number of close consultation and meeting by city officials and police officers were being held in the different communities across this city and neighborhood, and it was a part of process of how to do that, increasing part of process to deal with, you know, increasing number of homeless individuals in the streets. Since I live in District three, I also work in District three in case State Longreach and I have witnessed how Constable Missy Price product proactively was working to address homelessness issues around the city.Therefore, I approached her with an idea of creating a project that is mutually beneficial partnership between City of Long Beach and Department of Anthropology in California State University. Long Beach. Addressing a critical issue like homelessness, which is very important for our city and community.Councilwoman Suzy Price as she mentioned, invited and introduced Dr. Quintilian and I at. And our idea of this collaboration to meet with. And Ms.. Ms.. Theresa Chandler, city manager. Bureau of Helping of Health Services. And also with Ms..Shannon Parker, Homeless Officer, Service Officer in March of 2017. I want to acknowledge that both of them are here. Thank you very much. For two years of collaboration. They they've worked with our students very and the entire two years.And our students were very fortunate to basically get many guidance from their. We listen to some of their challenges and we discuss a plan to conduct conduct. Ethnography research. Councilwoman Suzy Pryce wanted to make sure the project is a city recognized project and is specifically wanted to make sure that our students get the recognition for working onthis project with the city and experience that needed to get our project. And our research is focused on understanding why many individuals who are experiencing homelessness don't regularly take up services offered to them by the city or government service providers.We tried to understand this question from multiple perspectives. We tried individuals, including individuals who are currently receiving services with individuals who are refused services. And more importantly, we talked with the authority members who attempt to address each client unique circumstances.In past two years. Dr. Karen Quintilian and I, in anthropology department with 12 graduate student and 14 undergraduate students, worked on a collaborative research project with the Department of Health and Human Services based and many of the continuum of care partners including.Quality of life officers in the police department and health and and fire department, homeless education response team, heart team and many other service providers, including faith based organizations that they play a really important role of giving service to the homeless population in Longreach and.Six of us here. Yeah, six out of six of us here, we are presenting our research, the booklet you have in your hand. We divided our talk into different things. We promise we won't take time. That's much. I know.You have a long night. I would like to invite Dr. Quintilian to share some of our funding findings with you.Good evening and thank you, Mayor Garcia and council members. And it's really hard to follow a debate about how long a presentation should be. So I can assure you we did make sure we were, in a word limit.Just so you know. And with that in mind, I do want to really express, you know, sincere appreciation for making this possible to present these research findings on homeless outreach in our city. You know, with four of the key students that prepared this report, there were several other students involved that conducted the research that was described byCouncil member Susie Price in the number of hours that went into it. And I want to just point out some of those key findings and then invite them up to do a brief description of their research posters and some other key findings that they worked on as part of this report.I'd like to emphasize that this report is really meant for you to read as a whole, to really understand the inner workings of the street team. We examined the professional qualities and skills of this team in creating the conditions for service acceptance, both short and long term, and the hurdles they helped people overcome in that process.So I'm just going to outline for you to just, you know, cue up when you read the report, some of these key findings today. First, service acceptance is a continual process. Almost all of the 487 outreach encounters, documented and observed, led to the outreach team goals being achieved in one way or another.Building trust and rapport, for example. Assessing needs immediate and longer term. Determining eligibility. Acting as a liaison to service and guiding people through the hurdles to care. Second, multiple contacts between outreach team members and those experiencing homelessness is critical to under overcoming the lack of trust in, quote, the system that people may possess and believing that personalchange is possible. Faced with hurdles, some people simply give up. Clients describe specifically accepting service as a matter of being ready, being able to meet service criteria. Finding a program that fits their needs. And having the support of people such as the outreach team to meet their goals.Third, as the frontline workers, the outreach team are responsible for addressing the hotline, calls and emails from the Long Beach community members. They use professional skills to negotiate and manage the needs of both the larger Long Beach community and people experiencing homelessness.They conduct outreach in a manner that fosters communication and trust. In that regard for the outreach team innovates to facilitate people experiencing homelessness to take the first step to accessing services. And lastly, further research is needed to identify how the factors that contribute to successful service acceptance can be adapted and how the hurdles to access to servicesor gaps in services can be addressed. The outreach team has critical knowledge and expertize in understanding both of these areas that can inform practices. And now I'd like to invite up the students just to share very, very briefly some of the highlights of their research posters.And thank you very much.Hello.My name is Ira Salazar.I'm an undergraduate student and I'm part of the anthropology department at Colby. I'm also part of the Building Infrastructure Leading to Diversity Program, which is a mentor based research program.Which has given me the.Opportunity to be part of the homelessness, homelessness, ethnographic research and Education Lab. My part in the homeless outreach research was assisting in the data analysis and also writing the report that you are being provided today. My poster titled Let Them Get to that Place Understanding the role of outreach staff connecting homeless individuals to services focuses on thequality of the outreach members need to possess in order to effectively.Perform their jobs.And I encourage you to read pages four and five to learn on the report to learn more about the qualities outreach members need to have in themselves in order to effectively connect individuals to services. Thank you.Hello. My name is Phenix. Pedro and I will be graduating next week with my bachelor's degree in anthropology at Cal State Long Beach. And then in the fall, I'll be attending a Ph.D. program at Notre Dame University. My project in the here lab revolved around analyzing field notes in interviews to identify the types of obstacles or hurdlesthat individuals experiencing homelessness face while attempting to obtain services. Many of these obstacles are things like acquiring the proper documentation and identification in order to gain access to services. There are strict rules and regulations around services, insufficient amount of services, lack of transportation and lack of trust.These are the types of hurdles or obstacles that the outreach team assists people in overcoming when possible and when they are ready. And this can be seen in the barriers portion of the report on pages 16 and 17 in the report.And this research poster here, which is titled Barriers to Accessing Homeless Services in Long Beach, California, which is one of three that have been presented at multiple research conferences over the last year.Hello. My name is Tyne and I'm a graduate student in the Applied Anthropology Program at Cal State Long Beach. For my research, I honed in on looking at quality of life police officers to work with the outreach team.And what I learned was that they handle most, if not all, of the division service calls that involve people experiencing homelessness. It alleviate some of the pressure off of patrol units and helps the police department provide the most public, good possible quality of life.And the street team work together in coordinated outreach. The officers ensure the safety of the team and provides access to locations the team may not visit. Normally, enforcement is conducted very rarely and strategically. In my personal field work sample of 109 outreach interactions, only 15 included some form of enforcement, like a citation or arrest.Instead, the quality of life officers focused on building rapport, learning what their needs, the needs of the people they're meeting are, and figuring out how they can help the people they meet. There's a lot more detail on page nine that I invite you to look at.Thank you.Hello. My name is Acacia and Alan. I'm a graduate student in the Department of Anthropology. My contribution to this project was examining the transitional period between living on the streets and becoming housed and highlighting the lack of transitional assistance or retention services for individuals experiencing homelessness.It was while conducting this research that I became interested in homeless material culture. The items that individuals collect, keep and dispose of, and how they how they use these items to manifest their idea of home on the spaces that they occupy.Taking this as my thesis project, which is my poster right here. Thank you.Thank you. Okay, you guys, that was amazing. Amazing. First of all, I want to say this booklet that you've created is so dense with information. It covers so many different topics that we have studied here as a counsel in our study sessions on homelessness.It talks about housing. It talks about the importance of outreach. It talks about obstacles to getting into services like the lack of identification alone, just not having an ID. What that does for individuals who want a service. This document right here is just unbelievable.I mean, I'm going through it here. You talk about some of the legal hurdles we've had, some of the changes in the law and how that's impacted our homeless population. I really think you should apply for some sort of an award for this research project because this summarizes a lot of what we see every day, and it'sjust it's just chock full of information. So thank you. This exceeds any expectation I ever had when we first partnered. I mean, it goes above and beyond. And I just have to tell you guys, I wish I wish there were more people here to hear this presentation because this is unlike anything we've seen from it, especially froma college, you know, department with student labor. So thank you. And I want to thank our homeless outreach team. I've had the opportunity and feel incredibly blessed for the continuing opportunity to be able to join the Street team on some outreach efforts.And the work that the street teams do is just unbelievable. Anytime anyone reaches out to me about a not my backyard type issue, I say, Would you like to go on a homeless ride along? Because I think once they do, it really changes their perspective about what it takes to get someone into a service.So I just I'm so impressed by this, you guys. Thank you so much. You have no idea how valuable this is going to be for us in terms of policymaking and making informed decisions based on data. So thank you.Thank you. Vice Mayor Interest. Yes.Thank you very much. First of all, I want to thank Councilwoman the price for bringing this forward to our diocese, because what I'm seeing and you guys, first of all, I just want to tell you what a tremendous job you guys have done, because sometimes when I go out and speak to individuals, especially when dealing with homelessnessand they're not homeless, and I speak in my various, you know, community groups, you talk about those people where you have put yourself in a position there to be a part of that. I have to give you kudos because the fact that I just can't even imagine what you went through to try to go to get theinformation that you have. Each and every one of you individuals, the job that you've done, it shows people that just not in the third district. Homeless is a worldwide problem. We have you. And I just want to thank Mrs. Price for bringing this forward.And I just wish we had more people here in the council to be able to see this, because you guys don't realize what a great job you're doing and the picture that you're showing to the community, to the city of Long Beach.Fantastic. And go beach. I just have to say that. Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Ringo.Thank you, Mary. And I, too, want to extend my my, um, thank you to Councilmember Price for including me in this item. I had a a meeting a couple of weeks ago with the lottery, with Wetlands Authority, and there they have, as you know, a very serious homeless problem that goes into the wetlands and in those areas. You missed that meeting. But but I was there and we had a presentation done by the Quality of life officers from that Long Beach PD there. And what they basically brought forward was the fact that it it it can become a law enforcement issue, but it's a quality of life issue.And for many of those homeless individuals that were there, their compassion and their ability to communicate with the homeless people that were there was just absolutely phenomenal. They were able to have that those 15 or 17 point of contact, but more like ten or even less because they were they showed such an amount of of humanity tothese individuals that it helped them reconnect with family, reconnect with society, get themselves cleaned up and get back into into the mainstream. And a lot of a lot of what we deal with with homelessness is not you know, we look at it as a law enforcement issue or maybe in an economic issue or socio economic issue, butit's a human issue. And if we are able to treat our fellow human beings more with more with greater sense of humanity, I think we would go a long way in addressing the homeless issues that we have in the city.But I was looking for the chief a little while ago because I want to get those names of those officers that that work in that area. Because they made a presentation that was just heartbreaking. I mean, it was it was it showed so much.Those guys really need a badge, not a badge. Merit medal for for all the work that they do out there, because they were doing phenomenal work in reaching out to these homeless people and getting them back into the into the mainstream to make them back into society.So this report here is absolutely wonderful. It basically documents what a lot of us already know. But you did the research and you did. You collected the data that just basically proves what we may already know or or perceive.And it's in it's all right here. So I agree with Councilmember Price that this could be a good policy document for us to look at and to determine what directions we want to take and where do we want to spend our money.And obviously, one thing that I can glean from this right now and how you worked already with with these other officers, is that we need to basically put a moral commitment into quality of life issues and quality of life efforts that would do a more direct outreach into the homeless community so that so we could bring inbring them back in, into society and connect them with their families and with the mainstream. So I want to thank all the work you've done. Thank you very much.Thank you, Councilwoman Mango.Excellent work. We have had the quality of life officers and the outreach team to many of our community meetings. But one of the things that I think is poignant is when a encampment is in a particular community, that's when the community adjacent is most open to understanding and listening and hearing the difference between perceptions realities.We have a lot of crossover jurisdictional issues between Long Beach City, Caltrans, L.A. County, who's in charge? When L.A. County, when Long Beach goes through to offer services. Oftentimes, they won't take the services till the day before the cleanup.How do we work on that efficiency? Is there an opportunity for us to work with, say, L.A. County so that they're noticing requirements match the adjacent city? Because one of the things that we consistently have as a challenge is as the city resource team goes around and meets with different individuals and cleans up those areas.They move to areas that have longer notice periods and then the neighbors who live adjacent to those area areas have different levels of frustration. And with that frustration comes a reduction in tolerance and compassion. And so we need to kind of be able to figure out and balance the ways in which we can interact and solve thisas a whole. So I really appreciate this. I would love a digital copy so that I can do a better job sharing this with my network and our community leaders. I think that this is a great document as a starting point, but it also love to meet with any of you or all of you about your policyrecommendations on how we could better pull together. Because I know in my district and actually in almost all of our districts, we have so many cross jurisdictional issues where it's, councilwoman, why can't you do something? And the area they're asking about is not within our jurisdiction.And then the frustration of where the funding comes from and how it can be used and what it can and can't be used for. Excellent work and we have a lot more work to do. So thank you.Thank you, Councilmember. Super now.Thanks. I'd also like to thank Councilmember Price for bringing this item forward. I agree. Just an awesome publication. Great job. I would say at the highest levels of professionalism, it's hard to believe this was done by students. I did see on page four that it's titled The Street Sharks.That has nothing to do with the new mascot for coastal languages.You know, I thought about that and I think we're all aligning here. So we're all we're all about the beach now.Okay. Well, President Connelly is going to be at my next community meeting at the end of the month. I'll make sure I point that out to her and to Teresa and Shannon, thank you for being here tonight. And we all know on the dais here how important they are.In fact, let me just say this. I never thought of your outreach team as sharks, but let's let's explore that a little bit. But the rapport with the council office is so key and because we communicate all the time.And so I just want to acknowledge that and thank you for assisting the group.And finally, Councilman Gonzalez.I just want to say thank you so much for your work. I see the methodologies that people really need to understand when we're out there reaching, you know, the most vulnerable of our populations. So thank you very much for this work.And also to Shannon and Teresa. I know you're amplifying a lot of their work. And oftentimes as a councilmember, when I'm explaining this to downtown residents, it doesn't come off very well. They're just thinking that I'm just, you know, not explaining it or they don't understand it or they don't believe me any of the above.But I think this will be a really good way to present it. And I would love to invite you to some of our meetings in downtown to just talk about this report. It would be really great to do that.Thank you very much.Thank you. Is there any other public comment outside the presentation? Please come forward.Can I get.Out? Let me go ahead, please.Let's do that.Actually, no, I mean, I meant one of the professor. Please come forward. And ma'am, please come forward also.I just want to emphasize then this. I we as a group and a department, we want to we really appreciate what it was offer to the collaboration, the partnership. It didn't cost that much, but what we gained was priceless.The experience of having our students in a real field, what we did in our class, we designed a class two way that our students, they study all of the, you know, logistic, all the city decisions, everything was happening in the city.And we went and we look at the news nationally and internationally. We let the students sit and do all the forms, one by one, to figure out what the homeless individual has to go to do good services. And then as a result of that, many of our students, our students, they presented their work in three national conference. One No national one of a student got the first prize in the post there they had in the very prestigious conference in anthropology. Well, we just want to thank all of you and say this kind of research. Basically, we are educating our students to be the agent of change in a community, and that's what we like todo. I know as educated as you are, looking forward to it to.Absolutely. Please come forward.Hello, counsel. My name is Nita Chopra. I am the community development coordinator of Mental Health America of Los Angeles.And we are based out of Long Beach here in the community. We have many.Programs targeting, you know, people of the homeless population today, which is our transitional age. Youth and even veterans actually came here specifically today to hear about the issue. I'll be anthropology department report. We have a two innovations, two grant funded projects through the Department of Mental Health that were approved this year.One is targeting transitional age youth within the Long Beach community who are homeless or at risk of being homeless. I came out here today to make you aware of this program that we have and to gain community partners going forward.Because as the anthropology department stated, it is all about connections within the community to make sure that we know of the resources that we have available to us to provide towards our.Members that we have. So I think it.I just wanted to let you know that we have our next collaborators meeting coming up next week on the 22nd at one of our community partners, the LGBT center of Long Beach. Again, this is for transitional age youth who are 18 to 25, who are homeless or at risk of being homeless, who have experienced some form oftrauma from being homeless, experienced poverty, being a LGBTQ community. And we.Also have another one that is.Our Workforce Development Innovations grant, and that is for anyone 18 and over, and that is another sector that we are doing.And it is to provide.Stabilization for people's lives going forward, not just in our services, but past our services as well. At Mental Health America, our goal is to give people a life. We don't want to just give them a service and see them out the door.We want to give them stability and we want to give them a reason to move forward. So I invite you all, encourage you all, please to come to our collaborators meeting next week on the 22nd. And again, that is 12 to 2 p.m. at the LGBT center of Long Beach.Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Brice.Thank you. I just have to end it. I want to thank Mental Health America and fact check. Cunningham from my team is going to reach out to you right now because we know that you guys also expressed an interest in our homeless work program that we're trying to roll out.So thank you for that. Thank you for all the partners to our Cal State Long Beach team. Thank you again for everything. You know what I love about this document here is a lot of time and I want to thank my colleagues.They started their comments with with a lot of thank you's, which is kind of customary. But what we do here but I just want to say there's no thanks to me. There was an opportunity for me to collaborate.And I love that this document here that you created is not political. It doesn't have a, you know, politicians logo on it. It's about you and your work product. And it's a document for us as policymakers to use.It's not any one person's initiative. It's not any one person's effort. This is something that's going to help the entire city. It's for all of us. So I brought the item tonight, but it could have been any of us.You did the work. So I want to thank you for giving us some tools. We're really lucky to have Cal State Long Beach in the city. I'm really lucky to have the university in my district and opportunities to partner on this cost us nothing.We didn't have to give money from the taxpayer dollars to commission the study. We didn't have you didn't have to have 100 people in here asking for money. You did this on your own because it's a research project that's going to enhance your students and it's going to enhance the city that the university is located in.And I wish we could have more endeavors and projects like this. So this is so positive. I'm very, very excited about it and I'm so grateful to our city staff for working with you and really driving this project.I just put it on the agenda. I didn't do any of the work. You did everything. So thank you.I think it Councilwoman. And I just wanted to close say, first of all, you guys did a great job. Amazing that this has been both graduate and undergraduate work in partnership. I think obviously you're doing this graduate level research and just really great.There's there's so many partnerships that the university has with the city, similar projects like this with other departments, whether it's engineering or the innovation work happening or with business. And so many projects where students are getting hands on experience and doing work that benefits one the city.But most importantly and I think your faculty got it exactly right, the the folks that are benefiting the most are the students that actually get to do the research that is applied. And it goes back into that classroom and that field experience that you're all getting.And so that's really exciting. And so congratulations. And with that, everyone, please cast your votes.We hope.

Recommendation to request that the City Council commemorate human rights advocate, farmworker and labor organizer Larry Itliong by declaring October 25th as Larry Itliong Day in the city of Long Beach.Councilor Marie Income.Thank you, Mayor. I want to start by thanking the members of the Human Relations Commission Civil War here today for bringing this forward. I want to also thank the contributions of Larry Itliong and coming and recommending that the city council recognize his efforts by declaring Larry Itliong day in Long Beach.Very really on with. Worker movement. Back in the 1940s and fifties, he worked long say to that Chavez during a time when Filipinos and other immigrant immigrant farmworkers were working to fight discrimination and low wages. He was a prominent leader and one of the greatest social justice movements in the United States of America.He organized a group of 1500 Filipinos to strike against grape growers of Delano, California and continued on that strike for eight days. He unified farm workers to combine forces and establish the United Farm Workers of America Organizing Committee of the AFL-CIO, which led to the United Farm Workers of America, one of the greatest unions in the historyof the nation. The unification of worker, farm, labor workers, of different ethnicities was unprecedented at that time. Setting an example for future generations of working workers and organizers and proving to be one of the reasons for the success of the American Farm Worker Farm Labor Movement.The month of October is designated as Filipino American History Month, and with a population of over 30,000 people of Filipino desert Long Beach, it is fitting to recognize Larry Itliong for his role in California and United States history.And I would like to recognize his contributions by proclaiming October 25 as Larry Itliong Day in the city of Long Beach. Thank you.Vice Mayor Richardson.Just want to thank Councilmember U. Ranga for for this gesture. I'm glad I'm happy to support it. And I know that the the Filipino migrant community played a large role in the farmworker movement. And I think it's fitting that that we go ahead and dedicate this day, October 25th, to Mr. Itliong.Thanks.Thank you. Any public comment on this item? It's going on, everybody. So I'm trying to catch my breath. I just came from the library. So my name is Jerry. Good evening. City Council and Mayor Robert Garcia.Oh, okay.Okay.So my name is Jerry Jimenez. I'm a youth organizer with Annabi and Long Beach, Filipino youth and student organization that aims to educate, organize and mobilize Filipino youth on issues that affect them every day. So since some of you all may or may not know, October is Filipino American History Month.Filipinos have always been a part of this country's history ever since. You know, they are the first to arrive from the arrival of the first Filipinos in Morro Bay, California, in the 1500s to the great fields of Delano, California, and to the Filipinos that settled here in Long Beach.Being born and raised here in Long Beach as a Filipino American, I never learned anything about my culture, my people and the contributions of Filipinos in the U.S.. So I wish that, you know, I learned about Filipino American heroes when I was younger and my whole life, you know, I learned about Cesar Chavez.And I never really knew that Filipinos had an important role in the grape strike. So it wasn't until 2012 I met the son of Larry Itliong, Johnny Itliong, and learn about how it was the, you know, the Filipino farm workers that went on strike first.So I felt empowered, you know, like like Larry Itliong. I needed to do something about, you know, the injustices and social issues that people face in the community. So since I help, you know, high school youth organize, you know, themselves at Cabrillo High, you know, we would teach them like their history and their culture and, you know, they're blown away, you know, since they haven't really learned about it in the past. So they never really you know, if Larry Itliong and the contributions of the Filipino farmworkers were recognized, all youth would get to know about the history of Filipinos here in the U.S..So, you know, the reason why it's important for you to know, you know, this history is because youth can take action on the issues that affect them today. So, you know, in light of Filipino American History Month, you know, I just wanted to come to you all today and speak about the importance of, you know, recognizing thecontributions of, you know, Larry Itliong. You know, we'd like to thank Councilmember Roberto Durango, Councilmember Jeanine Pearce and also Councilmember Rex Richardson. And, you know, for your leadership in helping honor Larry Itliong and, you know, the city of Long Beach.So, yeah, we hope to we can continue to work together to honor Filipino American History Month and the contributions of Filipinos in the city. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please.Hello. Good evening, honorable mayor and members of the City Council. My name is Miles McNeely and I'm the chair of the Human Relations Commission. I wanted to first thank Councilmember Urunga for supporting this rec recommendation and bringing this to the council.And I also want to thank other members of council for their support to support this evening. One of the functions of the Human Relations Commission is to help foster attitudes among various groups which lead to civil peace and intergroup understanding, as well as the promotion of full acceptance of all citizens in the community in all aspects ofcommunity life. And the Human Relations Commission believes that Larry Itliong labor and human rights work has had a lasting, positive impact throughout the state, the country and within our city. In this regard, if the Council supports this recommendation will be joining the state of California, the county of Los Angeles, the city of Carson, and other bodies inrecognizing their young for his human rights contributions. In 2013, Governor Brown signed Assembly Bill 123, requiring California public schools to include the contribution of Filipino Americans to the farm labor movement. And also Assembly Bill seven was passed to require California public schools to teach students about the contributions of Larry Itliong.October is Filipino American History Month, and with a population of approximately 30,000 people of Filipino descent, it is evident that the City of Long Beach is an appropriate city to follow the footsteps of other municipalities that have recognized Itliong for his contributions to California and U.S. history as a city, as the as the Long Beach City Council'sPrincipal Advisory Commission promoting better understanding among the diverse ethnic cultural groups in Long Beach. The members of the Human Relations Commission are in agreement that this is an important and appropriate action as it further promotes the ideals of human relations, human rights and equity.Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Thanks. Hi. My name is Doctor. Oh, thank you. Hi. My name is Dr. Aileen Villanueva Bernal. And I mean 1364 Grand Avenue. And I proudly represent the fourth District. And I'm currently faculty at Cal State Long Beach. And I also work with the Office of the Chancellor.And I want to take a moment to speak about the personal impact of having a Larry Itliong day. When I was 21, I had my first significant job. I was I was so excited to tell my mom, my mom, mom, I'm working 32 hours a week at this engineering firm for like ten bucks an hour.And I'm like, okay, you know, exciting, right? And my mom's like, you know why they're keeping you at 32 hours a week, right? And I'm like, Seymour and and she's like, well, you know, it's probably because they don't want to make you full time and give you benefits.It's like, oh, and she was like, Are you part of a union? And the mother was like, Yeah, are you part of a union? And I was like, No. But you know, long story short, you know, my parents were very instrumental in me as far as my work ethic and as far as, you know, labor rights andwhat we deserve as a Filipino community in our struggles and our challenges. My parents, my my dad used to work at the naval base here before it closed down. My mom used to work as a food caterer and Lex and so they would work graveyard and everything.And then so they can make it to my science stuff, you know, my science projects and everything. And my one event that I'm remembering is I had won second place in a Why I Want to be an Engineer essay contest when I was 14 at Cal State Long Beach.And that's where I am today teaching chemistry. So I feel like with this day, everything sort of come full circle. So I thank you for the council, for your support in recognizing the state. Thank you.Thank you. Let me just add a couple of just words, then I pass it off to Councilman Andres. So I just think it's important to note that the Long Beach Greater Long Beach area has about 35,000 Filipino Americans that actually live in the area.This is actually a significantly large population. A lot of people don't realize that. I'm particularly in West Palm Beach and parts of the western part of the city. We have a very large community that's been here for a very long time that if you looked and you trace back to where the Filipino movement began, and particularly inLong Beach, you can trace it all the way back to their service in during the World Wars, particularly if you look back at what happened with the Navy here in Long Beach, you had a huge contingent of Americans that were part of the Navy as well that settled into Long Beach before and and during those days.And they still reside here to this very day. So if you think about Long Beach and Carson and the communities around Long Beach, West Long Beach and Carson, that's where you have this very large concentration of of the Filipino community.So I think it's great that this proclamation has come forward. We began honoring the Filipino-American History Month a few years ago in the city of Long Beach. It's something we should always continue to do and recognize the incredible work and the history that phillip filipino americans have contributed, including their amazing food to Long Beach.Councilman Andrews Yes, fine. Thank you, Mia. First of all, I'd really like to thank Councilman you for bringing this item forward because I think it is very important that we recognize our leaders who fight and continue to fight for equal rights.So I truly support this. And one of the bigger things, because the fact that my son in law, he's married, no, that's my daughter. She's married to a Filipino. He is a dean over to Poly High School. And the only word that I've learned since she's been married to him for ten years now, it's still a guy. So you guys don't know what that means? That means. Are you serious?So thank you.Thank you. Seeing that there is a guy.I know, Salamat Po.That's correct. Q And if you all have not haven't been to any of these Filipino senior Civic American Club dances and coronations are like the best that you can go to. By the way, I hopefully you guys had a chance to go to some of these if you guys have been there.Awesome. So with that, please cast your votes.Moesha carries.We're going to actually take a photo real quick. The guys want to come down to to.Yes. Thank you. Mm hmm. Yeah. Yes, I've got. Thank you. I wasn't sure if I'm.Going to be there tomorrow.There was nothing. I'll do Facebook.Great. Thank you and thank you again. Also, just a shout out to our Human Relations Commission, which is very active. So thank you guys for being so active as well. And with that, we have our second public comment period for those who haven't spoken the first time.If there's any. See none. Or is that. No. Okay. See? None. So we're going to close that. And with that, without objections, I we conclude the meeting or we're going to go and finish up. Closed session.

For a ten year term renewable for two successive ten year terms, the committee recommends the bill pass.Thank you, Councilmember O'Brien.This was this is a parcel on 85th, just west of Greenwood. It's across the street from the Fred Meyer up in Greenwood. The folks are aware of that. There's a new project being developed. It's a more mixed use development on the south side of 85th as part of that development.That developer of their own accord went out and commissioned some art to be done and that art installation. The intent is that will be installed on the sidewalks when the public right away they came to the council, I believe it was last year to get preliminary approval of the concept and we approve that.Now they are back there, I believe, ready to install that piece of art. This would allow them to essentially rent that space and the public right away, the annual fee. It's a relatively modest footprint that the art will take up and the rent is about $140 a year.This ordinance has a ten year lease and then they can do that renewed twice for two additional ten year periods. I just want to comment that I think it's great to see private developers incorporating public art into their projects.And when someone has thoughtfully decided to do public art, even in public right away, I believe this is an instance that the public will significantly benefit from at no cost to the public. The private developer is bearing the cost of both the art and the lease of this public space.Thank you. Councilman Bryant, any comments from any colleagues? Councilmember Herbold.Just a question. So this is not something that was that came out of design review. This is something that they just decided that they want to do themselves.I don't believe it was a requirement of the design review process, but it may have been that design review looked at that comprehensively as part of the building. I don't recall that person.Do you. Do you know what the art is? Sorry. Do you know what the art is?Do I know what it is? Yeah, I can kind of define it. It's like a tripod of three things.Art.What's that? What is art? Oh, do we have an hour? Because I could really go into this. No, we don't. We do not.Have. However, I would say counter to council member, the artist that was commissioned has done one piece, I believe it was in Discovery Park already, and this is sort of a second piece. We had a really good presentation at the committee where we outlined what it looked like, but unfortunately that wasn't attached.But it is a beautiful sort of two story structure that I think I was past there this weekend. I think is going to compliment the area very well and I'd echo your comments. Councilmember Bryant, it's great to see private development taking an interest in more public art.Absolutely. I think it has a kind of a tripod footprint, so with the majority installed on top. And so the actual footprint on public property is relatively modest. But it's a you know, it's art. I'm not going to comment on the specifics of the art value to it.I'll let others with more expertize say that.I think that description was what I was looking for.Thank you for the save.

Please. Because of the Iranian announced the results. One nay, one abstention. 11. Nice. 11 is council bill 545 has passed. Up next, we have 20 dash 0550. A bill for an ordinance changing the zoning classification for 516 Newton Street in Farnham.Council members say to Barker, Will you please put Council Bill 550 on the floor for passage?I move that council bill 550 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.Dagen.Very good. The required public hearing for council bill 20 0550 is open. May we have the staff report, please?Yeah. So you guys can see my screen and hear me okay?Mm hmm. Yes.I'm Libby Kizer with CPD, and I'll be presenting a rezoning request for 516 Newton STS to allow for an EDU. Okay. This is in City Council District three in the Burnham neighborhood, and this is the first aid request in the neighborhood.The property is located south of the Sixth Avenue Freeway on Newton Street. Its approximately 6000 square feet and is currently occupied by a single unit dwelling. The properties in the urban edge single unit de zone district and the applicant is proposing to rezone to urban edge single unit de one x to allow for an edu the esud1x requires a minimum lot size of 6000 square feet and allows for the urban house, suburban house and detached accessory dwelling unit building forms. The maximum height for a house is 30 to 35 feet and 24 feet for a detached adu.The subject property and most of those in the vicinity are zoned e. S. U. D x. However, approximately 70% of the Burnham neighborhood is zoned esu de one x and already allows the use. The site is occupied by a single unit dwelling as mentioned, and is surrounded by mostly other single unit uses.As shown in these photos, the subject property and those in the immediate vicinity contains single storey houses on front, loaded lots with generous setbacks. This application has followed the typical rezoning process. The planning board hearing was held on June 3rd and the application was unanimously recommended for approval.As of the present, two public comments have been received opposing the rezoning because of increased density and visual impacts. To approve the rezoning, it must be found that the requested MAP amendment is consistent with five criteria found in the jungle zoning code.The first criteria is that the rezoning request must be consistent with adopted plans, and there are four plans that apply to this rezoning, including Comp Plan 2040 Blueprint, Denver Housing and Inclusive, Denver and the Farnham West Farnham Neighborhood Plan of 1986.The rezoning request is consistent with the comprehensive plan, as it would allow for an additional housing option within one mile of a light rail station in an established neighborhood consistent with three strategies in the equitable, affordable and inclusive vision elements.In addition, the proposed rezoning would allow infill development that broadens the range of housing types available in an area where infrastructure and services already exist, consistent with the strong women centric neighborhoods vision element as well as the environmentally resilient vision elements.The rezoning request is also consistent with Blueprint Denver. The subject property is mapped as part of the urban edge neighborhood context, which is described as containing predominantly residential uses with single and two unit low scale homes on short walkable blocks.In Blueprint under the future places MAP designates the subject property as a low residential place type, which generally contains single and two unit uses and its use are appropriate. Newton Street is characterized as a local or on designated street, which generally contains residential uses.At the ludy meeting, Councilwoman Torres had a question regarding how residential low guidance was applied to this case, and this guidance doesn't specifically mention ADOS, but rather focuses on the appropriateness of rezoning from a single unit district to a two unit district.However, in the definition of low in an urban edge context, it states that 80 use are appropriate where compatible, and in this case an ad would be compatible as the unit would be located on the rear of the lot and wouldn't impact the character of the surrounding area.As far as blueprints, numbers, growth strategy, the property is in all other areas of the city category where 10% of future jobs and 20% of future housing are desired. This is the least intensive growth category. Blueprint also includes specific policy recommendations.Housing policy number four talks about diversifying housing choice through the expansion of accessory dwelling units throughout all residential areas, and this rezoning would help achieve this in the meantime. The proposed rezoning is also consistent with housing and inclusive.Denver, which encourages expanding the development of accessory dwelling units to incentivize affordable and mixed use housing and to help low and moderate income homeowners build wealth. Finally, the Burnham Burnham Last Neighborhood Plan of 1986 applies to the subject property, and the rezoning would help implement four of the plan's goals, including stabilizing or upgrading existing housing, maintaining theneighborhood's character and the quality of residences, and encouraging no new low density housing. Staff concludes the requested zoning meets criteria. Number one, consistency with adopted plans. Staff also finds that the requested zoning meets the next two criteria, as it will result in uniformity of district regulations and will further the public health, safety and welfare primarily through itsimplementation of adopted plans. The justifying circumstance for this rezoning is a city adopted plan since the approval of the existing ESU de Zone District. The city has adopted the Comprehensive Plan 2040 Blueprint, Denver and Housing and Inclusive Denver.As stated throughout this presentation, the proposed rezoning meets the intent of these plans. Overall, the proposed rezoning is consistent with the urban edge neighborhood context that exists in the surrounding area and the purpose and intent of the ESU de one s district thus meeting the fifth criteria.In conclusion, CPD recommends approval based on finding all review criteria have been met. The applicant and I are available for questions.Thanks, Libby. Tonight, council has not received any written testimony on Council Bill 20 Dash 0550 and we have zero individuals signed up to speak. Questions from members of council. Councilwoman Sandoval.Yes. Thank you, Madam President. So, Libby, I have a question for you. In your presentation, you mentioned the ADA being at the back of the law. Is it required to be at the back of the lot in the zone district or can they have a different type of accessory drilling unit in the zone district?Because I wasn't familiar with ones that are fully require the unit to be at the back of it.But it is my understanding that it would have to be on the rear 35% of the lot and detached from the primary structure.So he can't have a basement one.I don't think it could be attached. But let's see. I believe it's just the detached accessory dwelling unit.Building form where you double check that and and you don't have to get it tonight. But will you double check that?Absolutely. Yeah.Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.Thank you, Councilman Flynn.Thank you, Madam President. Just a curious. Because I was looking. Virtually since we're not going out. But I. I was looking at this one along with the other rezonings, and I noticed that on the back part of the what I offer the alley, there is a six foot privacy fence that is.Looks like it, maybe about 35% into the back of the lot. And it sort of marks off the back yard from the portion where the aid would go. And I'm curious if someone if the owners here, Libby, maybe you could explain why that is.It's actually the shed that's behind the house is now part of what's fenced off onto the alley. And I'm just curious about does the do you have to have access from the front, from the primary street? Is it necessary that access from the alley?And do we know why that six foot fence is there? It apparently doesn't have from the image, it doesn't look like it has a gate in it.And the applicant to be available who could maybe answer that configuration a little better than I could.And I'm sorry, there is there is a gate there by the shed. I'm just curious, because I've never seen this before.Right or. Getting the applicant in.I'm Ben Holtzman. Can you guys hear me okay? Yes. Thank you. Great. Thank you. When me and my wife purchased this property, that fence had already been built there. In the middle, there is a gate in the back.And I believe the intention of whoever built it was just to have extra parking in the back. So we do have parking in the front on the driveway and then two or three spaces in that space in the back.And that I guess having the fence there is what gave me the idea to get it back there.Okay. Excellent. Okay. Thank you. I would point out that it's not paved, so you can't actually park on it. So I mean, a better use as an aid to you. Thank you.All right. Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Torres.Thank you, Madam President. Hi, Benjamin. How are you?Well, how about you?Good. I didn't. I don't think I asked this question when it was in committee. But do you plan to rent it or is it for family use?And I would. Probably. Well, I haven't determined that yet. Probably mostly rental. Occasionally family. But it's kind of a long way off in determining exactly how I'm going to build it. Okay. No immediate plans to build it anyway, I think, especially after COVID.I'm going to have to save up for quite some time.So we have we have a new one that just came up at the end of our alley. If you want to see some that.Have recently been built, give us a call.But just wanting to make sure that, you know, because this was a question in terms of neighbors who opposed it, if you rent it, you're the primary occupants. Right. So you're not planning to move.Correct. We are the primary occupants.Okay.Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.All right. Thank you. See no other questions. The public hearing for Council Bill 20 dash 0550 was closed. Comments by members of council. Councilwoman Torres.Thank you so much, Madam President.I know that they referenced a 1986 neighborhood plan.It's one of the oldest ones that we have in District three, and we're currently going.Under going over the west area plan to update Barnum, Burnham, West and other neighborhoods in West Denver.But some of those.Values.That were mentioned by Libby are still pretty consistent folks wanting to keep single housing character. But what it does offer nowadays is an option to stay in the.Neighborhood as a property.Owner.And any use.Providing that gentle density is.One of the things that we do support.I do support and our office does.Barnum.70%, 80 use. We haven't seen at least zoned for 80 years.We haven't seen too many getting built.Libby I'm not sure if that has come up for, for, for you all at all. But even those that are zoned, I haven't seen too many site development.Plans come through.So with that, with the option, we are still finding folks really wanting to enter into this.Space and we.Want to encourage them to do that.So I appreciate this application and look forward.To supporting it and my other council.Members for their support.

Counsel Bill 1292 on the floor.Yes, I moved the council bill 18, Dash 1290 to be ordered published.Thank you, Councilman Cashman. It has been moved and seconded questions or comments by members of Council Councilman Flynn. You called this one up?Yes, Mr. President, I did. In the three years that I've been sitting up here and indeed looking back on the probably 30 years I used to sit over there, I can't recall an issue on which I have struggled.As much as I struggled trying to come to terms with this one, because this is literally life and death. And I recognize that and I respect that. There are just so many moving parts. To the issue of supervised use facilities.And I haven't been able to settle yet on whether I believe I truly believe that this approach will be effective. Or the best way to proceed, as opposed to some other methods I've seen elsewhere. And as I did more research, I came to believe that it would be really good for this city to provide.To its citizens, not just to its first responders, but to family members and to citizens and to volunteers. Naloxone kits or Narcan kits. And to have them volunteer or even in their own family, to go out into the community where we are finding.Overdose deaths. I had one right around the corner from my office in the Bear Valley Shopping Center. A woman in it was found in a car after three weeks in an abandoned car. So this is this hits real close to home to me.I've also had a heroin bust of a dealer right outside my office in Bear Valley. This hits real close to me as well. And while I was considering whether this other approach might be more effective as I'm watching television last night after the news, 60 Minutes came on and detailed the this very program in Salt Lake City, this program of distributing naloxone kits to the general population and the effect it's having on saving lives there, as opposed to establishing a single site here where the government will then sponsor you in in safely injecting your opioids or your meth or whatever substance.And so I'm still so unsettled, not just on the matters of law, the state law, which still doesn't allow that may change in the next session. And I understand that this bill is contingent on that passing, but also the issue of federal federal law and whether this runs afoul of federal law.We know that the Justice Department believes that it does. And so, Mr. President, at this point, I know that there are votes here to pass this, but I intend to be probably the sole no vote on this, because I'm not convinced that this is the best approach for this city.The deciding factor for me was a recent article in Vancouver where they've run a site like this for 15 years, and in the year 2017, Vancouver set a record for overdose deaths after 15 years of having such a facility.The problem in Vancouver was I think it was 48% more deaths in 2017 than in 2016. And this is after 15 years of this approach. So I'm not persuaded that a government sanctioned injection facility is a better approach than having a community full of volunteers who go where the problem is, who go to the Cherry Creek bikepath or the central library. In the Central Library, they've had.21.Overdoses reversed by the security teams down there since about the last year and a half. And I think that would be a much better approach than to set up a facility like this. Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Councilwoman Sussman.Thank you, Mr. President. I am in support of this bill, and I just think that it's really important for us to take a real realized reality. People are going to be doing this and people are going to be doing this on our streets.If we pretend that it's not happening, it's not going to go away. And we we are known.In Denver for doing some very bold.Things. And even though it I don't really want to compare them, we win against federal government for marijuana. Again, sort of looking at reality. What is the reality here? And I think with the safe injections, we can at least prevent some deaths.I actually want to sort of like Councilman Flynn was talking about. I'd like to also think about the deaths that that we might prevent that aren't about public injection, but the deaths of people inside their homes, the sort of the invisible addicts, the ones that are taking the pills.And certainly the 60 Minutes article last night talked a great deal about that. Here I am already. We haven't passed this one and I'm piling on. What can we what can we do next to to understand the reality of the situation?We have to be grown up about this and what can we do? And I feel like this is a really important step. If it doesn't work, I suppose we'll learn how to make it work. And we wouldn't never learn how to make it work if we didn't try this this particular path to helping folks who are strugglingwith this disease. This is a disease. Thank you very much, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Councilman Brooks.Yeah, thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, everybody, that's here. And thank you for being a part of this journey and teaching this entire city what's going on in the dark. Councilman Flynn mentioned some issues. This is a hard decision for him.If this is an easy decision for you and you are supportive of this, please stand up. Thank you. All of these individuals here are in our community and they have personally witnessed the hard stuff that we've been thinking about for the last.Well, that I've been thinking of for the last year and a half, but that we've been contemplating for the last four weeks. And this is a public health crisis that we're in and we're bringing it to the light.And I am supportive of this. I do feel like we've waited long enough and it's time that we address this issue. Councilman Flynn, let me just address two things that you said that are a little bit inaccurate. One, the government is not sponsoring this.This actually is going to be privately run. A nonprofit will run this. That's in the bill. Number two, Vancouver is one, but 60 cities internationally that have data in context. And so to just look at that and not look at the other cities like a Barcelona, which I've mentioned this many times, the day one that they've openedup a supervised use site. Dramatically. They saw a drop in deaths and they're continuing to see a drop in deaths. And so it's important that you look at the data per the context that you're in. Last thing I'll say is we have no good American data.That's why we're asking for this pilot. And here tonight, we do have a state senator who will help us take this to the next level. And I'd love. Mr.. Mr. President, if you indulge me for about 3 minutes, to have State Senator elect Brittany Patterson come and just share a little bit, because I believe she's for thetitle for this bill at the state. And I think we need to hear about that at the city. Is that okay, Mr. President?Yup. Go ahead.Hello, everybody. It's great to be here. I've never actually testified, so I apologize if I didn't go. Don't actually do the right rules and I call you by the right title. I am currently state representative. I was just elected to enter the state senate.I have pulled a bill and I just wanted to come here to thank you for taking this initiative because Denver, actually showing that they want to move forward with a pilot program is going to be an essential step in us actually taking action at the state level.I feel very confident with the change in leadership that will actually get a fair hearing this time and that this will be a bipartisan bill. I know that this is an uncomfortable issue to talk about. It is something that we don't want to recognize is happening.But I can tell you that whether or not we pass this pilot program and whether or not we pass this at the state level, people are going to continue to use and inject drugs and they are going to continue to die.In fact, we saw the highest overdose rates last year in the highest death toll that we've had here in Colorado. And we expect it to continue to rise here and nationally. We've been told by experts that it's going to get worse before it gets better.And to Councilman Flynn, what happened in Vancouver is actually because it wasn't because of the safe you cite, it was because right now they're actually having a surge of fentanyl. And so we've met with with professionals. I had the opportunity to visit Vancouver and the the police officers that we were in contact with said that heroin doesn'teven exist there anymore because they get such a a greater high from fentanyl. So that's actually where the skyrocket of deaths is happening. So what we have the opportunity to do right now is to make history in making sure that we are treating people with an addiction, with the care that they need, that we're bringing them outof the shadows for people that are injecting drugs. This has been a long journey. You don't just start using heroin. I know my mom was overprescribed. Opioids, like so many people here in Colorado and across the United States, she was a soccer mom.We were in the middle class. She is an amazing person. This is this affects everybody. I mean, I'm telling her story because the greatest barrier that I have found to actually getting people the help that they need is the stigma that exists.And when we talk about even this site, it is it is uncomfortable for people to talk about. So I want to tell you about my mom. She was overprescribed opioids. Like so many people, she had a back problem.We've seen a system that has incentivized overprescribing. That's why right now we are facing a public health crisis. We are facing the greatest public health crisis of our time. And you happened to be elected during this time. And it is incumbent upon all of us to act.And this is one measure in ensuring that we're actually keeping people alive that have gone down the path. 80% of people who use and inject drugs started off with prescription opioids like my mom. So when you think about that journey that has led them to the point where they became wildly addicted, like my mom, so many peopleare getting cut off of their prescription without access to treatment because right now we're trying to ramp up actually getting them the help that they need. But we need to make sure that we're keeping them alive today. I when you are injecting drug injecting drugs, it's very isolating.So a lot of these people, the point of having a pilot program to have these super supervised sites is actually bring them out of the shadows in front of health professionals that are not only going to ensure that when they're using drugs, they're not overdosing, but also building those relationships, having a room where they can sit, getthey're making sure that we are testing them for hepatitis C, for HIV, making sure that when they're ready to get help, that we actually give them the prescription that they need for medication assisted treatment. And then ultimately, when they're ready to move towards our.Recovery, that they have those relationships intact and that we're actually building capacity there to get them the treatment that they need. So my mom has been addicted to drugs for 30 years. She was cut off when her doctor recognized she had a problem.And she, like so many people, was just trying to stay well. It wasn't about getting high. It was about making sure that she was not going through withdrawal. People who are addicted say that withdrawal is they fear withdrawal more than death.So when you think about the physical pain that that must be that you fear going through that more than death. So they will do anything to stay well. And that's why so so many people have moved to injecting drugs, to buying cheap heroin on the street.And we've seen an increase in fentanyl here as well. So you have an incredible opportunity to move forward to show Colorado that we are not going to increase the amount of crime in this area. In fact, it's been proven to do the opposite, that we are going to save lives and that we are going to actually getpeople to help that they need. This is going to really change. Be an example for Colorado. And I just want to thank thank you for the opportunity to speak to you. Thank you for taking this up. This is this is critical for the United States and for Colorado.Thank you. Councilman Brooks, was that all you.Had a follow up at the end? Okay.Thank you very much, Councilman Cashman.Thank you, Mr. President. I agree with Councilman Flynn on a couple of areas. I'd like to see Naloxone much more readily available in the community. I think that makes great sense. And I also agree that I don't know that this is the right solution for Denver.What I do know is that we have no drug treatment beds available in the Denver area. I know that we don't have a functioning mental health system in the Denver area outside our jail system. We have like 98 or 90 beds at Denver Health for both mental health and drug treatment.For a city of 700,000 and a metro area, somewhere around 3 million are allowing people to die in restaurant bathrooms and in our parks and on the street has not slowed the the opioid epidemic. And as Mr. Patterson said, you know, the landscape changes continually.Now it's fentanyl. Who knows what else is going to be appearing for me? And I totally understand the difficulty that many people are have having wrapping their minds around providing a facility for people to inject. Illegal drugs. I get that it's difficult for me to wrap my mind around it, but we need to try something to stemthe tide. As as my friend Lisa Revell says all the time, we can't get someone into treatment when they're dead. You know. While while the country is getting off its lazy behind to take care of the mentally ill and to take care of people suffering from the disease of addiction, we owe it to to our community todo something to keep keep things going until we can give them the care that they need. So I'll be voting to move this forward. Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Cashman. Councilman Espinosa.I watched I watched the 60 minute piece and what was happening there were an 80 $80 drug was being put to market at $4,000 is appalling. And I hope that companies commitment to bringing that drug price back down is fall through.And I hope that people maybe all of you will write in Visio and make sure that that drug, which there's their mechanism for delivery, is far simpler than anything else on the market and could be readily administered by people, the layperson.There's no reason why in America that isn't the standard protocol for how we deliver this drug. That said, the life saving ability of naloxone is proven. And I can tell you, if one life is saved in the supervised use facility, the facility is paid for.And so that as tangible as that is, the only reason I mean, that isn't the only reason I supported supervised use facilities. From the moment Councilman Brooks approached me on this and I've never wavered on that is because it's not just the life saved in the facility.When you're present and able to address that, it's the other aspects that are tangible from this side of the dais in delivering services to this community is you will get fewer overdose deaths because those lives are saved, you will get fewer ambulance calls for overdoses.When I went on my one ride along with with the FDA and I'm sort of maybe violating hip rules, we went on one of those calls. I've never experienced that. And it was it was eye opening. And and that's midday on a on a on a Friday.That's not the hot spot for when those things are. But it happens on a routine basis in this city. The decrease in transmitted diseases that are transmitted by by dirty needles and things like that, all of those have major consequences to our our ability as a city to deliver services to populations that need them.And so this is actually the step in the right direction. And and so thank you, Councilman Brooks. Thank you all for supporting council in in doing what is is is a bit a bit too progressive for some, but it's the right thing for this city.And and I'm happy to be supporting it. Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Lopez.Thank you, Mr. President. I am a yes vote. This is this is very easy to me when the question was asked me about it. And this was absolute. Yes. And for a couple of reasons. And one is in this country, we are absolutely backwards.We are backwards when it comes to drug treatment. We are backwards when it comes to medicine. We are backwards when it comes to health care. We are an industrialized nation and we are an incredibly powerful nation and a wealthy nation.Yet we do not. You have more access to illicit and pharmaceutical drugs than you do to medicine to treat it. And when it comes to when it comes to treating it, we create all these barriers. We don't we don't believe it's a function of government to treat it.We don't believe I mean, we believe it's a it's a privilege and not a right. Collectively, there is something wrong with that. And so we are in we of course, we're going to be afraid of it. Of course we're going to be fearful and nervous about it if we haven't been exposed to how to actually treated.And in order to do that, you have to leave stateside and go across the world to see how they're treating it. And we have to learn from other countries. We have to learn from other, you know, other governments that are doing this right.I do believe this is absolutely worth it. I don't want to see somebody overdose pass away anywhere in a park or in a bathroom, anywhere or even in a facility. And this you know, this is an opportunity to go in that right direction.It's more than just a test. We know that this is proven. And when when we put our our resources and we behind it, and we do believe it is our function. Right. And so finally, I think I would imagine that.If you are in one of these sites, you have access to not just sterile, sterile needles and people there who are supervising you and know what to do just in case, but also because you have someone to talk to.And that person, that interaction could be that interaction that gets them on that right path. So you know what? Maybe I shouldn't do this. You think I should do this? It's up to you. It's a survival rate. I mean, you have those conversations.Think about those conversations. And how those in and of themselves are life saving. And that's what we want. Access to care. Access. That is so easy. Yes. On this one. Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilman. Thank you. Guzman-Lopez Councilwoman Black.Thank you, Mr. President. I wasn't going to say anything tonight because this is just first reading and it will be back up next week. But since everybody is talking, I thought I should put in my $0.02 worth. I agree with all of the things that have been said for the reasons why we should have this and itis a crisis and there are no solutions. And so for those reasons, I am in favor of it. However, I do agree with Councilman Flynn's concerns. So there are two things that are really important to me. One is that there is treatment available and that it will connect people to treatment.And I said that in committee, someone Cashman said it tonight, we don't have enough treatment, so we've got to work on that. The other thing is the fact that it's a pilot and we need data and we need real data.And I think it will be hard to collect because it's a changing landscape if there's more fentanyl coming in. I don't know how you collect that data, but we need to have real data so that we can look back and see how successful it was or it wasn't.So without those two features, I would not be supporting it. But as of now I am in support of it. And thank you for your work, Councilman Brooks, and everyone, for being here tonight.Thank you, Councilwoman Black, Councilwoman Cannick.Thank you. I, too, want to thank Councilman Brooks for his not just sponsorship, but leadership on this issue and to the community. That also is leading example of code governing, where you work together to challenge and take on a challenge.I guess for me, I just was thinking about the comments about this being a disease and I think about what if it was kidney disease and people were trying to treat themselves with their own dialysis and they were dying in the alley because they'd done it wrong?Or what if it was cancer and they were, you know, self administering in no other disease model do we leave folks to fend for themselves. And so the difference between this and the other diseases is the stigma, right?That's the stigma and the misunderstanding that the point at which addiction occurs, it becomes medical. It's it's a physical dependency. It's not a weak moral character. And in this particular set it well in some of the drugs, not all the introduction drugs, but in the case of heroin, what we know is that people actually need medicine inmany cases because they can die from quitting or they can die from the process of trying to wean themselves off in their tolerance changing. And so I agree, we need more treatment. We also need, you know, medically assisted treatment in the form of replacement methadone or the other the other types of replacements that are available to makethis a safer transition, because in this case, the transition off can be can be dangerous as well. So thank you to my colleague for pointing out the medical nature of this situation. And I think the second thing that resonates with me is Councilman Espinoza's point about one life.And so I think that there's, you know, several ways to think about data. And I think that a simple comparison of whether or not deaths are dropping or not is not an accurate scientific model. The way that you have to do this is you have to ask the question of bending the curve so it's not did feweror more people die since supervised injection, but did fewer people die than would have died without it? And so you will know that from from the the potential reversals or from the community that's being served compared to a control group, for example, that's not being served.So there's a couple of different ways that I believe good, good professors and good researchers could could structure this, but it will never be a more or less situation because, again, it's one site. We can't put the expectation of eliminating addiction in a community on one site.So we have to have realistic evaluation methods. And so if we have those, I think we'll have a really informed discussion. So so with that, I feel like this is the right next step. I appreciate having our state leaders here and I imagine this will be an ongoing dialog with them.The one other thing I will say is the federal government, the appointees who serve in the federal government are not always right in the law. That has been proven numerous times, including cases that this very city has been engaged in regarding their interpretations of federal law where cities have prevailed.So while it's important for us to consider the federal legal landscape, it is not beyond this administration to overread or under read the law. And they have been corrected on numerous occasions. And so I think that it's important for us to do what is right to legally research and evaluate it and then to be bold enough tounderstand that we won't be threatened by our beds. Beds are not legal opinions from judges. They are the opinions of one individual in a newspaper. And so it's important that we be strong, thoughtful and not shy away from a good, important debate, even if it involves some legal questions down the road.So with that, I will strongly be supporting this tonight, and I wish our community luck with the process of considering this. Should we have the legislation we need at the state to move forward? Thank you.Thank you. Councilwoman, can each. Councilwoman Ortega.Thank you, Mr. President. I, too, will be. This tonight is, as you all heard, once the state takes action. Then our Board of Environmental Health will engage in this process to figure out, you know, are we looking at one or are we looking at more than one?What are the criteria? All of that stuff that would need to be put into place. And I know that will be a public that will include a very public process. So I'm very comfortable with with that sort of next step phase of where it goes.The one thing I do want to mention, having received a letter from an adjacent property owner to the existing site, there have been concerns expressed about some of the issues around the current site that are related to just safety is one of the things that is being expressed.They have an apartment building that has the highest vacancy rate because of its close proximity to this site. Now, he does mention that there is a homeless shelter close by as well and is indicating that it's just I don't know if it's the individuals that are hanging out outside of the facility and in this alley that they'reconcerned about. But how we do the operations at any location that is selected is going to be really important to being a good neighbor to the adjacent community, because with any of our operations, whether it's a liquor store or a marijuana facility, these are issues our neighborhoods scream at all of us about and want to make surethat we're helping ensure that we have a safe community for everybody. So we want it safe for the people who are utilizing the facility, for sure. But we also want to make sure it's a safe facility for the adjacent community, and that will all be part of that environmental health process when after the state legislature takes actionand we are able to then move forward with the first ever safe injection site in the city of Denver. So I will be supporting this. Thank you.Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega, Councilman Gilmore.Thank you, President Clark. You know, the stigma that's associated with addiction treatment and recovery is really is very real. And by us taking a first step to start normalizing the conversation, I think is very important. And we need to make sure that we're protecting the safety of those who are struggling with addiction, their families, and also residentsand business owners. And so my ask is, if this does pass tonight, that we have a plan in place to have a robust community engagement, education and dialog with our constituents and with the Denver community. So we make sure that any rulemaking that is undertaken by the Board of Public Health and Environment is informed by the communityas well. And so that's my main ask, but also thank you to Councilman Brooks for including in the bill, language distribution of fentanyl testing strips as well. The only other piece that is a little concerning to me, but but I think we can get beyond it is that there won't be any report back or evaluation until afterthe 24 months that period. And I would ask that if the state legislature does act and pass into law some version that would allow this that we come back because we probably will then need to have bend amend this bill language that we include something that would update it that would have at least an annual report backto City Council Committee just so that we can continue the conversation so that it's not a one and done, but that where are we going and where are those additional treatment options that we're going to need in the city to address this?And I know that this is. It's a difficult barrier, honestly, for some community residents to get beyond. But when I look out at all of you and I look at my community, we're talking about sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, grandparents.We're we're talking about our Denver community. And so right now, we need to make that our first priority, their safety and reducing the harm that they're doing. And so with that, I will be supportive of this, wanting to make sure that we have a robust community engagement and education going forward.Thank you, President Clark.Thank you, Councilwoman Gilmore. Councilman Brooks, you want to.Say, you know what, Mr. President, I just wanted to just wrap up. I want to thank everybody for their comments. And clearly, you know, their engagement. I think a lot of the council members have been emailing me, emailing Lisa Revelle, emailing the administer the administration, Kirsten, who's helped us draft this.And I just really appreciate that you guys have gotten in there and you've educated yourself on this issue. Let me just bring up one more point that no one really talked about. And we 100% agree with the opioid plan that the mayor proposed.It talks about prevention, treatment and harm reduction. This is a clear piece that needs to be a part of it, of harm reduction. There are many people who don't understand the full scope of what we're talking about, so they would just focus on this small portion of a pilot.We believe in the entire scope of what we need to do in the city of Denver prevention, treatment and harm reduction. There are tremendous problems in treatment. There are tremendous barriers that we need to remove. But if when we're talking about this, please talk about it in the totality of the vision of what we're trying to accomplishin our city. The other thing, and I know Lisa Ravel from Harm Reduction will love that I'm mentioning this, that their organization received a Good Neighbor Award from the chair neighborhood. So I know that Councilman. Councilwoman Ortega. You heard that.But, John, neighborhood does not give those things out lightly. And so these folks with Lisa's group have been in the community connecting with neighbors, picking up needles, really a great neighborhood partner. And so I just want to give you that little shout out with that.Mr. President, this is the first reading. We're going to come back next week for the second reading. But it sounds like we have a good super majority of our council folks support. And I'll also say I have added all of your suggestions into the bill, added the mayors suggestions into the Bears.So we will be receiving his support and signing this bill. And so if there are other conversations that you guys need to have, please let me know this week. Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Brooks, thank you for taking the lead on this. Madam Secretary. Raquel.Flynn now.Black guy.CLARKE I'm sorry.BROOKS Hell, yeah.Aspirin. Espinosa.I.Gilmore. I Herndon.I Cashman.I can h.Lopez All right.Ortega Hi.Assessment. Hi. Mr. President.Hi. I'm secretary.

I do have a big favor to ask. There are a lot of you in here. If you all stand up right now and go for the exit and start talking to each other, we're not going be ableto get to recess. We have about 2 minutes worth of possibly very boring things to do, but just 2 minutes if possible. If you could just hang tight and then at recess I'll get up and go. If you absolutely have to go, please hold your conversations.Even when you're in the hall, we can hear you and we just need to get through a few more things before we can get to recess so that we can get set up for the public hearings and the folks who are here for that today.\nSummary:", "answer": "A bill for an ordinance authorizing a supervised use site pilot program contingent upon the state General Assembly passing legislation authorizing the operation of supervised use sites in the state of Colorado. \r\nThe Committee approved filing this item at its meeting on 11-7-18."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nWe will look forward to seeing you two weeks from today. Excellent. Thank you very much. Thank you, colleagues. We're going to move quick for a minute. As I said, we're going to take the Landmarks Commission next item on your agenda, items ten, 11 and 12.I'll turn it over. We have three appointments to the Landmarks Commission to hand over briefly to Ms. Crackles office for a staff report.Thank you, Mr. Chair. Good morning, Council members. Leah crackles off the council staff materials for this item for the items ten through 12 begin on page 41 of your packet. The items were confirm appointments to the King County Landmarks Commission.For Adam, also Brooke Deen, alias and Candace Parker, Barbara Brooks, Tucker, me, all of whom are here today. Jennifer Meissner, the King County's historic preservation officer, is also with us. The landmark commission was established to ensure the preservation of King County's historic places, material culture and traditions for future, all future generations.It's a nine member commission comprised of volunteers with broad expertize in areas such as architecture, art, land use, historic preservation, archeology, education and history. And staff has not identified any issues with these appointments. But there is an amendment and title amendment for item 12, and I will turn it over to the chair for the interviews of theappointees.Thank you, Mr. Buchholz. I'll be with that. I'm going to move to invite Ms.. Brooks Tucker to introduce herself and speak to her background, which would be interested in bringing to the Landmarks Committee. And I want to acknowledge two from my colleagues from the beginning.They know that Ms.. Brooks Tucker has a time constraint. And so if you are brief, we will understand and I acknowledge you will need to leave shortly after you read your introduction.Thank you, Chair. I so appreciate the flexibility here. So so all of you know why my youngest has returned to school this week and it has been an emotional rollercoaster and so exciting for all of us here. So thank you for the flexibility because I have to run to pick him up from his shortened adjusted day.It's a new schedule for all of us. So a little bit about me. I am from Southern California. I moved up here to Washington with my husband as he was active in the Navy. Let's see, gosh, that was about 12 years ago and we lived on Whidbey Island.My background in education is in architecture and historical preservation. I grew up in a small town of Redlands, Redlands, California. It's a significantly historical town. And I, I really do feel like I got a lot of my values from that upbringing.And it's made me extremely interested in how architectural systems and how they relate to strong historical relevance and how that really shapes an economy. I think that's really made me obsessive, possibly about how we how we shape our communities through environment.And that's that's completely what's brought me here to the Landmarks Commission, among a few other things. Do you have any questions for me?Thank you. I would open with a question if in fact I invite the subsequent appointees to address this, as well as the county works to improve our in continuous improvement around equity and social justice, and particularly around Indigenous peoples being on the traditional lands, the Puget Service peoples.And you speak to how the Land Committee can be mindful of a broad set of landmarks and not to one population.My initial response is is advertisement. I don't feel like there's enough knowledge that we exist. And I think that if that putting us more out there to the public, I think is a great start. I think that so I'm also I'm chair of the Planning Commission of Maple Valley.So it's been a fantastic experience watching you work. And first and foremost, what I have learned from that experience is that we are here to listen to the public. We are their voice and their liaison. And I think that that is also a significant step in bringing about equity.Thank you. Mindful of time. Any colleagues have further questions.Mr. Scheer.Council member.Belushi Not a question, but since we have the applicant here and you've taken your time to speak to us, I just want to say I really appreciate people bringing their passion, their expertize and their their hours and labor to these volunteer positions.It really helps to make so many good things happen in King County to have people like yourself who are willing to volunteer. So thank you very much for your willingness to serve. Thank you.Speaking as the kindergartner who was in a panic, if my grandmother couldn't be seen to pick me up after school from the classroom windows. I want to make sure we look. We let you out in time. Anything else you wish to share with us before stepping out?Not as of right now, but I look forward to coming back to all of you and seeing all of your faces again.Thank you so much for joining us and making today work.Thank you.I'm Mrs. Meisner. I see you've turned your screen and you wanted. Are you just watching? Would you like to make a few introductory comments about the Landmarks Board and the appointees before us today?Yes, thank you. Thank you. Councilor McDermott, I just wanted to chime in to say how thrilled we are to welcome these new members to the King County Landmarks Commission. Each and every one of them brings such a passion for our work for preservation, for equity and vast experience.And I did want to note that that our program is in the middle of an equity and inclusion project in which we are doing additional research into some of our properties that were designated as landmarks many, many years ago.And their nominations did not really tell us an inclusive story. So we are getting ready to basically review those nominations and have they come back before the Landmarks Commission and and basically make sure that the full story of our committee members or community members are told.So we're very excited about that and help to spread the word and and encourage more nominations of properties that represent underrepresented groups. So thank you. Thank you for for taking the time to speak with our appointees today.Thank you, Mr. Chelios. Councilmember Dunn, did you have a question or comment? Just a quick.Comment. Jennifer, good to see you. I hope you're well. I just want to let you know and others know, Dana, in particular. I was just at the Black Diamond Historical Museum there along the old railroad tracks, and they were just a Chris was just yesterday, Dave Forester.They were just incredibly complimentary on the work that your group had done and helping them. They I walked through it and they just keep getting better and better. Lots of fantastic leveraging of local resources and it really is quite a facility that they put together.And they were very, very high praise of you, Jennifer. And folks, your work is wanted to say thank you because it's the kind of place that I'm eager to take my my kids to as soon as it opens back up again.So thank you, Jennifer. Oh.Thank you so much, Councilmember Gunn.And Mr. Chair. Councilmember Tomasky. Well, we're adding thanks. I, too, want to join Councilmember John thank Jennifer for her department's assistance in the city shoreline with helping designate with their landmarks commission the new not the new, but the the old Naval Hospital Chapel, which is tucked in there, a beautiful piece of architectural accomplishment that is now protected. And I know that the expertize and the findings from from our department there really help them. And the community's very excited. So we appreciate the contractual work you do for many of our citizens. And I want to call that out today and thank Jennifer Lamberti.Councilmember, we have two more applicants. Are you very popular?Is very popular. And so I too want to join in and say thank you. The Aurora coffee shop. I'm sorry. The Aroma Coffee shop has brought new life to both city. It is just amazing and beautiful. So thank you for all your work on that and not giving up when there were issues that had to be overcome. And it's definitely worth it. And then I know that there's another bone that is completing the restoration on the Bone Again program. And every time I drive through the valley, these beautiful bones, I think, yay, Jennifer and her team.And then I have a little prayer that I got. I got to get Jennifer out here to see this one. So thank you for all your hard work in that year. Thank you, Mr. Chair.Thank you, Mr. Chelios. The floor is yours. Good morning. Welcome. If you could offer a few words of introduction and speak to your interest in the Landmarks Board. And now you know what coffee shops bought Barnes and other landmarks with benefit mentioned.Mean if you're trying to secure votes to win confirmation.That's right. Well, good morning, council members. Thank you for having me. My name is Dean Priors. I'm currently a principal at Smart Architects where I've been there for 21 years. And our focus is design of affordable housing as well as preservation and adaptive reuse of existing structures.My background, I have an undergraduate degree in archeology and my graduate degree from the University of Washington with a minor and historic preservation. So this is definitely a passion project for me as well. I recently served a six year term on the Pioneer Square Preservation Board, where I served as vice chair and chair, and I was lookingfor kind of a next opportunity to use my skills and interest in applying it to the community. And, you know, I've just been really amazed at the capacity that buildings and places have to be repositories of a community's history and culture and traditions and how they can really serve to activate communities and, you know, just, you know, spark revitalization and interest among. Among the groups of people and to. Chair McDermott's comment about looking at a variety of different landmarks. I think it is true that, you know, historically landmarks have been kind of viewed through a lens of kind of western your Eurocentric perspective, particularly with regard to the architecture itself and kind of looking moreat a high architecture style as well as a that's more Western focused.
