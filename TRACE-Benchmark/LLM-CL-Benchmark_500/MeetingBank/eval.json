Would you like to repeat that?Yeah.It has been moved and seconded comments by members of council. Councilman says Thank.You, Madam President.In addition.Sure. This. The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the effective date of the amended and restated Denver zoning code. We're bringing forth a bundle of amendments and particularly to provide a grace period for certain projects submitted by by July 2nd, 2015, to be processed under the of the current Denver zoning code through January 4th, 2016.It means that there were some projects that were in process that had not been able to get to get get reviewed as soon as they had hoped. So we're delaying it a little time to give them about six months more time for their projects.Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Ortega.Thank you, Madam President. I just want to add that I I'm assuming that we had all received letters from people who have projects in the pipeline that are already going through the process. And there was language in this particular ordinance that just got amended that said everybody would have to go back to starting at the beginning, whichmade no sense. So some of us reached out and asked the planning director to look at this and make sure obviously part of the process is. You know, when somebody's tuned to rezoning, they have to be working with the neighborhoods, as we'll hear tonight on a particular application.But in in the case where somebody's been working on a project and I did some work with a gentleman on Santa Fe who didn't need to rezone his property, who had been going through the process in an example like that would be because of this change.He would have to start the project all over if he hadn't already received his permit. So I appreciate this amendment. Thank you.Thank you. Any other any other comments? Madam Secretary, roll call, please.SUSSMAN Hi. BROOKS Hi. BROWN All right. But I can eat lemon. Lopez. All right.

It's been moved and seconded comments by members of Council. Councilman Sassoon.Thank you, Madam President. The purpose of amending Council Bill 312 is in reference to the updated City Clerk file number in conjunction with the proposed 2015 change changes to amend Chapter 59 Revised Municipal Code and amend and restate the Denver Zoning Code and Council Bill 298, the one we just passed.The only changes to the actual text of the code are to reflect that the amended and restated code takes effect on July six, not June 19th, and that the shallow lot standards shall apply to certain zone lots established prior to July 10th, 2015, not June 25th, 2015.What happened is that the three honey text amendments that we were expecting to come creating their overlay zone district and the National Western Center text a minute amendment creating their zone district are being amended to reflect the revised effective date of the amended and restated zoning code because of our change of date set for Council Bill 298. In our last action, we need to change the dates on these that were that were dependent upon the dates of 298. So the original filed text amendments for Honey and Ash Western reflected that the effective date of the amended and restated zoning code was June 19th and this has now been changed to July six.So now we have to change these.Thank you.

The Committee approved filing this item at its meeting on 8-29-18."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThank you very much. Are there any further comments, those in favor of confirming the appointments vote? I. I those of those opposed vote. No. Motion carries and the appointments are confirmed. These are either part of the Gender Equity Safe Communities and New Americans Committee.The Report of the Gender Equity So Communities and New Americans Committee General 12 Cancel 118904 relating to appropriations for the Seattle Information Technology Department and many audience 125207, which adopted the 2017 budget, lifting a proviso in ratifying confirming certain prior acts.The committee recommends the bill pass.Thanks very much, Councilmember Gonzalez.Thank you. Council Bill 118904 effectively lifts a budget proviso that was documented in Green Sheet 2071b1 2017 concerning some additional need for a community engagement prior to the release of funds for the Seattle Police Department to move forward with its procurement and operation of a department wide program related to body worn video, commonly referred to as bodycameras. Just really quickly, as a refresher around what the conditions of the proviso were that that were imposed upon the department, I just wanted to run through the four components that were documented in that 2017 proviso that were approved by this body.In our last budget cycle, the proviso had four parts to be completed by February 1st of 2017 by the Seattle Police Department. In conjunction with and in consultation with the Community Police Commission, one SPD had to reconvene. The Stakeholder Work Group formed the prior year 2005.And excuse me, 2016 ents and they needed to seek out their advice regarding any outstanding issues or community concerns related to body worn camera protocols and policies to speed in consultation with the stakeholder work group and Council needed to develop a detailed action plan for community engagement on body worn video by December 2nd, 2016, that included aplan for regularly sharing with my committee a status update on community engagement efforts. Three. Speedy needed to submit to the Council a final report that summarized the results of the Department's community outreach that would describe how the draft body worn video policy would was responsive to community input and the operational needs of the department.And the report also needed to identify any unresolved questions or issues related to the body worn video policy and implementation protocols. And lastly, the Department was required to document how it would continue to engage and seek the advice of the stakeholder work group on the use and deployment of body worn video equipment in a sustainable manner wellinto the future of the deployment of this new technology into our community. So before us today is and before my committee last week was a consideration of whether or not the 127 page report submitted by the police department to full council in my committee was effectively in compliance with those four different criteria that were articulated in the2007 2017 proviso. After deliberation, the committee determined that the the the requirements of that proviso were met. I do want to note that we heard in public comment both at committee and here today and have received some email correspondence related to what the what I think could be confusion as to what the proviso was intended to doversus what it wasn't intended to do. And I just want to be really clear that the proviso clearly was a requirement and a directive to the police department to engage in additional community outreach, which I think at the end result had been approximately two years worth of community engagement.I'm not saying that it was an entire two years worth of community engagement. It was certainly in fits and starts, I would say. But the proviso was not intended to relitigate the issue as to whether the city should or should not pursue the body worn video program.And I wanted to be really clear, is the drafter in the generator of that proviso that the intent of the proviso was to make sure that as as the city moves towards deployment of body worn cameras into our community, that it was being done so in a manner that was informed by impacted communities.So that that, I think, is what the actual intent was. And I just wanted to say that given that the the committee recommends that the full council approve the ordinance lifting the body worn video proviso and before I end my comments in hand and answer any questions or open up the floor for others to add their comments, I just wanted to add that in public comment. Again, both in committee and here, we've heard a lot about about whether or not body cameras are desired within our community. And I just wanted to point out to a report that was issued just last year that was commissioned by the Federal Monitor, by the city of Seattle, totake a look at not just community confidence, particularly within communities of color, but also looked at where people were at in terms of their receptiveness to wanting body cameras here. And I'll just read the final conclusion from the report which says, quote, Seattleites overwhelmingly want to see body cameras on their officers.This is almost universally popular, 92% support, 5% oppose like it was in 2015, in which 89% support, 7% oppose. It's again impossible to find a statistically significant population in this city who supports this by any less than 80%.This is similar to the 87% of people who think it's a good idea nationally, according to Pew Research's December 2014 poll. Close quote. So I think the challenge before the department and the challenge before this council is to thread the needle and strike that balance as much as we can between operational needs and legitimate, reasonable policy concernsthat have been expressed by a variety of stakeholders, including the department. And I think that right now what we have before us is, is a policy that has that striving to do that it is currently being considered by the.It will monitor and I believe will have a result or reaction from the federal monitor in early March. So with that being said, I just wanted to lay that out and assure folks who have concerns that this is an iterative process, that we will continue to look at the implementation and deployment of this particular technology in ourcommunity, and that that will be done in a transparent way, primarily by virtue of having quarterly reports in my committee. And I've gotten assurances from the department that to the extent that there are increases in use of force in the field after the point for deployment, that there will be an opportunity to revisit this and consider suspendingthe program.Thank you. Councilmember Gonzalez. Any further comments? Councilmember O'Brien.Thank you. Councilmember Gonzales, I appreciate your work on this in the Dow lining and where we are today. I'm going to be voting against this and I want to just walk through where my concerns stem from. So be clear on that.I think it starts from the general concern that I think folks share is the balance between these cameras. Are they going to be used for surveillance or are they going to be used for police accountability? And there's no doubt that a camera could be used for both.But how we set up a policy that ensures that the predominant preponderance of the work done here is to achieve the police accountability outcomes that I believe we're all working for and to be careful that the surveillance aspects of it, to the extent that they exist, are done in a way that are consistent with our commitment, ongoingcommitment to privacy. I do believe that the the the folks in charge at the police department are trying really hard to get this right. It's a challenging it's a challenging effort to balance this. And yet when I look at where we are today, I feel like there's some work that needs to be done before we proceed toa full deployment citywide. I want to say that I trust our police department, that they're intense and all my work with them, I believe that their intent is outstanding. But that said, I don't believe it's appropriate to pass policies based on my personal trust with the people who happen to be in charge at the moment.I think it's critically important that we have policies that hold up under any set of people that are occupying different positions. And specifically, my concern is around the amount of discretion that officers, I believe, will continue to have.In light of the report that came out. And what that discretion may mean. I believe folks have seen the New York Times article that talked in detail about what's happening here in our city around police body cameras from I believe it's from last October.There's a data piece in there that it's important to repeat. I know folks here have heard it, but when referring to a study by Ariel and Sutherland, it found that police use of force actually went up by an astonishing 71% when officers to turn on their camera, to turn their cameras on or off at will and wentdown by 37% only when they recorded nearly every interaction with public from start to finish. That's one data point, but it's a pretty big data point with a pretty big spread of outcomes depending on how this can be implemented.And so when I look at the I'm specifically looking at attachment F to the report and under Section five, where will Seattle fall following that? Is it a place, a system where they're intended to record every interaction or when they can turn them on and off at will?And it's hard for me to tell, frankly, when I'm looking under Section five, see discretion in recording. It starts off by saying that employee is acting in good faith. To exercise discretion in this policy will not be subject to discipline for the decision to record or not record.That's a pretty big caveat that I think carves out, like, hey, as long as you're trying, we're going to give you a fair amount of leeway. And that feels like it's pretty broad. Then when we look at some of the areas where folks have discretion, there may be a odd circumstance.I'm looking at five F here. There may be limited circumstances when respect for an individual's privacy or dignity outweighs the need to record an event when skipping to the bottom. When an employee believes such a circumstance exists. Employee may deactivate the body worn camera.I won't go into detail to repeating this, but there's numerous places where there's a lot of discretion, and it's hard for me to figure out how we will enforce those rules and say, was it appropriate use of discretion or not?And then we come back to the caveat, well, as long as they're acting in good faith, we're not going to discipline them. It feels like I worry that we are going too far in the direction of the of the study where folks, police officers, will have a significant amount of discretion to turn on and off the camerasat will. So my one issue is with the Seattle Police Department, not, again, their intent. I believe they're trying very hard on a very challenging thing, on a challenging issue. But I'd like to see more work around that.I also have concerns about other levels of government and how that interacts with our ability to implement a law that if it were just up to Seattle, I think we could do much better. Specifically around states, public records, disclosure rules.We've heard that there is an effort, an ongoing effort to change these. But that's an effort that's out of our control. I mean, we will certainly weigh in on that and lobby and have in the past. It's not clear to me that we're significantly closer to resolving that, and there's no certainty that we will resolve it ina way that meets our needs. I appreciate that. In the the police department's response to the ACLU's letter, they highlight that if things don't go the direction we want them to go, that they would certainly be opening to revisit this.But I think that ultimately highlights the uncertainty around it. And finally, setting this, the police department in the state aside, I have serious concerns about federal government's use of data, concerns that frankly, even two weeks ago, I don't know that I would have felt as strongly about we will be collecting immense amounts of data on people inour community. And I don't see any way at the moment how we can shield the federal government from having unfettered access to that one way or the other. And when we have a federal government that is doing things like having immigration agents, board domestic airlines to check IDs of everyone on board, it causes me grave concern aboutwhat this amount of data on people in our city being well, not willingly handed over, being made available because we have no alternative to the federal government does. And again, the urgency of moving forward on accountability is important to me, but weighed against these other factors.My preference would be to not deploy body camera citywide at this time and take a little more time to both see what evolves at the state and federal government and work on our policies internally to see if we can do a better job to eliminate some of that discretion.Thank you. Thank you.Councilmember Bryant. Any further comments? Council members. Back then customer accounts from the question, but yours are just questions. Okay. We'd like to answer it now or later. Okay. Customers want.Thank you, President Harrow. I wanted to thank the. Public Defenders Association, the ACLU, the NAACP and the Council on American-Islamic Relations of Washington State for not only testifying, but also specifically talking to the NAACP and the ACLU for engaging with my office as we sought clarification of many of these questions that were emerging as Councilmember O'BRIEN Youknow, one went over many of them. I think the council members who are advocating for this particular ordinance have cited the support for BODYCAMS and the consent decree and made the case that it's an important part of police accountability reforms.But that is the question that emerges in my mind. Will these cameras be used for police accountability, or will they be used to increase warrantless surveillance of all our communities, particularly our immigrant and black communities who are systematically targeted by law enforcement agencies around the country.I think John Gardner, own of the ACLU, posed that question quite well in his email to council last Wednesday. He said, and I quote, A policy geared towards surveillance and prosecutions looks very different from one geared towards accountability.We should not ignore data that suggests rolling out cameras with the wrong rules may lead to an increase in violence and may decrease community trust in law enforcement at a time when the trust is particularly fragile. It is for this reason that simply rolling out cameras with the stated intent to adjust the policy on the fly isnot a cost free decision. And Gordon and Gordon Brown had a really good quote that was in The New York Times about the some of the information we have. So what policy has the SBT put in place for the deployment of body cams?Well, the fact that discretion for turning the cameras on and off and control over what happens with the footage is fundamentally in control of the speed. Makes it clear to me that this policy cannot, despite intent, be primarily designed to be a tool for accountability.For accountability. There is to be some other independent agency whose mission is accountability of the speed and who are empowered to make those decisions. Otherwise, it's simply a case of the fox guarding the henhouse. Brian Massey, the chief operations officer of the LAPD, was here year, sent this letter.To all council members except for me objecting to the ACLU opposition to their body cam policy. My office will get into the serious failure of communication from a city department or city council member leader. But for today, I would like to focus on the substance of his letter.Brian Maxey admits, quote, The policy does not allow officers discretion to turn the cameras on and off under specific circumstances, but is not nearly as nefarious as the ACLU letter suggests, unquote. I have to ask, how can this be an effective accountability tool if officers have that discretion in the first place?He goes on to concede that, quote, The federal government can request and receive data from the department, unquote, but justifies this by saying that, quote, the speedy currently audio and video records the same sort of events that the current body worn cameras policy instructs officers to capture.The department has almost a petabyte of ICB information, unquote. And by the way, what is a better bite? I don't know. And I think I know a lot about that stuff, but I don't know what a petabyte is.But I would like to quote Sean Garner own again, who said that as to privacy, body cameras record far more video in far more places, including the interior of buildings than in-car videos. So it is disingenuous to suggest that simply because SBT currently audio and video recorders the same sort of events, the body cameras would also havethe same rules apply. Also additionally in the the newest letter from the ACLU talks about a specific concern, I think that should be highlighted. The potential result is that body camera footage, combined with the availability of that footage to the federal government and with facial recognition searches could compromise an individual's immigration status in direct contravention to ourcity's status as a welcoming city. For example, day laborers often gather in the parking lot of Home Depot in West Seattle, which is located next to the Speedy West Precinct, with officers wearing body cameras. Recordings showing the faces of those individuals would be open for the federal government to run facial recognition searches, possibly triggering deportation actions.I don't think these these concerns should be taken lightly, especially at a time when Trump is a Donald Trump has made it very clear his administration is going to systematically go after a whole host of immigrants, not just as he claims, you know, criminal immigrants with criminal records.I think this is of a great concern. And I think that given all of the concerns that have been raised by the various organizations, I will have to vote no on this legislation.Thank you. Council members want. Any further comments from any of my cast cast members?QUESTION And Councilmember Gonzales, maybe you can address this because I was with you in the committee last week after the committee, Reverend Walden, someone who we all know and has been very engaged in the CPC, said to me that she felt that we had not addressed how we were going to protect people in domestic violence situations, thattheir faces, if the cameras are on, could be a problem. I wonder if that's something that you can address if right now if we could ask for clarification at another time. So I appreciate hearing a little bit because I really want to make sure that people are protected in those situations and that they can call and feelthat they will their privacy will be protected and retained throughout.If if.Go ahead.If it's okay with Councilmember Banks, I'll answer that question in my comments if that's acceptable. Thank you.Councilmembers speak now.Yes, thank you. So body worn video is another step toward greater transparency of policing in Seattle. And as Councilmember Gonzales has accurately relayed, our action today lifts a proviso that allows these cameras to be distributed to more officers.Beyond the initial pilot, which was conducted last year in the East Precinct and then the equipping of our downtown bicycle officers at the beginning of this year. But a video and audio recording is not new to the police department.It goes back 12 years. In December of 2005, the police department first began using in-car videos, often referred to as dash cam videos. And they were deployed then in 2006. And today, all uniformed, deficient divisions of Speedy are equipped with the in-car video systems for recording, video and audio.The patrol officers. Traffic officers. Gang Unit. SWAT team. The only uniform. Unit that does not have the in-car video systems or motorcycle traffic officers. The in-car video system or dashcam videos are required to be turned on by officers any time an officer takes law enforcement action, including street stops like Terry stops on the street.Any time they arrive at a location of a dispatched call. And once they turn them on, the in-car video cannot be turned off according to a state statute. If an officer has not manually turned on the in-car video system, it automatically comes on when the officer activates their emergency lights or their siren.In addition to in-car video systems, our detectives commonly record interviews with witnesses and crime suspects. Now I want to address this issue of discretion. And it's interesting when we read selectively from the policy that that guides the use of body worn videos, it's it's actually quite explicit.Section five B lists when employees are expected to use the body worn videos. Dispatched calls are very similar to the in-car video system. Traffic in Terry stops, same as in car video. On view infractions and criminal activity. Same as in car video.Arrests and seizures. Same as in car video searches and inventories of vehicles, persons or premises. Sometimes that's the same as in-car video. Sometimes it's not. Transportation of individuals in their cars. Vehicle pursuits or chasing of criminal suspects. And questioning of victims, suspects and witnesses unless the individual does not want to be recorded.But even if an individual tells an officer, I don't want you to use your body worn video to record me, the officer cannot turn off their in-car video, so the audio from that is still going to be recorded.And if they're within visual range of the in-car video system, that will be video recorded as well. Officers do have some limited discretion. They can turn off their body worn videos in bathrooms inside of jails. Interiors of medical, mental health counseling or therapeutic facilities.Unless they're engaged in a direct law enforcement purpose, such as viewing a crime in progress, they're also required to ask consent before they record inside of a private residence. If a person denies consent, they still have to notify that person that the audio is still going to be recorded because of the in-car video system that will berunning. Even though the video may not be available. They're also allowed to protect the privacy and dignity of individuals. And it lists in the section that Councilmember O'Brien read it. It explains where officers may be able to make that kind of a discretionary call.At natural death scenes. When they're giving a death notification. Child assault victims or sexual assault victims? Cultural or religious objections to being recorded. And where use of the body worn video would impede or limit the cooperation of victims or witnesses.It's been suggested that. We shouldn't approve this continued expansion of. Body worn videos because it is not limited just to police officer accountability that it could be used for collection of evidence. This is an issue that the Washington legislature considered last year in 2016 and soundly rejected any notion that these videos could only be used for officerdiscretion and could not be used as evidence of criminal activity. If we were to pursue a policy that would say we could only use these videos for officer accountability, we would be saying to our police officers, we can use this body worn evidence against you if you engage in misconduct, but we cannot use it against the individualwho may assault you. And that's just a crazy idea. So I think we should continue with the. Distribution of the body worn videos. It is sound policing policy. It is supported by the American Civil Liberties Union nationally. It is supported by police reform advocates across our country.And it's used in literally hundreds and hundreds of police departments around the United States, including 40 or 50 right here in Washington State.Thank you, Councilman Burgess. Excuse me. Any further comments from any of my colleagues? Well, I guess I'll just say a few. And that is the very simple issue in front of us, is whether the terms of the proviso have been listed.As Councilmember Gonzalez pointed out, number one, have convened a stakeholder group of the number two developed a title Action Plan for Community Engagement. Have they issued a final report summarizing that work? And it was indeed a lengthy report.And have they documented how they will continue to engage and seek the advice of a stakeholder workgroups? And I think under undisputedly my mind, they have complied with the letter of that proviso, and I'm certainly supporting the lifting of the proviso for those reasons.It's always sort of a natural. I suppose. Inclination to get caught up in the pros and the cons of body cameras to begin with. And I respect the opinions that we heard from some of those opposing today and certainly not new objections and very respectful objections.But in 2017, I think we are living in a country and in a city where video technology has changed the landscape of this country. That had it not been for video recordings throughout this country, we would not be having probably probably the intense both demonstrations and intense focus on what is happening to particularly African-Americans.But many people who have unfortunately suffered at the. At the hands of police officers. In 2016, over 250 African-Americans were killed by police officers. Not not all unjustified, but these are staggering numbers when you look at what's happening without body cameras.Look at our criminal justice system. We have a lot of data that would support. And I have all of the citations that. African-Americans are clearly arrested, as we know, at six times the rate of white people in our country, that a black person is 3.7 times likely to be arrested for marijuana possession, when in fact the usagein these groups between blacks and whites are the same. African-American drivers are about 31% more likely to be pulled over than a white driver. Black drivers are three times more likely than white drivers to be searched during a traffic stop.That is our criminal justice system in this country. And while I'm not suggesting that. Body cameras will do away with this institutionalized. Injustice. What I am suggesting is that there's already a record of what's happening out there in the field.The record is what an officer records on his or her report. What I am personally looking for, and I've been looking for since 2010, when I discovered the advent of body of camera technology, is objective evidence and a record, if you will, of what's happening.And this concern that the ACLU expressed that violence would go would could possibly go up. Is completely inconsistent with the statistics where body cameras are put in place. We have over 50 cities in the state where body cameras are already in place.We have over a thousand police departments in this country where body cameras are in place. A study in Rialto, California, which is a very statistically valid study that was done and very in-depth study, clearly showed that the use of force.Against people dealing with the police had gone down 60%. People tend to act differently and often times more responsibly when they know they are being recorded. And this argument that the cameras must be on at all times, and we are concerned that officers have discretion to turn them off, and therefore the answer is to keep them off. That to me is entirely inconsistent. That. The office. We already know that officers have incredible discretion in what they're already doing. And again, we have countless examples in this country that justice would not seen even closely the light of day had it not been for body cameras.And so while certainly it is not the end all to be all in terms of the issues dealing with us, I think it provides one more tool, again, to let us evaluate what's happening in the field such that we can learn.And together the police department is a learning organization and the city is a learning organization can learn from the deployment of this technology. And as I said earlier, we're sort of getting behind this. Technology is evolving. These policies will change.And again, to me, we have to begin the deployment such that we can learn and improve and modify the policies. Last. I'd also say that. Council bill rather House Bill 2362 there was an Olympia very recently, you know, which deals with of course, to the costs associated with archiving and the costs associated with public disclosure request hadseveral other aspects. On the use of body cams as well. And there was a lot of talk in Olympia about that process. And I'll just read one letter that was written by Reverend Walden and cosigned by many organizations, including the representatives from the Philip Randolph Institute Seattle chapter from Partner for Youth Achievement, Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Churchand others Mothers for Police Accountability. But they clearly said in this letter that. That people of color were involved in the process of drafting House Bill 2362 and that the city of Seattle had already convened a process. I got to tell you, I attended on March.On March on January 19th, I believe it was the African-American Police Advisory Council, January 19th, where this matter was discussed. I've had debates at the University of Washington. I've had legislative districts where they've endorsed use of body cams.As Councilmember Gonzales said, there were several polls or or surveys taken where this is overwhelmingly supported by the public. So I think it's time to actually deploy it. The technology continues to grow the community on modifying the policies as we see.But again, this sort of endless process of that, we seem to get stalled. I think it's time to move on. Okay. Well, let's wrap up. I think we're trying to vote. Please call the role on the passage of the Bill O'Brien.I know it's. You got a record. I know. Thank you.So aren't they. Hi, Burgess. Hi, Gonzalez. Johnson. Whereas I. President Herrell I. Five in favor, two opposed.Thank you. The bill passed and Cheryl signed it. Please read the next agenda item.\nSummary:", "answer": "AN ORDINANCE related to appropriations for the Seattle Information Technology Department; amending Ordinance 125207, which adopted the 2017 budget; lifting a proviso; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nSo moving right along. Every financial report, every audited financial statement contains three main sections. Next one to the introductory section, which is just a summary of our organization in the context of the results. The financial section, which first of all contains the independent auditors report, which is their opinion, and we always want to see that they giveus a clean opinion, that our statements are fairly presented. And the second part of that is the management discussion and analysis, which is a context for all of the results and then the statements. And they are presented in a variety of formats.And if you've looked at the reports recently, we follow all of the required generally accepted reporting requirements. So it doesn't look like just in the quarterly financial reports that we give you, but it's done in a variety of fashions.Excuse me, government wide is summarizing those funds which operate to provide services and business type, which are the enterprise funds of which we have only one now with their net position, which is assets and sources as well as liabilities and uses the major funds which are the individual funds, including their budget, the actual position with fund balances. So there's a variety of ways that we look at all of our. Financial resources. The next part of it is the notes. Notes to the statement which detail the historic information and provide a narrative description of specific items, including assets and long term liabilities, pensions and OPEB, other post-employment benefit liabilities.So if you really want to know more about those issues, you can read the notes and you'll get a lot of detail. Other funds include the non-major. They're smaller in size. They don't have as much operating impact. Internal service funds, which do have impact in that they operate with the operating funds and fiduciary funds, which are thingsthat we do in trust for other people or other organizations. The final section is the statistical section, which which presents financial trends, revenue capacity, debt capacity. I put debit debt, debt capacity, demographic and economic information and other operating data.It is important to note that this is not audited information in the statistical section. It's what staff, supplies and provides. And we rely on other resources and other agencies to give us information as well. So finally, what are our results for this past fiscal year 2013 and 14?So all funds grew as revenues increased and expenditures were contained. So it's true overall for all of the funds. Some of the financial highlights, our net position is $402 million, $23 million of which or 5.7% is unrestricted and available for use for future uses.Governmental Funds Combined Fund balance of $95,000,000.20 $9 million 30% is available for other uses, the reserve policy has is 20%. It actually came out to be 40% at the year end. Subsequently, five additional percent has been at three and a half million dollars was added to the reserve as an exigency reserve.And in addition, we added another $3 million for deficiencies and other long term obligations. So we've reduced that 40%. Debt increased by only $289,000. This increase due to the fluctuation in debt service schedules. They're not all even in the state, just the same all the time.One of the final pieces that the auditors perform is called the Memorandum of Internal Controls and Required Communications, and this report is required under generally accepted auditing standards. And they reported two significant deficiencies. The first first deficiency was is being worked on.And that has to do with continuing disclosure. We did not fully meet the requirements by not timely filing all of our reports. We have contracted with a company DAC Bond to maintain and maintain timely quality filings. One one deficiency was resolved and that had to do with the administrative access controls to our accounting system.And we with the movement to the cloud system are able to more finely tuned those controls and maintain better internal controls. New pronouncements by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board will require that we present the pension and OPEB data in new formats, and we are working with consultants already in order to begin formatting that so that the auditorswill have that information in the format that they need. Finally, we have compliance reports. You see in the exhibits attached to the report that there are a lot of smaller reports. These are compliance reports required by either granting agencies or other parts of the state government.We all of the data comes directly from the Kafir and is presented in the compliance reports and perhaps in a little bit different format as required by the granting agency. And that's why we have these separate compliance reports.All of these reports, the audit, the memorandum of Internal Controls and Required Communications and all the compliance reports are posted on our website and are available for everyone to read and query. I'd like to introduce Ms.. Grace Zang from Mason Associates, who has kindly come and kept kept me company this evening and is available to answer anyreally technical questions that you might have about the audit report.Ashton's.Well, I'm going to ask, is Adam here? I'm going to ask a general catchall question. Is there anything that, however you so define it that's substantially different in the way in which the report was prepared as substantially different from the way in which reports were prepared in the past?And you need to speak in the microphone up here.Prepared this year with last year.Year before. Yeah we have been the auditors for multiple years and I am not the in chief partner.On a job. I'm just representing Catherine.Now, based on my knowledge, there is no, um, we have been consistent in our reporting approach. And in other.Words, except for whatever the state says that you have to report now, the methodology, data sources, the way in which the data is treated for the most part is the same as before.Yes. Okay.That's my catch up basket.Okay. And I'd like to share that. As far as I know, this presentation was not online. I don't think it was part of this packet.No, the presentation is just a summary of what was in the staff report. So no, the present the the powerpoint was not online.Okay. So if the PowerPoint could be added to this and some PowerPoints were included, so then we can see them in advance. And that is my preference, if at all possible. And actually it to me it's an aid and I'm sure it is to our community of it's possible to include the PowerPoints in advance.And there was a comment and yes.Also the there's information in PowerPoint. I think the staff report it. The CAF are the one that jumped off the page to me is the 40% versus 20%. Or if it's not in the staff. Oh, that's the first time I saw.I think that came about as I was preparing this and Miss Warmer Day and I were looking at the analysis of what what the results were and we said, oh, look at this. This is an interesting fact that we didn't know when we would just have a report.If you can come back and tell us what that really means. Why? Why is there that disparity?The disparity?I mean, why why is it so much more.Why it grew was because the revenues increased and the expenses didn't. And it it was already at 30 or 35% in prior years. And so what we gained in this particular fiscal year then added it and brought it up to the 40%.If I may if I may, in a nutshell, we predicted revenue growth of under 3%. We got 3.6% in one year that went into the reserves, the extra. Then last year we closed at 8.1%, having projected about 2.9.That all went in reserve as well. And at the same time the labor contracts began to bite into the employees paychecks by taking more out for health care, taking more out for pensions, all of that. So there was there were cuts and costs happening the same time as unexpected growth in revenue.And hence, you ended up with a, you know, double the policy in terms of where we are, which is, you know, not a bad problem to have, but it shouldn't be confused with the solution to the long term problems that still loom over the city financially.That's why the word unrestricted. Is I mean, it may be true, but it's not. Right. Well.A a part of that is unrestricted, but a part of it is restricted by the actions that the previous council took to restrict those that. A $3 million.I mean, it's unrestricted and restricted or technical terms for the for the auditors and the accountants. It doesn't mean that anybody should look at it and say this money to general fund is not the only fund. There's a lot of other funds that we manage.One of the things that is changing, however, over the past several years is that pension and other post-employment benefit obligations now must be characterized, according to Gatsby. In the past, you didn't even have to put those on your balance sheet.Now you do. I think that kind of application is really important for all the people who may be watching of us to understand the budget that's coming at us a year in calendar year to see what our position.I appreciate that, that explanation. Late hours.And I hope that you will be repeating it that, you know, at another meeting, because I can.Tell you I have my notes right here.Lisa, thank you.Well, there will be a systematic approach to the Council regarding the budget beginning in March and working our way through March, April, May, June to get to a two year budget resolution in early June. So as that happens, these issues will be decanted in significantly greater detail.I like that.Gather member data just quickly.Something like a $29 million budget that amounts to 40% of a 40% reserve, I mean, is absolutely great news with Capital G. I think the key thing for purpose of the public is to understand what's the the key components that's driving it.For example, my understanding is from what former Mayor Mary Gilmore told me, is that a key a key component of that tonight, what contributed to the $29 million reserves is a one time sale of property transactions that generated some level of of of extra taxes that we had not initially calculated, though, that that went to the good. So so I think that's what we're getting at is whenever there are these big things that we all want, there are great. But also one other big things that are not so great understand. What are the key driving elements.Yeah. Thank you.And, and we've already discussed those issues for the budget we have.Yeah. And it turns out that in the last revenue report when we announced the 8.1%, we broke it down into these are one timers and these are ongoing and thank you for bringing that up because the the one time events can't be counted on for up.And I think that's one of one of my council referrals. Principal I'd like us to discuss. Actually get to that for.Any other member comments. I'll move. Accepted. And I'd like to make a comment. Oh. So I was at a conference for mayors and new members. Member authority was also there and a slide was presented in regards to Alameda County City's unfunded OPEB liabilities as a percentage of their general fund as of June 30th, 2013.And and I want to share this as part of this discussion that showed Alameda, those cities ranged from 7% to 140%. And the city of Alameda was the 140%. And I think it's very important that we share that as part of this conversation, because we were talking about.I mean, someone paying attention right now on TV could think we're doing actually very well. And then we have this other issue that is very contrary to that that we will be discussing as we're moving forward. I wanted to add that in your motion now.Yeah. I would move recommendation to accept the fiscal year 20 1314 audited financial statements and compliance reports. All those in favor I oppose. Motion unanimously carries. Thank you. Now the next item meeting. So we will now adjourn that so we can hop to the.Yes. I'm sorry.Madam Chair. Just a point of clarification on the item.At three A.Is the joint meeting. And we cannot continue that meeting until tomorrow night's meeting because it wasn't noticed as a joint meeting. So that one will have to be deferred until the next meeting of the joint body.And is staff that you're okay with that they'll still care. All right. Thank you. So's council. Most of you are okay with that. So then we're going to have that item come back. That was three. We'll come back.We're going to adjourn that meeting and re adjourn go back to that now reopen our general meeting. And the next item was 66. K is the one that you'd like us to address. Six K is.Recommendation to authorize the city manager to execute a professional services agreement between the city and AFRINIC, Brian Day and Company for two year.For two years with three one year extensions for a total.Amount not to exceed $750,400 for independent audit services.Any questions? Yes, I would just make a comment that not only and I think the point was well stated in the report that it's not that the current auditing firm has done anything wrong, but they've been our independent auditors for 24 consecutive years.And sometimes it's just good to get some fresh thinking and new blood in. And if we do approve this contract, we will actually be saving $32,725 over a five year period compared to the previous fees charged by the previous firm.\nSummary:", "answer": "Recommendation to Accept the Fiscal Year 2013-14 Audited Financial Statements and Compliance Reports.

Councilors Braden and Edwards offered the following a lot of for a hearing to review rental unit conditions, standards and inspections in the city of Boston.Thank you. The Chair recognizes the district councilor from Brighton, Councilor Liz Braden. You have the floor.Thank you, Mr. Chair. I move to suspend Rule 12 and add Councilor Baucus, a third original co-sponsor of Docket zero 1 to 4, please.Councilor Brayton seeks suspension of Rule 12 and the adoption of Councilor Baucus original co-sponsor. Seeing no objection, Councilor Brock is hereby added. Please proceed, Councilor Braden.Thank you and thank you to my colleagues, Councilor Edwards and Bach, for their partnership on this issue. This hearing order is to invite the Inspection Services Department to review and the enforcement to a municipal code covering inspection and re-inspection of rental units and rental dwelling unit standards.We have just concluded the annual rituals around in September, the rental lease renewal turnover cycle and colloquially called Alston Christmas. And I've heard from a significant number of Alston Brighton tenants about rental unit conditions and questionable compliance with city regulations.We must review the city's current property registration and inspection practices, and my concern is not so much with the inspection and registration of exempted property owner occupied units, but particularly with larger corporate and absentee landlords who have become chronic offenders, allowing violations to pile up and having the means to pay off a fine after a fine withoutactually improving living conditions in their units. Under current rental unit registration practices, larger multi property owners have not are not required to disclose information of all individuals and entities with business ownership interests. The public does not have any meaningful way or convenient access to rental unit registration registry information, making it difficult to hold chronic offenders accountable.This conversation will be an opportunity to check in with ESD on the tools and resources that they need to implement better solutions to effectively rein in bad actors and to take advantage of the current. And they take advantage of the current system in order to improve living conditions.And we really need to use the system to improve living conditions for renters across our city.

This has been one of the most consistent conversations I've had since I've joined this body, and that is where working with Estee to figure out that the laws that we have on the books are actually getting enforced.And I remember and many of the budget hearings, we often ask, Do you have the Resources Council? Flynn asked, Do you have the Resources Council clarity? Do you have the resources to enforce the new laws? And I think this is just a check in about that, especially as we're in the middle of a transition and we're dealingwith more and increased rental units. But we also are wondering if they're really complying with the law. I think we recently just had a wonderful conversation or introduced a hearing order for making sure that property owners are being held accountable.We want to make sure that their rental renters are actually being seen and being tenants that we even know where they exist. I think at the end of the day, one of the best things we can do is have a robust list of all the rental units, know the conditions of them in the city of Boston, sothat when we go to push new policy, we're able to add one email or one mass mailing, genuinely get to all the tenants and landlords at one time. And having worked at the Office of Housing Stability, oftentimes that was the way in which we used this list.It wasn't just assess fines. It was honestly to communicate. There is a pandemic. There's a new law about how you need to file your notice to quit. All of these different things are more efficient if we have a role.Best list that is up to date. And honestly, I think the ability for ESD or any of the city department to check in and get to all of the all of the excuse me, the apartments in the city is also been a growing not so much concern, but something we still continue to work on.We're still trying to actually get through the first level, I think, of inspecting all of the units in the city of Boston. So we're excited to just not criticize, not throw under the bus, but really figure out honestly, how are we going to do this together as a team?Thank you.Thank you very much. The chair now recognizes the third original co-sponsor, the district council from Beacon Hill. Councilor Bach, the floor is yours.Thank you so much, Councilor O'Malley. And I'm really proud and pleased to be joining Councilor Brayton and Edwards on this. I think thinking about last week's filing, in this week's filing and sort of taking that two track effort, because on the one hand, I think we would get more problematic property owners attention if we enacted what wetalked about last week, which is an increase in municipal fines. But in the meantime, we've got you know, we want to pursue that, but we also want to use the tools that we have to hand now. And I think that, you know, I came from a Problem Properties Taskforce meeting this morning in Mission Hill.And I just think that again and again we run into the issue of, okay, in theory, there's this thing on the books, but has I followed up? Where are we? And I think a lot of the housing inspection materials specifically are still kept on paper in a way that can make it really hard to to have thatbird's eye view that helps us get at the bad actors. And and I think we just have to all recognize that it's you know, there's been a lot of conversation about how tenants get squeezed by rent rates. And that's very true and real and real pressure.But also, like tenants get squeezed when, you know, there's lots of hidden fees. They're having to spend a ton of their time to harass their landlord to get a basic thing that's supposed to come as part of their apartment.You know, they're living with the stress, like, you know, the bad health conditions of a substandard unit. So there's a lot of ways that the power imbalance of a landlord tenant relationship can affect the lives of the majority of Bostonians who do rent besides besides just rent.And I think that it gives our our responsible, good landlords in the city. You know, it frustrates them to no end. I know as well, I'm on the property task force call with a number of them in Mission Hill.And I think that, you know, everybody in the community loses when we've got landlords who feel like they can just ignore these complaints and these real, real quality of life issues for Bostonians and and not have it go anywhere.So really looking forward to this hearing and hoping that we can figure out how together we use our existing regulations to escalate things more effectively and solve more of these problems. So just again, want to thank Councilors Edwards and Creighton for their partnership on this.Thank you, Councilor Buck. The chair now recognizes the district council from South Boston. Councilor Flynn, the floor is yours.Thank you, Mr. President. And please add my name. I just want to say thank you to the Makers for sponsoring this important hearing. I think Councilor Edwards said it best, as we also need to make sure we have the inspectors that will actually go out and do the work and inspect the properties, including Airbnbs.These are a lot of quality of life issues, but I think it's upon us as a city council during the budget process. We just can't we shouldn't accept any more from department heads that they have the necessary funding in their budget.We have to push back a little bit on that. No city department wants to come down here and say they have all the necessary funds to do their job because that's not accurate. We need to be more aggressive as a body, myself included, in pushing back in and saying, No, you don't have enough money to do inspectionsand that you need more money and to do this job right, we have to make sure the money is in the budget so these inspectors, as inspection inspectors, can go around and do their job, whether it's checking on tenants or doing Airbnb related issues.But at the budget process, process it's critical that we fund. These programs and services. Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Counselor Flynn. Would any Madam Clerk, please I. Counselor Ed Flynn as a co-sponsor. Any further discussion on docket 1024? Would any councilors wish to add their name? Madam Kirklees at Councilor Arroyo. Councilor Baker. Councilor Campbell. Councilor Side B George.Councilor Flaherty. Councilor me here. Please add the Chair's name to Councilor Wolf and docket 1024 will be referred to the Committee on Housing and Community Development. I'd now like to invite Councilor Campbell to please take over the dais.And as she comes up, Madam Clerk, would you please read docket 1025.1025?\nSummary:", "answer": "Order for a hearing to review Rental Unit Conditions, Standards, and Inspections in the City of Boston.\nOn motion of Councilors Breadon and Edwards , Rule 12 was invoked to include Councilor Bok as a co-sponsor."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nFour eyes, eight knees. Council Bill 626, as amended, has failed. Councilman Espinosa, please put Council Bill 760 on the floor.Thank you, Mr. President. I move that council bill 76 to be placed upon final consideration and do pass.It's. I see. I need a second. Great. Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. It has moved and moved in second at the public here of Council Bill 760 is open. May we have the staff report process?Good evening, council members. Thanks for hanging in there. Thanks, everyone, for hanging in there. And congratulations on just 1/2.Hey, as you're exiting, could you please could you please lower your voice just so we can get going on this council? Bill. Thank you.So again, congratulations. And I am a barge with the Department of Community Planning and Development here to bring the 38th and Blake Station area height amendments to you for final consideration. These are amendments to five plans that overlap in the 38th and Blake Station area.It's a bit unusual to specifically amend plans in this way. There there is a reason we know, of course, and just previously discussed the level of change going on throughout the city of Denver. But this area, of course, is just right at the vanguard of that change.It's changing so rapidly and there's so much development opportunity. And and there also is a lot of public investment that has already gone into this area and that will go into this area. And that presents an opportunity more technically.These five overlapping plans have obscured the vision, I would say, for heights in this, the most critical area right around the station. And and we seek to improve and clarify that. And then throughout the process of looking at the height amendments, some things came up that we'll also discuss in terms of the need for new tools topromote higher design quality in the area. And you're you haven't escaped yet. Affordable housing is also part of this discussion. So I mentioned the public improvements here. You're all aware of the Brighton Boulevard streetscape improvements that are are just starting really significant improvements there.The Planned River, North Park, the new commuter rail station at 38th. And Blake, together, they represent essentially hundreds of millions of dollars worth of public improvements in the area where this plant amendment will occur. And I think that that relates to a concept that I want to discuss a little bit regarding value capture.And that is the idea that with all of this investment, that the community that the public is putting into this area, along with the idea that actually it might be more appropriate for there to be even more intense level of private development near the station than was anticipated in the previous plans.But that provides an opportunity to capture some of the value that all of this creates for the community, specifically in the form of higher quality design and the integration of affordable housing into the station area. And that's what we heard really specifically from the community throughout this process, that high density tower development.Yes, it's appropriate. It's it has to provide benefits. This sets a little bit of a of a new precedent, this idea for specifically capturing value in an area like this. But I think it's something and I and I know Brad Buchannan, the director of Community Planning and development, feels this way, too, that this is an important precedentto set and this is an important or a very appropriate place to do it. The 38th and Blake area to look at how all of this investment, all of this development potential can really specifically produce benefits for the community beyond just the development itself.So and then just looking at that, the technical reasons for amending the plan, those five overlapping plans start with the 2003 River North Area Plan. There was a stationary plan in 2009, the Northeast Downtown Neighborhoods Plan in 2011, and then the 2014 Globeville plan and most recently the 2015 Elyria and Swansea.A neighborhood plan all make recommendations that overlap at least some part of the area that we're talking about tonight. A lot of them agree, or at least are clear, that the newer plan sets precedent over the older plan.But you have to look at all of these different plans to figure out what's going on. And it tells a story that's that's a little hard to read. Also the most recent plan earlier in Swansea, a neighborhood plan, you know, in some cases it says things like taller building heights may be appropriate in certain locations or thatprovide community benefits but doesn't say what those locations are or what the benefits are. We're we're fixing that with these plan amendments. So before I I'll run through the the four major recommendations of the plan. The process began early this year.Tim Watkins, with Community Planning and Development, was the project manager throughout most of the process. As many of you know by now, he's moved on to a job in Utah, which is where he's lived for years. So that's the whole it was a long time coming.And so Tim is no longer with the department, but he he really ran a very inclusive public process for this amendment effort that included four major public workshops. Thanks to the folks at XDA for hosting those we had, you know, I think more than a couple hundred people at that, at least one of them.So they were very well attended. This hearing tonight, the final adoption hearing concludes the the adoption process. But we actually are ready to move into implementation right away. Essentially, this is these are very targeted amendments. And we're looking at doing the implementation for the higher building design quality that I'll talk more about and the integration of affordablehousing, essentially starting tomorrow, if you give us the green light. So the the recommendation of the plan amendments, the first and kind of most overarching recommendation is to promote taller building heights that some that support transit oriented development or TOD in the station area.And that means what we heard as part of the the community process develop these amendments that taller heights are appropriate particularly near the station platform than were recommended in the previously adopted plan. So just to be clear, the this these amendments do recommend taller heights.But those taller heights would have to come with transitions to surrounding neighborhoods. Cole and Curtis Park have the most exposure, but also Globeville and Elyria. Swansea, and that those taller heights have to come along with the provision of community benefits.So this is an important map in the plan amendments. It's on page seven of the of the plan amendments in your packets. It's a little bit more complex than the typical heat map in a plan because it's showing two different things.The colors, the red, for instance, that's around the station area marked by a T there shows the maximum incentive height, showing that as 16 stories near the station platform. But we're also showing those those white numbers and the white lines are showing what the maximum base heights are.And what that is, is are the heights that are recommended by all those overlapping, existing adopted plans. Typically, when we had a new plan, we'd be setting those aside and moving on. In this case, there's there's a couple of specific reasons to keep those heights on the book and on the books.We're calling them Base Heights. Number one is just to clarify where we're starting from when we say that the development that takes advantage of the heights that are enabled by this plan amendments provides community benefits. So it's the development clearly that's above those heights that are in white.Number two is more technically that we're we're able to clarify the status of map amendments that will be coming through the system. So at least two MAP amendments in this area will come to you before we're able to create the tools that would require the higher design quality and the integrated affordable housing.But what we're saying is that. Map amendments that seek only the heights that were recommended in the previous plans that don't seek to take advantage of these new, taller heights can be appropriate in the interim. But the plan amendments are very direct in saying that map amendments that seek the taller building heights, for example, 16 storeys atthe platform would not be appropriate until the tools have actually been developed to compel the community benefits to to require integrated, affordable housing and higher design quality. So that first recommendation to promote Taller Building Heights comes along with the need to promote height transitions.Here we're looking from a point in the whole neighborhood. If you look at this viewpoint right now, you wouldn't see much down there at the end of the street if that area around the platform were built out. According to the currently adopted plans, it might look something like this off in the distance.The plan amendments would allow for taller building heights over there. So you might see something like this, but those taller building heights would come along with the specific community benefits. Recommendation number two really just gets more specific about the need to adopt a regulatory approach to ensure greater design quality throughout the station area.Talks about what greater design quality means a little bit more specifically or what it would seek to achieve in terms of active and walkable public realm, minimizing parking visibility and how and how we intend to more specifically accomplish that or regulate the higher design quality.So just visually looking at what higher design quality might mean, it might mean that there's mass reduction in buildings, that these bigger buildings have to be broken down into smaller parts or can't just be big boxes, that there's greater activation at the pedestrian level, like taller ground floor heights or more specific requirements about ground floor uses.These images on the upper right, you'll see screened parking is one of the things that is in the category of higher design quality specific requirements about the design of any structured parking that's visible from the street. And then I mentioned mass reduction kind of on the left center slide there, meaning that, yes, the plan amendments are sayingthat taller buildings are appropriate, but that doesn't just mean a 16 storey box say that there's going to be a tool applied to compel something to be happening with that box, whether it's upper story setbacks or or other mechanisms that break down the mass and scale of the building.Recommendation number three is to establish the river corridor as an amenity and a resource. This was something that most people that we talked to in the planning process really felt strongly about, that we needed to be very clear on how the river should be treated.And what that means specifically is that it should be treated as if it were a primary street in terms of what level of transparency would be required, and that all of these tools that will require higher design quality should should be applied to the frontages facing the river as well.The final recommendation regards the integration of affordable housing into the station area. And talks about the increased heights as an incentive for affordable housing built within walking distance of the station. And that this needs to be coordinated with citywide, affordable housing programs.We now have a new citywide affordable housing program. As of moments ago, the intent is that we develop a tool subsequent to the adoption of these plan amendments that works with the new citywide regulations to promote affordable housing that's actually provided specifically within this area.And will will go through a separate process to actually develop those tools. So there's still some unknowns with it. But the basic objectives are it it promotes housing that's there by the station and that it works with this system that you just adopted.So we're not using different metrics. We're requiring the same kind of housing. The final part of the plan, amendments on beginning on the last page, just get a little bit more specific about the next steps. The really important one being this are regulatory and policy strategies saying that, yes, you know, we are directed with adoption of theseplan amendments to move forward with tools such as a design overlay district to implement regulations or recommendations for greater design quality and for integration of affordable and mixed income housing near the station area. And I'll just mention, and I think a couple of members of our steering committee may speak about this when I'm finished as well.But the River North R.A. has been working for some time on a request for a design overlay district for River North that really addresses many of the ideas that came out as part of the 30th and Blake Station area process.And what we're looking at doing is taking that design overlay request and using that as the foundation for for what greater design quality means at 30th and Blake and then throughout the rest of of river north as well.The moving forward recommendations also just emphasize that some of the more general recommendations in those previous plans really need to be emphasized specifically in terms of public investment strategies and the need to continue partnerships. Those are more broad recommendations that we continue to work on those things as opposed to the really that specific first recommendation that wemove forward right away with the implementation of the regulatory tools. And just to know the way that will accomplish or that we plan to accomplish the plan amendments is to have them as a standalone document, as you saw in your package.But then to on the covers of all of the affected plans to note that that part of the plan has been amendment amended and that you should review the other the newly adopted document. So I'll just go there's a lot more detail about this in your staff report, so I won't spend much time here, but just runningthrough the criteria for adoption of a plan or plan amendments in this case, the first being plan consistency and staff finds that the proposed plan amendments are consistent with the Denver Comprehensive Plan and the relevant plan amendments that are listed on this slide, which include the five plans that will be updated.That an inclusive public process was used to create the plan amendments. As I mentioned previously, there were four big public workshops as part of the process. This was all assisted by a great steering committee, which included representatives of all of the affected RINO's.They met very regularly throughout the process. Tim Watkins actually went to a lot of neighborhood meetings and gave presentations and answered questions throughout the process. And we had the usual electronic outreach, including a website. The final criteria is that the plan or plan amendments take a long term view, and we find that the 30th and Blake stationaryamendments establish a vision framework that will guide change in the neighborhood for the next 20 years and that that's an appropriate long term perspective. So our staff recommendation, based on the findings of the plan amendment, is consistent with the Denver comprehensive plan and applicable supplements.Then an inclusive public process was utilized and that the plan includes a long term view is that City Council adopt the plan amendments as a supplement to the Denver Comprehensive Plan. Thank you.Thank you. Well done, Abe filling in for our friend. We're going to call up our eight speakers tonight. That's okay. And I'm sure there will be plenty of questions. Maybe not at this hour, but so stand by, Joe Noble.First up, Cindy. Cindy Candy CdeBaca. Do not see her. Mike Duggan. Do not see him. Jamie Lynn Co. Jamie's back there and then bring up. Oh, no, no. Miguel is not here. John, he. Come on up. You each have 3 minutes.Go ahead, John.Good evening, counsel. My name is Joel Noble. I serve on the board of directors of Curtis Park Neighbors. The position for Curtis Park neighbors will be given later by John Hayden. Curtis Park Neighbors President. I served on the steering committee for this effort representing Curtis Park neighbors and wanted to give a few reflections on the process.The first is this is very rare that we amend plans enter neighborhood cooperation a couple of years ago adopted a zoning and planning position statement. That platform that among many other things said it should be possible to amend plans.Plans take a long term perspective and last 20 years. But sometimes things change in the public's view for what should happen. And it's going to take a long time if the public's view has shifted to see that reflected in a new plan.Well, how do we know that the public's view has shifted? It's not a problem that we have many different plans overlapping in this area. The issue is that the plans show an evolution in thinking. So if you were to go back in the slide deck, you would see that the very latest plans, the clearest wants a planthat comes down to 38th Street envisions up to 12 stories on that side of the street, whereas the plan right across 38th Street and again, this is an a mixed use area. I envision much lower heights, only five stories maximum.And you have to look at the at the total result of all these overlapping plans and say this was not thought through because they were done piecemeal and they were done piecemeal with disjoint map segments. And that points to the vision of the community evolving over time, but not being fully captured.And so we were able to take the public's call for the ability to have a plan, amendments with a clear, crying out for map amendments and do that here. The process was wonderful. I think they captured it at a high level.But because plan amendments are rare, we have visitors from other neighborhoods not in the area coming to see what was going on. Is, is someone getting away with something here? Is the public really being represented? And I think when they saw that lots of community members, residential neighbors were represented as well as the business owners and propertyowners, they were satisfied that this process was proceeding as it should and we stopped seeing them at the meetings. But it was good that we watched their processes are working right. I don't have a lot of time left, so I just wanted to finally touch on the visualizations, the the SketchUp visualizations that you saw.If you look this direction, if things were built to the maximum the current plans had, here's what your view would be. And in this new plan, here's what it would be were crucial to assuring neighborhoods. What are you buying into?What does it look like in the distance? Especially the whole neighborhood, which is the closest residential neighborhood to the platform? You'll see in your packet letters of support from all the residential neighborhoods nearby. And I hope you lend us your support.Thank you, Mr. Noble. Excuse me. Did you see Kennedy, see tobacco or no. Okay. Okay. We'll go straight to Jamie. Let's go.Good evening, counsel. Thanks for the opportunity to comment. My name is Jamie Lygo. I serve as the executive director for the Rhino Art District, the Rhino Business Improvement District, the Rhino General Improvement District. I'll keep my comments brief tonight, but I just want to say, first of all, thanks to Councilman Brooks, thanks to CPD, who did atremendous job, thanks to all the neighborhood participants that were involved in this process. It was an incredibly strong show of kind of community input and support for what we went through. You all know by now that Rhino is a place that likes to do things completely differently.They like to challenge convention, and I love that. It's a neighborhood that set the standard for trying to challenge the conversation and push. We are at the epicenter of urban growth in the neighborhood and we are a developing neighborhood.So we have the opportunity to do that. So I just want to say a couple of things about this that I saw from the process that the neighborhood really supports, just so you know. First of all, obviously, the affordable housing component is really important, but also the opportunity to use density, the density conversation as a way topush a conversation about what our neighborhoods should look like for people, for bicyclists from the public realm perspective, and how we can encourage transit oriented development in a way that also supports building neighborhoods that will stand the test of time as they develop out.And I believe this process has really addressed that in a really beautiful way. And the outcome we've gotten to is supported and celebrated by the neighborhood. And you can't ask for much more than that. So thank you very much.Thank you. Okay. Let's see who's here. John Hayden? Yes.Good evening. Members of Council. I am here as the president of Curtis Park Neighbors and I wanted to let you know that our board voted in favor of this amendment. In addition, we had a presentation at our general meeting done by CPD that was remarkable in that at the end of the meeting, almost all 50 people inthe in the neighbor that came to the meeting were like, Yeah, let's do it. So I was pretty excited that we have something that, that our community is fully behind here and we are coming to you saying, yes, please bring density here, bring affordable housing to our community.We want to see that happen. And so we support this.Thanks. Thank you. Can you say that again? I'm just joking. Let me get Andy Feinstein and Justin Grove.Good evening, counsel, and thank you for giving us the opportunity to speak this evening. I just want to augment a lot of the comments. Everybody else said, you know, we just we just witnessed a very robust debate and discussion on affordable housing.And as Jamie took one step back, sorry, I am the cochairman of the right now our district. I'm a resident business owner and property owner in the district. And I've been there for over seven years. So very invested in neighborhood.We just witnessed a terrific conversation on affordable housing. And as Jamie mentioned, we in Reno really pride ourselves on doing things different. And we believe that this opportunity to, you know, move on from the intent of all these plans going back to 2003, which was to have as much density as possible around the station.Unfortunately, when these plans were created in 2003, 2009, 2011, as Abe showed you, even then, the intent was to maximize density on the station. When they were created, no one foresaw 3000 people a month moving to Denver, the 4500 people a month moving to the metro area.So we believe and I know that to combat these challenges that we have, like affordability, like ground floor activation, we got to build up and we want to do this. You know, we want to do this at our station.And we've worked very collaboratively, very robustly with the public conversation to to get to this point. And thanks to Councilman Brooks, his leadership speed has been unbelievable. And our steering committee, I think we're there. So we welcome your support.We're excited about this opportunity. And hopefully Reinoehl can serve as a template for the whole city of how to incentivize affordability for other people to move down that path as well. So thank you.Thank you, Mr. Feinstein. Justin Kroft Last but not least.Thank you, President Brooks. I want to also echoed the sentiment that this was a pretty amazing process with multiple neighborhoods involved and I think great leadership from city staff, from Councilman Brooks and from the steering committee. My name is Justin Croft.I'm a resident of coal. I work in Reno and I was on the steering committee. I am the chairman of the Reno bid. I think what's so interesting about this process is this very easily could have been more of a technical exercise to align planning documents.It also could have accidentally been a way to just entitle a bunch of ground without anything tied to it. Instead, the community really prioritized this idea that we want to get the best parts of density and not the worst parts of density.And that takes a little bit of thinking around the policy that would be attached to adding extra density around the station. Some of the ideas that we talked about with getting the best parts of density were making sure that the district is walkable, that the population that is moving in is really supporting local goods and services.The idea is that they're buying art. They're buying beer from our breweries. They're supporting retail. They're supporting office. They're supporting services in the district, increase civic engagement, diversity of incomes and cultural exchange really happening on the street. These are markers of a vital urban neighborhood.Some things that can happen if you don't plan correctly, are more of a drive in, drive out situation. Vertical suburbanization, I like to call it. So the idea that you have these buildings around the transit center that people really are treating similarly to if they lived in a multifamily building or even a single family building out inthe suburbs, I'm not getting some of those benefits there by clogging streets. People are driving to every single kind of goods service job that they need. What is the benefit of really having that kind of density around a transit station in the first place?And if we're ending up with a more homogeneous population and not a more diverse population, it seems like we've failed in that regard to the ideas that since we always talk about building more density around transit to take advantage of it, if instead we're adding more cars to the street, we've probably failed in that.We talk about really wanting to increase affordability around transit citywide, and if in fact we're creating a more homogeneous situation, we've probably failed at that. So the idea behind this plan is really tying it to these two factors design with the idea being that you activate the street, you create commercial spaces on the ground floor that therebyreduce the need for everyone to have to drive to every good and service job that they need to attend. And then also requiring affordability, but making it a density bonus in effect, so that as a developer it's working better for you, or at least as well economically, while providing a great situation for some of the lower incomefolks that are at such a critical piece to a diverse neighborhood. So in closing, I just want to say thank you for the time, and I ask that you please support this.Thank you, Mr. Kraft. All right. This concludes our speakers questions by members of council. It comes from an article.So I am thinking, Mr. President, I'm. Trying to understand the direct interface with the other stationary of plans. So such as, you know, 41st and Fox. I mean, they're they're on the maps in these documents. And it's not clear if this particular bill tonight is having the effect of ultimately increasing the density in those areas without thosehaving to come back here. Yeah. Can somebody just.Councilwoman? I can do that. And even if I miss a beat, let me know. So these are just the neighborhood plans. This is the 30th in Blake's stationary plan. This is northeast downtown area plans, this Globeville or Swansea neighborhood plans.And we're amending those. So this has nothing to do with 41st and Fox and.Colorado and 40. So we're amending the neighborhood plans that address the issue of density as it. Affects the proximity to transit because that's primarily where we're going to be seeing the increase in density, right?Yeah. But I just I just wanted to be clear that we weren't amending the other station area plans, as you stated in your first question. And and I don't know if you heard Abe at the beginning, a lot of these oh, it was Jill Noble.A lot of these plans were conflicting with one another because they were started a very different times in the earlier global or Swansea. A plan in particular had, as Joel was saying, 12 on on one side of the street in a different.So what we were trying to do is say how can we bring some congruency to all of these plans together and in the process raise the question, are we at the right heights around this station area? Have we taking full advantage of this infrastructure?So let me just clarify that with an additional question. So it's because those neighborhood plans all in some way touch on the 38th and Blake that we're having to amend and update those neighborhood plans.Yes.Okay. Thank you.Councilwoman Black.Thank you. Quick question, Abe. It's just about the design guidelines. Is is that something that is required? Only to get the extra height or is it required for all the zoning in that?That's a that's a very good question. One thing that we heard when talking about the design quality was that it really was something that the community's looking for in the area, regardless of what happens with the height increases.And so there's a little bit of a distinction to be made with the integrated affordable housing where we're saying that's really about the the new increment of height that would be enabled and ensuring that when you're taking advantage of that, you're providing onsite affordable housing.The design quality is intended to apply to all projects in the area. However, it's quite likely that some of the specific design requirements would only apply to two bigger projects. For example, the tallest buildings might have the most meaningful mass reduction requirements and that kind of thing.Thank you. I think that's great. But the other question is, are they just guidelines as far as shapes and how dense they are and how whatever to step back or is it? Is there like a committee that reviews the architecture?No committee except that Reno kind of wants to have its own ad hoc committee. But really what we're talking about here to implement this plan will be effectively zoning requirements implemented through a design overlay, which is a tool enabled by the zoning code to apply specific standards to to a certain area.So there'll be there'll be quantitative rules.Yeah. Okay. Thank you.Mass reduction and things like that. Just to carry on. Don't. Councilman.You know, I was looking at the affordable housing about the regulatory approach. What are you are you talking about something different than the affordable housing now, or are you talking about something like inclusionary housing be apply there or or something like inclusionary housing applying to apartments for the first time?What are what are we talking about?EB I'm going to actually take this one.Because I think you're, you're the best person.This is one of the more complex ones. But now that we are passed this bill, we feel it gives us a little leeway to start to put this regulatory framework together. We did not want our regulatory framework for affordable housing to conflict with this bill.And so you will see both rental units and for sale units covered under this. And the way the way you do it is you incentivize if someone wants to go up to that, well, that's 616 stories. They will be able to do that for a percentage of affordable units.So be done with incentives and not penalties like the idea.Yeah, well if. Yes.Thank you.Yeah. Councilman Espinosa.I first have to apologize. She's not here. But Susan Sue Powers, because I didn't raise my hand when I was asked if I had any affordable housing groundbreaking. I couldn't remember. But I did get eight units, despite the total loss of affordability that we've had in northwest Denver.But to this I mean, this is this is a great tool. I really have a this question might be two. Like I would like to hear from maybe three of you that were participants. You know, you guys were both the beneficiaries of having plans that overlapped and needing this sort of discussion to sort of rewrite and revisitthese these plans. But is there anything in areas? So I'll just be frank. You know, we got the station area up at 41st and Fox Lake Councilwoman Ortega mentioned where we do have a stationary plan, but we don't you know, our plans are go back 30 years.And with with some vision about when we get around to it in the future. But is there anything in your process that you think that, you know, could could those be could these ideas and these steps be captured without having the plans in place, you know, because the outcome is valuable, invalid.And we do have some direction in our stationary plan. And it's important where where you're going with with this forum design guidelines and standards and the incentives for affordability that we capture that in in that area as well.If you've been paying attention and hopefully you haven't, we've had other discussions about Globeville and Forty-firsts and Fox and sort of the LAC, I mean, the constant rezoning, but the lack of tools to actually implement the vision of the Globeville plan.So having been through it all, you know, can we go from 0 to 2 this without having those incremental plans in place? And A, you can do it. But I'd also like the guys that did the the lifting from the community.Do you think the community is prepared to do that.As well as they're.Going.To turn it over to any of.You? I think John Noble and Josh, you guys want to just answer?I'll give it a try here. So the what happened here and why this happened here first is in a city that values affordable housing and is concerned about a lack of affordability, accelerating a lack of affordability in the Reno arts district, where the arts is in their name, they're seeing that artists not be able to afford tolive there anymore. That caused a coming together to say, we understand there's a citywide thing, the inclusionary housing ordinance that's been revised. We understand that there's a new and better approach being taken, but none of that is going to require that the affordability be right here and driven by the Reno Arts District, need to keep affordability, especiallyif it can be preferred towards artists. Maybe that's not in the regulations, but but encouraged that that brought the conversation here. First, it's my belief that if we figure out how to do incentives, zoning, right, where if you do this, if you afford this affordability, you get significantly higher development potential, then this is something we can replicate, adapt and learn from at other station areas because it's been commented on by council here tonight. It's it's a shame that although we're getting more density around station areas, it's generally market rate and being near a station is hot and so that gets bid up and there's not a lot of affordability unless you're lucky enough to havea nonprofit, do some land banking in that area. And then you get sort of one thing that's affordable, but you don't generally incentivize affordability. So I think this is a laboratory and we're going to try we've we've tried incentive zoning in Denver before, not too far from here, Arapahoe Square.There were far incentives that essentially nobody ever took advantage of. So we had a lots of discussions to say, how can we do this better? And part of it is not asking too much that people won't want to do it, but also offering a significant enough bonus.If you look at the difference between the numbers and the colors on the map on page seven, you'll see it's a significant bonus that we hope people will choose to take and have. The affordability not only happen, but happen here.Yeah, actually, you're the right person. And this is going to go to both of you guys. And this is not intended to sting, but I would like to have you guys on record. So there's both numbers. I mean, there's numbers and colors.There's checkerboard mean dashed lines, defining where those numbers are. How fluid are those lines? Because remember, we've had other rezonings where there's clear delineation on a map where people have negotiated and discussed where those where these heights are supposed to be.Now we're talking about where these bonuses are supposed to be. But if you have a developer that wants to cross that line, is, is that part of the plan?I'll try as a community member and then hand it to the office. These these were refined and refined and refined with multiple community meetings, and they moved by half a block. And if you look at some of the shading in the Cole area, on the right side of the diagram, you'll see them stepping down in these verydeliberate stair steps. So as a community member, I would be disturbed if if these didn't describe an envelope within which buildings were built.Great. I have that on record. Is that the intention of CPD as well?Yes, the intention is that this map guides future map amendments. The area in particular that Joel just described is one where, you know, there might be a little bit of interpretation necessary to decide exactly where the boundary is.But the intent is pretty clear that the development is stepping down towards the neighborhood and will be furthering that conversation. When we look at the tools that are in the design overlay as well to see exactly how that's going to be accomplished.Can I bring Justin up as well? Justin, we actually Councilman Espinosa, you're going to feel really proud right now. We actually had the conversation because you brought it up. Obviously, it was in my district when you brought it up.But we it was I want you to give your interpretation of a community's perspective in dealing with that developer who took that line further than than it had in the actual plan document.Sure.So you're talking about there's a developer I mean, you're talking about the same example between Larimer and Walnut Street. You know, you got five stories that stops Mid-Block, but the language is a little bit ambiguous. So on the one hand, if you've got a neighborhood that's not particularly.Organized. I think that can be a real negative because it'd be pretty easy to push that line. Fortunately, I think we have been having conversations for three or four years now about what livability looks like in our district and our tools to be able to influence that have been somewhat limited when it comes to development specifically andeven more specifically, more institutional type development that isn't modeled after more of a mixed use sort of format. So if you've got a community that really I think has its priorities identified and can use the fact that changing that zoning requires the developer to get the community's support or they're not going to get the community support vocally. It's actually a way to influence the design. So because we didn't have a design overlay and because of that full block development, I mean, it's a full block, it will have a massive impact on the community for its life for 50 plus years.So that development had no active ground floor uses its, you know, its active uses or the leasing center in the gym in the typical situation. So we were able to sit down with them and have what was initially a pretty difficult conversation, but actually turned into a fairly amicable one where we said, if you activate these corners, if you move your live work units to Walnut Street to help activate that space, because artists could potentially use those as galleries as well, then we will support this shifting of this line. And I think that the the way that the neighborhood actually lives shifting that line has less of a negative impact than four sides of adead block development. That's an entire city block. So but I think the prerequisite for that is that the neighborhoods already had the conversation, really worked out what its goals are, and then is able to use that tool to sort of implement those and influence the design.So I would say for the entire process, the really the same thing applies where, you know, the end result of this is there's value that's being given, there's entitlement that's been given. And so how do we capture it and make sure that there's a give back factor to the community or all the work that leads up tothat is what is that give back factor and why is it important? And how do you build sort of, I guess, unity around those ideas? So, you know, we started with neighborhood meetings with seven people in 2012 and said, what is regional look like in the future?What is a really urban, livable neighborhood look like? And right now it's a little bit of a blank slate and then tracked through a lot of those priorities over years. When faced with this opportunity and said there's an ask that there be additional height given we had the conversation, what is the tradeoff?What are the downsides of potentially giving away this density? And how do we turn this into a positive for the community?Are there plans? Is there is there language already in there or plan to be language that you can't even if you have ground for activation, that you can't have 100% residential development in certain locations?Or we are contemplating that for the design overlay.Okay, great. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilman. And thank you, Jason. Councilman Ortega.Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask a question of either Justin or maybe even Joel about. Whether the issue of train safety came up, where we're talking about adding, you know, higher densities of people adjacent to this particular, you know, station area where obviously there there's an interest to see more development happening.But the the issue of train safety is something that we've been talking about, particularly where we have, you know, these corridors that carry freight and specifically flammable liquids and hazardous materials. And so can somebody speak to whether or not that issue came up at all?And, you know, as part of this this big picture planning for this area. So if you do speak to it, it did not.But yeah, I don't think it it really came up. Joel, did you have anything you wanted to add or Andy?I mean, I understand the entire area is not next to the track.And Councilwoman in.The area where I mean, we know that that corridor, you know, will have development on both sides of those tracks. And so where we have development that will be happening adjacent to the tracks. I'm just curious to know whether that was even discussed, because it's a real issue.So, Councilman, you have actually we've talked about this, I think, for a couple of years now, and it's a it's a absolutely justifiable concern. And we did not discuss it. You know, if you look at the riverfront area behind Union Station, you've got development on all sides of those tracks throughout that entire area.And I don't see why this would be any different. So we just it wasn't something that came up in the course of our steering committee discussion.Well, and you need to know that those residents who live down in that area are some of the very first people who started raising this question as a real concern. And it would be different if we didn't have the kind of flammable liquids that travel through this city and oftentimes stage in the center of the city andmore frequently actually stage in this very corridor where we're talking about this development, where the potential impact to human life and property could be catastrophic, you know, with the wrong situation occurring. And so just planning appropriately for how we deal with that becomes really vital to ensure that we're doing our job.When we say we're truly addressing health, safety and welfare of the communities that we're going to, you know, encourage to live. And or work in these developments that happen to be right next to, you know, trains to carry these products.So I appreciate you addressing the question. I just raise the concern and we will continue to do that. We have work that was done by a working group that was chaired by our fire chief. We've got a report that was submitted to the mayor.We've got next steps to then meet with the development community before our agencies start to actually utilize the recommendations that came out of that. And so stay tuned. This issue is not isolated to this corridor. We have this challenge all across the city where we will have transit lines adjacent to these freight lines and where we willsee continued pressure for large and higher density development, where I think it's inherent or incumbent upon us to really be looking at doing the right thing.Thank you.Thank you. There's no more questions. A public hearing for Council Bill 760 is now closed. Comments by members of council. I call on myself. Why not? Right. It's 11:00. The last bill was the most important bill that I've been a part of.And since I've been on city council, this bill is probably. The most intriguing cool bill that I've been a part of. And here's why we had the number was actually 250 people at the meeting and there were architects, developers and folks from coal Curtis Park, Whittier, Gloria, Swansea during a time of Platt to Park here.So they actually showed up to the meeting upset and came by and came back in all of the tables that there were intermixed with all of these professionals. And we had one of the most fruitful discussions. And I think that's why you see an empty room and not pitchforks and, you know, everything else, because we really didhave a good conversation around, you know, we don't want to be bolder. So let's talk about heights because if you don't have the ability for density in a city. It's a supply and demand factor. And so your homes are going to be mostly expensive.And so we had a great discussion. This is not over. This is just the plan amendment. The last time a plan has been amended in the city of Denver, 90 to 91, I believe it is. So this is really cool.And we hope that we can continue doing this, that small area plans do get a chance to get amended, be amended for more certainty for for neighbors and business folks alike. So I will be supporting this. You will see us again at a legislative rezoning once the regulatory framework of affordable housing has been set.Once the overlay district of the design standard. When I got to I got to think, you know, Justin Croft and a lot of folks at Rhino for really working hard on that. But thank you CPD for your involvement.And if you hadn't done this before and I feel like you're super flexible. And Tim in Utah, Salt Lake City somewhere. Thank you, buddy. You've been amazing. Councilman Lockett. Councilman Espinosa.Oh, yeah. Just thank you to Abe. Thank you to Tim. If you're watching and CPD and all the stakeholders help get this hate amendment through. It was a real pleasure when it came to committee to see this, because this is exactly what we've been thinking we needed to be doing for a long time.And I'm a proponent for wisely incorporating density in mixed income developments near TOD sites. So I believe these height amendments are a step in the right direction along with your guidelines and standards that are in the future. So just well done, well done to CPD staff and the community and everyone involved.So thank you.AS Hear that. ESPINOSA Well done. All right, Councilman Clark.Thank you, Mr. President. Lots of talk about density and affordable housing. I just wanted to, before it got away, point out that what this does in terms of focus on the river, I think is unique in Denver and I think can set a precedent for how we treat the river and development that the river is not theback where you put all of your utilities and all of the bad stuff that we treat the river as a street, as a main street, as the front door to your building. And I think that's absolutely critical as we continue to revitalize and restore our river.And I hope that this is kind of we can all look back as we're walking up and down the riverfront in Denver for decades to come and say this is what really started not making that voluntary anymore, making that something that we as a city value and that we require.So I thank you for that. I'm really excited. Thank you, Mr. President.And thank you, Councilman Clark. Great comments, Councilwoman Black.I think it's really incredibly cool.And so kudos to all of you. And someday in District four, maybe we'll have one plan. Maybe someday we can amend it.But that Councilwoman Black, that was the perfect way to end tonight is remove to say Madam Secretary Rocha.Black Eye Clarke, I Espinosa Flynn, I. Gilmore, I. Herndon, i cashman. Kenny Lopez. I Knew Ortega Susman. Mr. President.I close vote. Announce the results.Councilwoman Black.Councilwoman Black. You are hanging fire keeping.39.

I've also had a request to move up item 27. So, Madam Quirk, please read that item.Communication from Council Member Pearce. Council Member Urunga. Council Member Richardson. Recommendation to request City Manager to work with Office of Equity to schedule a future presentation on the Equity Toolkit.Councilmember Pearce, you obviously.Thank you, everyone. And I want to thank Councilmember Richardson for the other item related to the Office of Equity Toolkit and COVID. I figured I'd save my comments for this part. We actually drafted this item before the COVID crisis hit us, really to try to highlight the work that the city has done over the last several yearsaround Equity. Our Office of Equity and our Health Department have done a lot of work in the community and with city staff already. They released a equity toolkit a couple of months back that the council has not yet had an opportunity to look at.And it really highlights the fact that Councilmember Richardson just mentioned, which is equity is when everyone has what they need to be successful. Well, equity is treating while equality is treating everyone the same. We want to make sure that we promote fairness and it can only work if everyone starts from the same place and receives the resourcesthat they particularly need. And so I think the COVID situation definitely highlights the fact that not only is it race age, and we know that some of our nursing homes have been the location where we've had the biggest outbreaks.And so these are examples for us to take to heart and really demonstrate that we as a city, as we are coming back and doing recovery, needs to have a full understanding of the toolkit, which really is fantastic.If you guys haven't had a chance to look at it yet, it really talks about what burden and benefits there are. How do we understand the data, community engagement, decision making and implementation? Accountability in a ways out of several questions.And they give examples for policymaking, how we do our budget priorities. And so my request today is that as staff come back and do a full presentation on this toolkit so that when we have other items come forward, WHITE Councilmember Richardson has brought forward we all already have a shared understanding of what that toolkit is and howwe can use it to ask questions as we are drafting policy and giving staff direction as well as how we are crossing our budget. And I think it's a particularly important time to do that. So I thank my colleagues for signing on.I know that there was a lot of support for this item previously, and I know we move quickly to get it on the agenda. So I appreciate everybody's effort and look forward to coming back with a full presentation for.And I urge your support.Thank you. Thank you, Governor Pearce. You didn't. You also just sent a Q in on the motion, please. We have a recorded and then camera angle. Very glad to look at the motion on this side of this. And it's very much needed at this point that we know what we're getting into in this presentation and what wemean by this issue. So thank you. Thank you.

I move that council bill 19, dash 1363 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.Thank you, Councilmember. It has been moved and seconded. The required public hearing for Council Bill 1363 is now open. May we have the staff report?Good evening, council members. I'm Liz Weigel with Community Planning and Development. This MAP amendment is an application for property located at 71017111 and 7125 Tower Road. I'll provide an overview of the application and staff analysis and more detail can be found and found in the staff report.The MAP Amendment application is located in Council District 11 in the DIA neighborhood. The subject property is located at the northwest corner of 71st Avenue and Tower Road. The property is approximately 80,000 square feet. It's occupied today by a one story commercial building.The site is just south of Penn Yan Boulevard and about seven miles from Denver International Airport. The site is currently zoned in our former temporary 59 district, and the applicant is requesting to rezone into the Denver zoning code and retain the airport influence overlay.The request is for the Max eight, which is a suburban mixed use eight story district in our suburban context that is intended to promote safe, active and pedestrian scaled diverse areas. The influence overlay is intended to reduce exposure and minimize noise impacts on residential and other sensitive uses.It will not permit residential uses on the subject site. As I mentioned, the existing zoning is CMU ten with waivers and conditions. This is a former Chapter 59 district. It allows a mix of uses with the waivers. Do currently also prohibit residential uses on the site.We have now mapped, but it doesn't apply to former Chapter 59 districts. The site is occupied, as I mentioned, by commercial uses today. Surrounding uses include commercial office, retail and vacant land. This is a view of the site where you can see the existing building and surface parking and surrounding vacant land and other commercial and retail uses. This slide shows an image of the existing building on the top left and you can also see the surrounding uses. The map was received in September. It went to a planning board in December where it received a unanimous vote to recommend approval.And today we have not received public comments on the application. I will review the five criteria for evaluating map amendments. The first is that it be consistent with our adaptive plans and we have our city wide plans and we also have the recently adopted for our northeast area plan in this area.But we do find that the MAP Amendment is consistent with several strategies and comprehensive plan 2040. This includes improving access to amenities, building a network of centers and corridors, and encouraging info which are consistent with our comprehensive plan.2040 goals and blueprint over this area is called a is the suburban context and it also calls us as having the DIA overlay, which blueprint recognizes as having additional restrictions in place. Blueprint Denver also calls. The site is within a community center, which includes a mix of uses and heights up generally up to five storeys.But Blueprint Number does say the area plans can provide additional guidance on height, which the partner these plan does in this area. Tara Road is designated as a commercial arterial and 71st Avenue as a commercial collector. The proposed district is consistent with the blueprint, Denver context, place and street type guidance.The property is within areas in Blueprint Denver. Denver, where we're expecting to see 25% of new housing growth and 20% of new employment growth. Blueprint Denver that recognizes that this varies in areas and places with how will see job growth and not housing growth.Blueprint Denver also recommends that we bring properties out of former Chapter 59 and into our new zoning code. I will now go over the far north east area plan where it also calls this area as the suburban context and recommends commercial development along main corridors and centers.It also calls this area as a community center. There is specific guidance in far north these plan, encouraging a mix of uses, community serving and many amenities and more pedestrian friendly design. We do find that the requested district is consistent with this context and place designation.Similarly to Blueprint Denver Partner, this area plan also gives guidance on growth areas. It does speak to the particular potential in these areas to add new jobs where we won't see residential growth. As I mentioned, the maximum height recommended for this area is eight stories, which is consistent with the proposed max eight district.And lastly, the plan provides neighborhood specific guidance for the for the day neighborhood and recommends creating a variety of centers and sees this area as an opportunity to provide new job and commercial development. And it does recommend bringing properties at a former Chapter 59 to help achieve the vision of the plan.The plan, the proposed site is also within an area where we have an adapted general development plan that comes from 1995. This plan states that the land use concept is to see business and hospitality uses, and it also shows a conceptual street and stormwater network.We do find that the proposed district is consistent with the guidance provided in the GDP with regard to criteria number for the application, identify as changed or changing conditions as the justifying circumstance. This includes the retention of former Chapter 59 Zoning and Adobe and the adoption of the New Far North East Area Plan, which calls for denserdevelopment. Lastly, the proposed rezoning is consistent with the purpose and intent of the suburban neighborhood context. The mixed use zone districts and the airport influence overlay. So with that, CPD does recommend approval based on finding that all review criteria have been met.Thank you.Thank you very much. We have two individuals signed up to speak on this item this evening. First up is Jim Irwin Sloboda.Hello. Council members, Jim Irwin supporter, the applicant's representative here tonight. And I want to thank Liz and her team for.The thorough presentation.And willing to answer any questions from you guys.Thank you very much. Next up, Jesse Pierce.Good evening, members of Council. My name is Jesse Pears. I'm representing for Denver Homicide Lao Black Star Action Movement for Self-defense parties have actually come here for social change, as was the only party of Denver and a universal African People's Organization.Denver chapter in Mile High North. And I'll be your next mayor at 2023. I had a few questions about this. I've seen numerous rezonings in this area, so this is going to be strictly commercial, correct? I want somebody to answer that question.This whole area is going to be strictly commercial. Everything south to 64th is going to be residential or is it all going to be mixed up? I would like somebody to please answer that question. Also, I would like to know exactly what is going to be here, because it's currently being a hotel is being put up herein office buildings. This is going to be an entertainment strip. Are you turning this into a promenade like you're doing Brighton Boulevard in District nine? I would like to know the answers to these questions because we have a housing crisis.A affordability crisis in this area does not seem to be the area where you are wants to concentrate any areas of poverty or low income. So I want to know if this is going to be strictly commercial. Is it going to be residential?It's going to be mixed use. I think the public would like to know, like what all these building codes, all this acronyms, all this stuff mean. So if someone could please answer the questions, I would greatly appreciate it.Thank you.Thank you. That concludes our speakers. Are there any questions from members of Council on this item? Council Member Gilmore.Thank you. President Clark. Liz, could you talk a little bit about the airport influence overlay and the restrictions that we have and why? Yes, the airport influence overlay is mapped to make sure that we don't have undue or negative impacts on residential uses and also to make sure that our airport is able to expand and grow overtime. So the airport influence overlay does have different restrictions for properties north of 64th Avenue and south of it, and this property is north of 64th. So it prohibits residential uses south of 64th. You can do multi-unit, but not a single one two unit uses.Thank you. And just to clarify, the 61st and Penna transit oriented development area, 64th Avenue to 56th Avenue is that area that will only allow multifamily. Along the tower corridor. That's correct. All right. But we do have that that map in our zoning code.And we do recommend that as rezonings come forward, that we apply the airport inference overlay. Perfect. Thank you.Thank you. Councilmember. Councilmember Ortega.Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate that clarification because slide 16 in the presentation spoke to 25% new housing. Understanding the overlay. So I think we could be a little clearer by saying the airport overlay supersedes any expectation for housing in that area.Yes. In both the blueprint Denver and the far Northeast plan, it groups those into those categories but has an overlay on it in those plans that says that these are areas where residential is not expected. Okay.Thank you so much.Thank you. Councilmember Councilmember Flynn. Thank you, Mr..Just a quick question, Liz. This is subject to a general development plan that dates to 25 1995. Is this the only parcel that's in that particular GDP? Because I see that the whole tower quarter has PBGC.And and this is not the only parcel within. It is a larger area that you can see on this map here. And there also are additional GDPs for this Denver International Business Center right in this area. So this is one piece of of one of the GDPs.It is a very simple GDP. It is a one page GDP that speaks to kind of the vision of it and the the street network in those pieces.Okay. Now, this is different than a planned building group. A PBJ?Yes. Okay.So we can with the changes we made with the LDR update last year, we can do a rezoning on a portion of an area that had been subject to a GDP.Yes. Council. Yes. So council can approve a rezoning for an area, a parcel that's within a GDP as long as they find it consistent with that GDP. It's different than a PWD, which is something that's a zone district that that that was a change that you also come before you of allowing someone to zone out of theircustom zone church checked into a new one. So a general development plan is more about the the uses and the layout on that that site.And we can change the zoning of a parcel within a larger GDP only with the with the consent only of the owner of that parcel and not necessarily needing the consent of the other parcel owners within the GDP.Yes. And actually, the the the zoning that's reflected on this GDP map is our older gateway zoning. So it's actually we have Series ten, which is different than the original zoned district.Thank you. That's all I'm really thinking.Councilmember seeing no other questions. The public hearing for Council Bill 1363 is closed. Comments by members of Council. Councilmember Gilmore.Thank you, President Clark. I will be supporting this rezoning tonight and I appreciate the applicant coming to the council office early on, briefing us and then attending community meetings, extensive outreach to the RINO's in the area and following the will of the community around the far northeast area plan.And I think all the criteria has been met and I ask my colleagues to support this rezoning. Thank you, President Clark.Thank Councilmember. And I'll just add to thanks staff for all your hard work on this and providing us with a great presentation and staff report.

Council will vote separately on each.We have the staff report.Good evening. Councilmembers Brad Johnson, Senior City Planner with CPD. I'm here and excited to bring to you the Denver Zoning Code Text Amendment Number five, which would create four new campus National Western Center zoned districts and rezoning proposal 2019 AI 104, which would map the Zone District in a large portion of the area encompassed by the NationalWestern Center Master Plan. This combined text and map amendment was initiated by CPD, but also in partnership with Mayor's Office in Western Sydney. So I'd like to just quickly, I'll do the rest of the presentation, but invite tigers to come say a few words quickly.Good evening remembers the council will take as Holloway executive director of the mayor's office National Western Center. Just really a couple of high notes. The National Assessment Team has worked hand in hand with community planning and development to bring this key and critical rezoning forward.As you know, this provides for a level of flexibility and allows us to activate the site to meet some of the key goals around supporting connectivity, the activations of of activities on the site, but then also the riverfront engagement.And so again, being relatively new into the position, we've got quite a few people from the team here that I'll obviously defer to and with Brad on some of the more specific questions, but we're really excited about moving this forward.Thanks.Yeah. Thank you. So just some housekeeping. Here we are in Council District nine. In the Elyria, Swansea City School neighborhood. So when we referred to the campus as a whole, we're generally referring to this area that's outlined in black here, so bounded by the South Platt Race Court, Brighton Boulevard and I-70, obviously with some pretty notable exceptions, particularly the Coliseum site. That area, of course, is bisected by the BNSF Railway. And that's generally synonymous with the National Western Center Master Plan area. The area we're here to talk to you about tonight is this area shown here, which is pretty much everything west of the BNSF rail tracks.And so that's generally synonymous with phases one and two of the campus construction we did. There are two notable gaps in this area that I want to point out. We did receive some questions, A, why wouldn't you rezone all of those properties?Right. One of them is fresh in your mind. Of course, the gap in the northern portion is is dry property currently. You know, there's ongoing litigation, no negotiations. Coordinated with that property. And so we thought at this time it made more sense to sort of not jeopardize or disrupt those those negotiations by rezoning the property at thistime. If when that property comes into ownership of the city, of course, it'd be a good candidate for for this for these zone districts down to the south, a couple of other properties quickly. One, the largest piece is the McDonald Farms property that is currently in ownership of an industrial property owner, and they're operating their business therenow. If we were to rezone their property at this time, they would become a non-conforming group, non-conforming use, and that the zoned districts that we're proposing are more restrictive than the industrial be that governs those sites right now.There also is a small sliver of BNSF Railway. They're probably too small to develop anything on, but it is also BNSF Railway property that would not be resolved at this time. So we're definitely here to talk about the zoning tonight.But I just want to show this slide as as a reminder of some of the big moves. Associated with construction of phases one and two and. We obviously talked about rail consolidation and relocation today. Wastewater pipes, major wastewater pipes along the river front buried.This allows an ability to establish a new street work in Betty Cram and National Western Drive, connecting in with the existing roadways. New facilities constructed, some of them as long as 1100 feet in length. So major, major construction of new buildings and event event venues bridges to Globeville to the West.An RTD rail stop soon on its way, and a pedestrian bridge that will get you from the campus over to that rail platform and vice versa. And then finally, construction of a riverfront open space community with the movement of those rail lines and the sewer mains.This is a look at the National Western Synod process as a whole, going back, starting with the master plan and I know there was a lot of work before then, but this is only how much I could fit on the on the slide and make it still legible.So starting with 2015, with the master plan and bringing us to today where we're getting close to our deadline via the framework agreement for having the zoning in place, particularly for the CSU properties on the site. So you see that little connection between the framework agreement and a few weeks from now, October one, 2019.The zoning work is outlined there in green and you see that sort of in place within the overall larger timeline of the project. So this zooms in on the zoning work itself as well as the design standards and guidelines work that's been conducted and developing that document.So we've been at this for a little over a year, lots of meetings with Citizen Advisory Committee along the way. We published a zoning strategy back in January, which is a pretty comprehensive sort of preview of where the zoning was going and but a little bit more accessible in the way that it was written.The idea is that someone would have an early opportunity to weigh in on the zoning proposals before it gets into the sort of legalese, red line language that you have before you today. Obviously, it's been a busy summer as we've made our way to this adoption hearing.So starting with the text amendment, I just want a couple hit on a couple of framework ideas behind the zoning. One is the streets are important in the way that development is associated with streets. And the way that they contribute to public space is critical.And it's no. Most critical on those portions of the street network that are connecting Globeville through the campus over eventually to Elyria, Swansea, as you see those portions of the Street Network outlined in green. Secondly, the river is to be respected.That means being careful about what uses we're allowing in close proximity to the river, ensuring that if buildings are built near the river, that they're set back sufficiently to maintain opportunities for circulation and things of that nature. And where a building is also built along the river that it actually engages the river, that means real architecture alongthe wall, not a blank wall up against the river, but transparency. Windows. Actual articulation. So to get out those framework ideas, what we're proposing in the text amendment is for new campus national Western Center Zone Districts and the Corps General Flex and riverfront.And you see those mapped here. This is the map that you'll see in your packet. It looks a little bit different than the one that I like to show. And the reason is that for the packet we have to map the new zone districts over existing conditions.But if you look at these maps, what's important is that they show the new street network that's going to be established out here. And that was a big influence of the zone districts that are before you so quickly walked through these first to start with campus national western center core.This is Main Street in phases one and two of the National Western Center. And so the zoning reflects that objective. You'll see many of the requirements that you would see in a main street zone district elsewhere in town.So transparency requirements, having buildings lined along the street. Active use requirements and prohibition of parking in close proximity to the street. So it's all about creating a walkable, pedestrian oriented corridor. There. Moving to the northeast, you have the campus nationalist from Center General District.That's an area that's going to accommodate some of those very largest facilities, like the one I mentioned, and that is close to 1100 feet long. And the livestock center, as well as the equestrian center in the plaza, that sort of runs through the middle of those two projects.Street Edge characters still important in there, and that it has frontage this area has frontage on National Western Drive, but more flexibility certainly with respect to land use, considering the type of activities that will courrier campus National Western Center flex.This is a zone district designed to accommodate those more support and service oriented uses that are going to be necessary to ensure that the campus can operate smoothly and efficiently in this area, you're going to see more sort of outdoor focused activities.And by that I mean the stockyards, for example, is in this one district, primarily outdoor activity space, the maintenance and operation facilities, storage, storage areas and things of that nature that sort of support the core of the campus.And then lastly, a campus National Western Center riverfront. This is synonymous with the areas that are planned to be open space amenities both for the campus and the neighborhood. The concept and intent behind this zone district is that it is intended to maintain this area as an open space community.It does allow limited development, but the idea behind is that any buildings that would be built there would be visually subordinate to the open space itself. So you see height limits and lot coverages are excuse me, building coverages and things of that nature.Science. I'll show you a map in a minute. Some of you may remember in 2015 there was a campus National Western Center Zone district, an initial one mapped in some areas of the what's referred to as the triangle.So east of the BNSF Railway. What we did for sign regulations was we borrowed the sign regulations from that original campus National Western Center district and apply them to these new zone districts. However, we also, with this tax amendment, establish a mechanism by which an applicant in this case probably a NewCo and or the authority, would preparea district sign plan that would allow flexibility above and beyond what's allowed in those baseline sign requirements in the zoning, provided that they prepare a district sign plan in that district. Same plan as approved by the Planning Board.Parking. We got some questions about this, I. I heard on the one hand. Why don't you do some parking minimums? There's not maybe not enough parking. And I heard on the other end of the spectrum, maybe we should have parking maximums.There might be too much. The answer to those questions is kind of it's complicated. I'll give you the short answer. And it's that the demand for parking at the National Western Center is changing every single day. It's changing week to week and it's changing event to event.So we explore the idea of having parking minimums and maximums when we haven't eventually looked at the numbers and landed on the idea of having neither maximums or minimums. Part of what helps out with that is that the National Western Center Authority will be in place.They will be the single entity managing parking on the site. And so this this approach allows them the ultimate flexibility really to manage parking on the site, as well as access to the site and parking opportunities potentially off site.So, you know, we'll get into the map amendment and you'll start to see some of the slides you are used to seeing. Um, so the mapping memo, as I mentioned, would map these four new zone districts. It should mention that the billboard overlay you oh two, as it's called, is mapped on these properties today.And we would retain that as as it is in place now. So quickly through the existing context. Existing zoning on the site is via industrial light IP, which is that heavy industrial and industrial mixed use five storey. Historic structures.There is, of course, the Armory Administration building, very handsome building here that will ultimately become the centerpiece for the the campus in the surroundings, of course, the 1909 stadium arena across the tracks over in the triangle area. There are currently no design standards and guidelines our design review.But this text amendment would enable design review for these districts and we have prepared in coordination with new code design systems and guidelines those that document is drafted and is available for review and has been for for some time.That design review process would be administered by CPD administratively and it is important to consider the zoning. In light of the design standards and guidelines. Another tool for ensuring high quality design and character. Existing land is out there on the side.It's probably changing quite a bit. There's vacant properties, there's parking, there's office and retail and the livestock exchange building, of course, and there's some industrial uses still operating there. Surroundings are generally industrial, more parking and then some of the entertainment and cultural uses associated with existing facilities that accommodate the structure.Building foreman skills generally this kind of low slung industrial utilitarian buildings, as you see in the picture in the top. There are some exceptions. I mentioned the livestock exchange building, quite a jewel there on the campus, shown in the picture in the middle.This is a rezoning. So I just want to take a minute as a reminder that the rezoning doesn't allow or permit any specific development as projects come through. Under this zoning, they will still have to go through the SDP site development plan review process and be any number of items looked at during that process.Freight rail and potential safety issues related to that is one of those considerations that may be relevant out here. And of course, traffic impacts and. Roadway infrastructure and things of that nature will be looked at as well as projects come through.These are the three credit criteria that we consider for a legislative map amendment like this and a text limit. So I'll go through those now. First is consistency with adopted plans. These are the five plans that. Correspond to this area.Starting with Play 2040. We found the rezoning to be consistent with it and that it will create or allow for the creation of a vibrant mixed use center and a people oriented place and will advance cultural tourism goals.The neighborhood context is urban center. Again, we found it consistent with this item in that there is rezoning will facilitate a significant employment area that will result in good street activation and connectivity. And of course with the pending rail line coming online will be served with high capacity transit.The future place type is a regional center and supports a high mix of uses. The rezoning would result in structures that are generally corresponding and framing those public spaces that there along and the heights that we're allowing in.All but that riverfront district I showed you are up to 150 feet in the river riverfront district. We're talking 40 feet max. So we think that's in keeping with the goal for taller heights in this place type. The street types.When Blueprint Denver assign the street types to this area, they assigned it to the existing roadway network, which makes sense from their perspective. Now, as we look at the campus, we have to consider also the Future Street Network, right.So there were two two streets. Well, two street types, I guess. First, Franklin Street, a suburb of it there, was identified as an industrial connector, which allows for kind of flexible placement of buildings and zoning, of zoning that would allow those types of building placements.So in the campus National Western Center Flex, we're certainly in line with the objectives of an industrial collector. I mean, look at Race Court and 46 Avenue identified as a mixed use collector. I think we're somewhat consistent with that.We meet the intent of an east west street that is a mixed use collector, but it doesn't happen as much on those streets as it does on the new streets that are going to be constructed with the campus.And that's very crim and nationalist from drive north. Growth area strategy is a regional center. So this is an area that's to accommodate lots of employment, growth and housing in this phase. Employment growth obviously is a big part of that.Walking through the plans. The Globeville neighborhood plan doesn't cover this area, but comes right up next to it. Along the river, it was very clear about objectives for connecting from Globeville to, uh, to the National Western Center and eventually over to Elyria.Swansea. Certainly the zoning will help to allow for those connections to be made. So we found that to be consistent as well. We found the result to be consistent with Illyria Swansea Neighborhood Plan. Its land use concept for the site is entertainment, cultural and exhibition.It calls for promoting heritage tourism, certainly in line with that says to establish maximum building heights to support arts scuse me, to accommodate redevelopment of the nationalist center. And then again, you hear this again. Improved neighborhood access and connectivity to the river.And lastly, the National Western Center Master Plan. I mean, this is our our guide for the campus. This sets the vision and objectives for the campus. And I think this rezoning is is one small step in achieving all of these objectives.I'll just point out to that are a little bit more direct in that the zoning will support engagement of the river and nature by the community as well as integration. Again, looking back to that original diagram I showed you that prioritizes those connections that go from Globeville through the campus.Elyria. Swansea. Further, the rezoning would result in uniformity of district regulations and would further the public health, safety and welfare of the community. So with that concluding presentation, we recommend approval of Text Amendment Number five and Rezoning Proposal 2019 i104.Thank you. All right.Thank you, Brad. We have five individuals signed up to speak this evening. If I could have folks leave that front bench open. And if I could remind folks to make sure and state your name and city of residence.We have Lance Nadin, Paul Andrews, Jocelyn Hill, Brad Buchanan and and Elizabeth. Mr. Nadin.Go ahead.Thank you. Members of council, for being here tonight and those in the audience. I'm sure everybody is either giving up Bernie or the opening game of the Broncos. So that speaks to your passion. Thankfully, I only get to speak 3 minutes, but I can't see.You will have to see the clock as as is my. I live a born in Denver, lived here my whole life. I'm currently residing in Greenwood Village. I'm a managing managing member of 4700 Brighton Boulevard, which is the future home of the Denver Police Museum, which I'm very, quite passionate about.My father died in the line of duty in 1971, so that's extremely important thing to me. Following the progress of the National Western complex over the last many years, it's very exciting opportunity for for not only the immediate business community around the national Western, but just the city as a whole.I don't think we clearly understand and I don't think I did until recently, the global impact that that that the national western complex will have in conjunction with the associated development in Rhino and down Brighton Boulevard. Its proportions is it's monumental, it's larger than than really I think any of us realized through its completion and it willhave a global impact with the changes in our society really over the last. And you know, by the way, I for one think good changes with how we we we train, interact, recognize deficiencies of the past and move forward.Being more theoretically of a political national political climate wouldn't indicate that at all. But things like the MeToo movement, as a one good example, I think that that we can't not ignore that that doesn't that doesn't impact development.We have a lot at stake here and smart, responsible, community oriented outreach development. And that's really what the National the Police Museum stands for. It's really outreach, outreach, how to align the community around it with the police museum.And that is in line with, I think, in my opinion, that all development should happen. I'm a big obviously a big supporter of the National Western redevelopment and all that it has to offer. But I don't want you as leaders of the community who have been so great in support of that initiative with the mayor, the currentcouncil and previous council members. I don't want it to get lost in how great this is in this vote tonight of 7 to 6 was absolutely stunning to me. On one side, it shows that democracy is in good hands.In Denver, Colorado, when you have something as powerful as the national western complex, come down to a 76 vote, which I, I can see both sides, by the way. I'm not taking one one opinion on the other. But but it just, again, emphasizes that things aren't just a given, that they're going to happen, but they should happenand they should happen the right way. And a community development responsible type way that leads this development project of enormous magnitude to be all that it can be, both to the world, the state and our local community. Thank you.Thank you. Next up, Paul Andrews.Thank you. Madam President. Thank you. Members of council. I'm Paul Andrews, the president and CEO of the National Western Stock Show. We reside at 4655 Humboldt Street in Denver. As you know, the Western Stock Show Association is one of three equity partners in the nation of Western Center campus.We are on track to meet our financial obligations to this project. Those commitments include $50 million in cash committed to the project and $75 million in land value, which is land the stock show acquired over the last 100 years.We paid our first 15 million last November and next May we will deposit 35 million to complete our cash commitment. We're also planning to build our own building on campus called the Legacy Building. We will buy the land and build the building all with private funds and expect completion in June of 2023.The rezoning under consideration tonight is a critical part of the overall master plan that the Council adopted in 2015 and the voters overwhelmingly passed in November of 2015 as ballot measure to see. In January 2020, we will be hosting 114th National Western Stock Show.Early entries are strong, with more than 40 states already committed to attend an anticipated economic impact to the Denver metro area this year of more than 115 million from January 11th to the 26th. I also want to share with you that we have started a new Denver specific college scholarship program called the National Western Denver Scholarship Program. And we're looking forward to the continued involvement with the neighborhoods and communities surrounding the nation of Western Center as we choose future students. The nation, western stocks. You and our partners. Thank you for all your support of the National Western Stock Show and the Nation Western Center Project.And we ask for your support in the rezoning tonight. Thank you.Up next, we have Jocelyn Hill.Thank you, Madam President, and members of Council. I am Jocelyn Hill. I am Senior Director of Sustainability and Denver Programs for the Colorado State University System. Our office is located at 475 17th Street in Denver, and I also live in Denver as one of the partners in the National Western Center redevelopment.Over the next three years, CSC will build three buildings focused on the themes of water, food, animal and human health and sustainability. These facilities will have both a local and global focus, attracting visitors to Denver from around the world, showcasing both the heritage and innovation of our city and state with an investment of $200 million.We will create spaces that host outreach and education to K-12 students and families through activities like field trips, camps and hands on education programs. We will support research on the challenges we face, both locally and globally, as well as linking youth to the scientists and policymakers tackling those challenges.We will support training and professional development to introduce Denver residents and visitors to new career and educational paths. Our Denver Extension Office will have a presence offering programs and activities that are responsive to the requests and needs of residents of the city and county of Denver, particularly our neighboring communities.All of this work will build upon. See us use existing collaborations with the schools and organizations that serve the surrounding neighborhoods. We have not been waiting for buildings over the last six years. CSU has built relationships and offered programs that range from an annual community animal health clinic to youth engagement activities to ongoing programs in equine assistedtherapy currently offered at the existing stock show complex. In addition, CSU will continue to collaborate with our existing National Western Center partners the Authority, the Western Stock Show Association, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science History, Colorado, Denver Water, and the City and County of Denver to create a platform for learning, arts, culture and convening that canalso be used by new partners who join us as the National Western Center evolves. This rezoning is the next step toward meeting our goals of opening all of CSU's facilities in 2022 so that we can offer new programs and host existing programs and a new home.Tonight, I'm here to ask for your support of the rezoning so we can meet that goal, begin this new chapter of the National Western Center, and achieve CSU's goals of enhancing education and outreach in Denver. I would like to thank Community Planning and Development and the Council for their continuing work on the National Western Center and supportof the project. Thank you and I will be available to answer questions.Thank you, Brad Buchanan and then analysts with.Thank you. Madam President, members of city council and Brad Buchanan, I'm the CEO with the National Western Center Authority. For those of you not familiar, the mayors of the National Western Center will design and build and have been standing in the gap for the authority for a number of years.The authority was formed last year and I moved to this post last October and were charged with operating programing filling, activating the campus over the next hundred years. I will not be doing it for a hundred years, but for years to come, I hope the the vision and mission for the National Western Center.I just want to quickly touch on those to be the global destination for agricultural heritage and innovation, to convene the world International Western Center to lead, inspire, create, educate, entertain in pursuit of global food solutions. What I think is most important about this next important step of the rezoning is that we've talked about the three partners tonight. I want to talk about the fourth partner. The communities around this project that that were situated within Globeville or Swansea and in the greater community of Denver constituents, even larger community of the urban and rural place that we're trying to connect.These are issues that are before us both and are relevant to our city and our citizens around food justice and food equity issues, but also around saving the planet and talking about global food production, soil health and other regenerative agricultural needs that are contributing to to climate change.There's there's a lot at stake. This is an important next step. You're going to start to hear a lot more from the programing efforts as they come to life here over the next number of years. This is not a typical urban development.It's a it's a once a one of a kind project. And so we're having to recreate new from scratch out of whole cloth at every step of the way. Thus customize zone districts here tonight before you that we think are relevant and important and ask and answer important questions that are important to our city and to theregion, to and to the planet. So I'm here to answer any questions, if you have any, and appreciate your support. Thank you.Thank you. Our last speaker is an Elizabeth.Thank you, Madam President. Members of the Council for the opportunity to address this. I would like to speak strongly in favor of these zoning changes, although I wouldn't say that they're being made from scratch or cut from raw cloth.I'm here to bear witness to the fact that there were long and detailed conversations to create the original New Zone Zoning District for the National Western Center that these are also continuing to be accountable for, which is why I support these, because I think it will support the business plan going forward.We do need to be vigilant with some of the flexibilities. One example allowing flexibility by goes above and beyond the baseline sign requirements. I do trust that part of what the awareness is going forward is that the baselines were developed in the original conversations of the larger district.I don't know all this the pre the preceding zoning district that had to do with the the constituency quality of life so that these the signage has the history of behind this has some very good conversation about what is the noise, what is the signage, light controls, what is the environment.And I really have great confidence that the people that are involved in this zoning conversation now do understand that. And the council as a whole, I think, can be unified in paying attention to the project to carry forward in the design with those flexibilities.And it's an ongoing conversation just as there was, just as there has been in many facets.Of.The development, the National Western Center. And as a member of the National Western Center Citizens Advisory Committee, that has been embedded from the beginning, although I'll be moving to a more emeritus position here, I do want to say that this zoning conversation, just like the conversations about the consolidation of the railroads, has been an ongoing, ongoing conversation, broad and deep. With due respect to the council member that said it was the railroad consolidation conversation was limited to the CSG conversations. If you would please when you have time reference the various wants your neighborhood planned that was adopted in 2015.You'll find 21 references to conversations about the railroad. You'll find historically that one of the RE connectivity pushes access to the density of jobs in the neighborhoods. Has to do with remedying the disconnect tivity that's happened with the railroad as historically.So thank you for passing that measure. I appreciate it. And I really hope that I have an opportunity to talk with each of you over time around the prolonged process of what the National Western Center emergence has been.Because I'm not a grassroots person. I'm a I'm an Aspen roots person. Those those those roots are interwoven. They're not individual blades. And I hope that we can get a greater understanding of what this tremendous project is because it will break silos.Think time is out. Can I have you restate your city of residents? Please tour.Globeville, the Near East 45, East 51st and Washington and I have lived at 47th and Brighton in the area as well.So thank you. All right. That concludes our speakers questions from members of Council on both Council Bill 752 and Council Bill 753. Councilwoman CdeBaca.Can you hear me? There you go. So thank you to everyone who's worked on making sure that we clean up this area and rezone out of the industrial uses that have really polluted this area for a long time.Activating the river is also a noble cause. We have recognized that this has been a very dirty river for a long time, and my hope is that this opens up the conversation to make sure we clean it up.I'm not super surprised that there aren't a lot of residents here testifying in support or against this. I believe we've displaced most of them. Make no mistake this for my colleagues, this is a project that is not for the neighborhoods.And I think it's become more and more clear over time. And while there have been people in the in the audience who spoke to the long and arduous process that residents were involved in, I'm sure you could knock any door in the closest neighborhood and find that people do not feel like they're connected, especially those who we'vedisplaced through eminent domain abuse and are actually going to use their properties for attractions in this event center. I do want us to recognize that these decisions have strategically painted a narrative that is misleading. When we look at the map, and I don't know if we can go back to either the current zoning or the second mapthat showed where houses are. Councilman. It's the second.Portion of the public hearing that are questions. Do you have a question? Yeah. All right. Thank you.So I'll get to the question, but I'm I'm making a statement right now. So we've painted a narrative about this project that it is connecting the neighborhood to the river. And while we are activating the river, if you look at the bottom right hand corner of this map where the yellow is, that is those are the closestresidences that exist. The diagonal line through the middle of of this image is the BNSF railroads. And that is where we're consolidating the squiggly line along the river to be in the future. And so what we've essentially done here is we have in the built form, this project has turned its back against community and we are talkingabout connectivity, but we don't necessarily have paid for linkages to community within these projects. And so while I support the rezoning because it takes us out of heavy industrial use and into something different, I do want to know if there are any guarantees that there will be funding for connections to community if we're rezoning under the auspicesof connecting community to the river.So some of that's probably a good question for newcomers, since they are more focused on on the development. I think if I think I understand what you're saying is is talking about connect connectivity from malarious mines here in the yellow area that you see there, that is going to be determined in the development of the triangle.As you probably know, if you look at the master plan, there's a very clear diagrams that indicate that a roadway will be established and that an underpass underneath that railway that you mentioned that links up to Betty Crown, the sort of centerpiece of phases one into would be established.So under when we talk about these plans or this rezoning being consistent with current plans and we recognize that the new comprehensive plans have equity and healthy communities all baked in, does CPD have any indicators of equity that they look to when they're determining whether or not a reason is in fact providing tools for equity?Yeah well I think that would Denver Blueprint says or Blueprint Denver says is that rezonings of this type of scale would be evaluated for their equity impacts and things of that nature. Of course, this rezoning was well along the way before Blueprint Denver was adopted, so that's why you don't see some of that analysis here, I think. And there are other people from CPD here, I think they could speak to this, but that sort of criteria and the ability to to examine rezonings and different scales of rezonings for equity is sort of under development, and I think you'll be seeing that soon with respect to this one, as I said, sort of like in thepipeline already. So that's why you don't see that specific analysis here.So it may be consistent in built form with what the plans say, but there are no indicators that show it's consistent with equity goals in the current plan.Not that we have in an analysis here. I mean, we'll just say that the a big part of equity, as it's stated in Blueprint in Denver is of course, a lot of that is about access, as you mentioned, the connectivity and access to open space and things like that.So I think those are things that the zoning directly speaks to. There are a lot of other things going on with the National Assessment Center beyond this rezoning that also speak to equity that I won't try to speak to.But of course there are many people here that could.So CPD has no criteria or checkbox to make sure that plans embed equity.Not for this rezoning.Thank you.Good, Councilwoman. Okay. Thank you, Councilman Sandoval.Yeah. So I have a question about, um, Councilman CdeBaca comment about displacement. I'm very familiar with this site. I've been. I worked in Judy's office since 2015. Does anybody know exactly how many people we have displaced? Because I thought we did eminent domain on only four or five homes.So can someone speak to that from the National Western Center or someone? I don't think you can, Brad, but can somebody answer that question? And also if it's possible to talk about it in the pre eminent domain process because they don't all make it there.But I just want to know how many places I know the question I'm looking for.I got someone. Thank you for that question. Brad Dodson, deputy director for the Mayor's Office of Best Western Center. I understand from the team we have acquired 38 properties as part as part of the campus, and ten of those are residential properties.Okay. And when they were with the ten residential properties, it went through the process where it was eminent domain and a market value study was done and they could have come back and rebutted that, just like with every eminent domain process.Is that correct?That's correct.And then did any of them end up in litigation or did all of them settle with the amount that you all negotiated?None of them ended up in litigation. They were all settled.Okay. Thank you.Thank you.All right. Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Ortega.Pratt. You might be the best person to answer this question. Yes, this. Brad. Sorry. What? What type of structures would need 250 feet heights on the campus? I would refer.To I would defer to Eric Anderson, our design.Manager, to come in.And answer that specific question.Eric.Can I can I clarify? It's 100.5150. Okay. I was looking at something that said 250 and I just wanted to clarify that. So thank you for that.Eric Anderson from Centennial. I'm the design manager.For the mayor's office of the National.Western Center.Again. As others have mentioned, this project is truly unique, particularly in the types of buildings that we are building. Although some of.Them are one story, they may be.Much taller than an.Average building because of the uses.And the events that will have to happen here. Things like arenas and barns need.Lots of space.And lots of clearances to make those work. So to.Be able to allow for those.Types of structures that 150 feet has.Been set to be able to allow that.Okay. And any rezoning beyond this particular area. So east of the railroad tracks, south of I-70. Those will come at some future time.That's correct.Okay. I also had a question about the 48th Avenue connection from Elyria to the site. This this this campus has always sort of had a Brighton Boulevard facing entrances, and it will now have a west facing entrance towards the river.And it wasn't until I don't know, I would say in the last couple of months that I learned that the connectivity in Phase one doesn't go all the way to Brighton Boulevard. And and so I share that concern and I've expressed that to the National Western staff.I know that's being proposed as part of what is anticipated with a private partner coming to the table to help, you know, do the build out of the next buildings, the next phases of the campus that are not funded with this first phase.And I guess I'm in comments now, so I shouldn't I should stop, but I just want to share that that's a concern as well.Thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Hines.Thank you, Madam President. Pro tem. I'm a little concerned that there was nothing about equity. I think I'm a little concerned because that's you know, one of the things that we're supposed to do is measure things today, right?We're not supposed to come to any sort of conclusion before today. And as I look at comp plan 2040. Which we're supposed to use as a as a guiding document. It talks about equity. It talks about equity multiple times, actually equitable, affordable and inclusive.It talks about why measure equity. And then also in Blueprint, the number one of the six vision elements is equitable, affordable. Inclusive. So. I'm kind of at a loss because I didn't do as much research on Blueprint or or for this particular item, because I just assume that you met all the goals and that's that's my, Iguess, penalty for not being on LUDI and following LUDI closer. I want to give you another chance to like maybe you've come up with something between counseling and setbacks questions. And now that it's really you don't have anything on equity other than eminent domain on 22 houses which not exactly equity and and that you haven't considered equityat all that that's really concerning to me because that is a core tenant on both blueprint and component. 2040. So do you are you sure you're not considering equity at all.For a I shouldn't say we didn't consider equity. What I mean by that is we didn't do an analysis in the staff report because of the timing of adoption of blueprint number and so on. Part of the equity goals that you mentioned related to uh, providing housing opportunity.I want to point out one major difference here between the zoning that we're proposing in this area and what's there today. There's industrial light, and industrial heavy zoning does not allow housing. Right now, the zoning that we're proposing for the site in this portion of the site will open up the site to the potential for housing.That's obviously not in the program and funded portion of phase one and two. But from a zoning perspective, it certainly opens up that opportunity. And I think that's an important thing to note. In addition to the things that we mentioned about access, uh, access to open space, access to neighborhood and so on.Okay.Hi, I'm Sarah Showalter, citywide planning manager for CPD. And I really appreciate the questions that both yourself and Councilman CdeBaca have asked tonight, because you're right on equity. The reason there's a reason why it shows up first in the comprehensive plan is the first vision element, because we heard strongly from the community when we were working onDenver. Right. That of all the vision elements, people really felt that was the one that we needed to commit the most to and double down on if we want Denver to. So be the city that's so rich and inclusive that it is today.So I appreciate you asking these questions and a couple of things I want to clarify. I think first, related to this particular rezoning, there are a lot of components that Brad's hit on that are about advancing equity goals.It is very much part of the plans that were adopted by City Council before Comprehensive Plan 2040 and before Blueprint Denver. So those those more areas specific plans like the neighborhood plan and the National Western Center Master Plan don't have as much as some of our future plans may about equity, but they still reflect a lot ofthe same values and goals about wanting to create something here that responds to what the community wants and adds amenities for the community, bringing things in that this community hasn't had in the past. Open space is a really big one.So I do want to emphasize it's not the equity is not part of this rezoning or part of the philosophy. It's very much part of what we're trying to accomplish with the rezoning. However, Brad's correct that this process, which is I don't know how long exactly it's been, but it's been very long.A lot of how we're thinking about how we can more formally integrate equity analysis into large rezonings like this starts at the very beginning of the process. It's about the scope of the whole analysis that you would do around what are the things that we might be considering that we wouldn't have otherwise if we don't have equityat the forefront? And like Brad mentioned, we're working on how to change some of our processes, including large scale rezonings and amendments to the zoning code, to do a more formal analysis and more recognition of that key goal.And so the great news is that that will very much influence the triangle component that still is not part of this project, but will be in the future and will go through a rezoning. We should have that process in place and I am really hopeful you'll see a much more kind of formal, like Brad was saying, integrateddatabases, you know, blueprint. Denver actually has three equity concepts. One of those is about access to opportunity. One is about vulnerability to displacement, and one is about housing diversity and jobs diversity. And in areas like this, we're working on something geographic specific.We plan to look at how an area of scoring in each of those three equity buckets and use those scores and where there's challenges to influence the outcomes. So that will be very much part of what we get to do with phase two around the triangle.And that's even more important because that's the portion of the campus that's closest to the neighborhood and where that can be the most opportunity for connections, as Councilman CdeBaca brought up, but where there's also the most impact to this to the surrounding community.And even more important, to make sure we have more of that equity analysis figured out and know how to influence the decisions that are being made based on that. So I hope that provides a little more background kind of where we're headed and what you all will see coming before you in the future when it's not arezoning like this, where the majority of the work had already been done at the time those those plans were adopted. But I also want to reiterate, again, feel very confident. These are just like you said, it's part of your criteria.Like one of the biggest ones is are these consistent with our adopted plans? And we feel really, really strong that both the MAP amendment and the tax amendment, especially because they're advancing the neighborhood plan in the master plan, are advancing some key goals around how do we improve equity and access in this area.And I hope we can do even more robust analysis and conversation when we get to the triangle component.Can you or somewhat not necessarily because you didn't give the presentation, but would can we go back to the the slide that talks about the plans you use as metrics, the guides.Oh, yeah. It's very.You know, it's at the very beginning. This one concerns consistency with the adopted plan. So comp plan 2040 Blueprint Denver 2019 are two of the five plans and and that makes sense because city council actually right before we took office approved both plan 2040 and Blueprint 2019 and that was before today.So it makes sense that we're comparing to current plan 2040. I just I just wanted to make sure that it was on your list. So thank you for for having it on the list. I'm a little concerned about just trust us because, you know, eminent domain doesn't really share suggests to me that there's been a commitment to, you know, making sure that the neighborhood people can age in place and people can have access to. So and Denver has had an unfortunate past of not developing in an equitable way. So I'm a little concerned. I really like the the I like the idea.I mean, you know, the National Western Project I really like I'm not certain that I really like just trust us or your answer before of we didn't consider equity when there are two of the plans that that's the number one issue or excuse me the number one criteria.So thank you for your time. And thank you, Madam President.Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Ortega.Yeah, I just have one last question. And either Brad or Titus, if you could come up to the podium, I don't want this conversation to be left assuming nothing or no commitments have been made around addressing some equitable issues.So I would like you to speak to commitments that have been made around apprenticeships and hiring goals that will be part of the ongoing construction, the next phase of of building out national western. Talk a little bit about the commitment that was made to the Community Investment Fund, community benefits that are in discussion stages with the communityright now. I think it's important to just not presume that those things have been completely left off the table because they have been very much part of the meetings with the community and commitments that have been made by National Western Center.So sure, you can take us all away. And I think that also goes to the commitments that are made by the partners as well. I think we heard about what CSU and the stock show, but also what the authority plans to do.You know, I think one point of just a comment and clarification on I think what I'm hearing tonight is not necessarily that the plans that are moving forward did not consider equity, but where are we consistent with? And so I just think that we need to be a little bit clear on as those plans were developed, theygot to the zoning, what components are still consistent with the equity platform that we are pushing forward in our neighborhood plans and through the comp plan. And we'll have to come back to that that conversation at some point so that we can, I think, settle up on that.So to the question at hand, yes. So, you know, the zoning side is the play space. That's the sort of the physical, the the mapping of. And yes, connectivity is part of that. And duly noted that the team continues to work on trying to find out additional ways to to make sure that connectivity to and from theadjacent neighborhoods is at the appropriate scale so that we're not having as many people coming to events that are accessing the location via the roadway network that are not the best for that type of travel within the neighborhoods.And so it's a balance and I know we've been looking at that and including with Betty Cram and future phases of how to make sure we're connecting better to the east while we're adding additional connections to the West.And the connections on the campus are complicated. It doesn't answer the question around equity, but because of a lot of the utilities that are on the site, the river separating it, the infrastructure and the clearances that are required often will impact both sides of the roadway.So we're very sensitive of providing enough access, but also not having so many transportation facilities that it limits the use and usability of the site. So fast forwarding into what the commitments are. So the National Western team was one of the first in the city to really push forward in an equity conversation around workforce.And so the horizontal integrated contract was really the first steps for the city and a workforce conversation. And since then we've moved forward into exactly what. You were mentioning requirements around apprentice apprenticeships within the construction phase. And so what we're looking at for our upcoming procurements is adding in that language that has been presented in other majorprojects in the city with the lead of Dito's Workforce Services and CBO on the small business front. And so there are specific requirements on the construction side. And yes, there is a map that Dito had has created that does focus in on the the inverted EL, if you will.So the west side, north Denver and far northeast zip codes that are in the highest need and demand of of economic opportunity. And so we've partnered with work now as part of this. And Nucor was one of the first sponsors, our first entities to help fund the Work Now program, who has been doing some really good workaround training and getting opportunities for individuals. One of the first things that I'm looking at is to make sure that we're focused in on the right things so that those access to opportunities, which is one of the equity components that comes out of the master plan, starts to get the focus in on what we need to dohere. I'm learning a lot of great things about what is happening that's positive. And as you and I have discussed, Councilmember Ortega taking that opportunity to look at other ways to make sure that we're increasing that those that are entering into the construction workforce.But I will say that's what's happening today. The other big focus for this campus is what happens in the future. And that's where Brad Buchanan and the authority and Paul in the stock show have been looking at, focused on opportunities where it's career opportunities within the operation and the maintenance of the campus that lasts more than theconstruction phase. It looks like I'm in the red.Thank you. Thank you so much.All right. Thank you, Councilwoman. And you don't have to follow that. Take us. So that's okay. You keep talking. Councilman Hines.Thank you, Madam President. Pro tem. And I'm sorry, I have a question about apprenticeships. So just as you continue conveniently sat down, I apologize. The you I think I heard you say that in future projects you'll add an apprenticeship component to the contracts.Is that is that what I heard?Yes.Okay. For the construction phases of the livestock center in the equestrian. So there are two last procurements that we have for the animals.And would you also agree to to have those apprenticeships programs be or have the requirement be that the apprenticeship programs are recognized by the Department of Labor? As in there, they're actually approved. Apprenticeship programs already.Are.Yes.Thank you. And so okay, so two other things. One question. If we vote no, that means that this just doesn't go forward and we get another chance to look at this. Is that correct? And that's not necessarily for you.This is a procedural question.We'll go ahead and turn that over to the city attorney, Kirsten Crawford. Or do we have somebody.Like we don't we're not killing? Does the the proposed zoning amendment. We're just saying not today.Kirsten Crawford Legislative Counsel I'm actually going to defer to Nate Lucero because he and talk about the TOS applications and then our code requirements with respect to Blackout and then I can fill in if there's anything else.Good evening, Services and City Attorney. So if you were to vote no on the text amendment and the map amendment, it would essentially send this back to the drawing board and you would be saying no to what's being proposed to you this evening.But we could theoretically even look at this again next week, right? I mean, that's I guess what I'm I'm trying to come up with a way to say, hey, let's give you a week or whatever to go back and, you know, to go back to CBD and say, Oh yeah, we do have equity things.We just didn't have the right people here tonight to address them. You see the nature of my thought process.Councilman Hines This application has been through a very long public process. It's been to the planning board, it's been through the committee, it's been through first reading. And now here they're they're here now for the public hearing. So there's been plenty of opportunity, both in the public and through the processes of the city for questions like thisto be answered.And so how come you can't answer it?Well, tonight's your opportunity to vote it up or down. If you're not satisfied that the application doesn't meet the criteria, that's counsel's prerogative.Okay. And the last thing I would say is certainly when in presentations, I would ask that CPD include some of the components, including equity, that are core tenets of the plans that we're supposed to use to judge text amendments and zoning changes.Thank you, Madam President, for them.Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Sandoval.Yes, thank you. Sara Showalter. Can I have a question for you? So when map and text amendments come forward and they're voted down, is there not a one year blackout period until the property can come forward for a rezoning?Yeah, good question. There's just discussing with the city attorney. Yes. So you're correct. If you vote no, if city council denies a rezoning, then the typical process is that there's 12 months correct before you can apply for the same zoned district.But as the city attorney was pointing out, this is a little different because that if you also voted no on the text amendment that's creating the zone district to which the application is for, and now that zone district wouldn't exist.So actually probably could come back sooner with that zone district and then ask to apply to it. It's a little different than a typical rezoning where the zoning district is already on the books.Okay. Thank you.Yeah. And I'm sorry, Ryan, I just I really do want to reiterate. I want to be clear on the message. All of the rezonings that come before you when we recommend approval, it's because we feel like we've met all of the criteria and all of the adopted plans.It's a it's a very comprehensive look. When you're thinking about a site like this, we're looking at are we consistent with all of the adopted plans, like in their totality, which, as you can imagine, is a lot to kind of digest when you have five plans like this one.But there are other rezonings that have come forward since Blueprint Denver Comprehensive Plan 2040 were adopted that are also in this. A little bit of an awkward to be frank you know timing thing here where we weren't starting to implement what does it really look like to have a large rezoning go through a more formal equity analysisuntil we knew the plans were adopted and now we're trying to catch up as fast as we can. But projects like this that have gone through the majority of the work prior to adoption of that new citywide vision are in that awkward phase.But I do really want to reiterate, it's not that we're saying, you know, trust us or that there wasn't any equity analysis done. And it's it's not part of the analysis. It very much is. I think we feel really confident that what this rezoning would do in terms of really changing a very heavy industrial area into amixed use area that's going to provide a lot of amenities and realize the vision for a community in an area that has really struggled and had all the heavy industrial is very much part of a more equitable Denver and a more equitable future.So we we do feel strongly, even though we may not have the same level of rigor, we will in future large rezonings that it is definitely consistent with the adopt a comprehensive plan and blueprint number.The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council and Council Bill 752 and or Council Bill 753. Councilwoman CdeBaca.Thank you. My comments are that I don't wish to stop the rezoning of this project. I think that we have to. I think tonight it would be a mistake not to advance this rezoning. But what I do want to make clear is that council has our eyes and fresh eyes with a new plan on equity and onCPD and on what we're expecting when we say something is consistent with the plan, because if it does not have that primary indicator that if we don't figure out indicators for equity, that we can literally check off, see and understand in.In a way that's going to be manifested not promised. Then they are not consistent with plans. And so for this situation, I do think that we have let the belt form turn its back on this community. But this community has been disconnected from this part of the city anyway.And so what I think this means for CPD and for a NewCo is that you have to pay special attention to what happens to the triangle and there has to be extra attention to undo the harm that may have been created by this zoning and not prioritizing equity.When we do the triangle. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Hines.Thank you, Madam President. Pro tem. So I recognize that you guys have been working on this for a long time. I recognize that you've had many presentations to a lot of people, including Rudy and Planning Board, and now we're here today.I also recognize that that there's some growing pains with with this started before Blueprint Income Plan were approved. We, too, are I mean, there are five of us who are new to council, and we also are having growing pains.And so, I mean, in some ways, I kind of feel like I'm caught with my pants down. They're not out. But, you know, it's a little bit of a concern. Just I would agree with Councilwoman CdeBaca. I think it doesn't make sense for this not to go forward, because I.I believe that that you've had a lot of vetting. I also don't want you to coast through city council and bebop through and think that we're just going to rubber stamp stuff. And I'm not trying to say that that's what's happened in the past.But I don't want I mean, I want to make an informed decision and I'm going to get beat up if. Tomorrow. I mean, you know, I vote for this and people are going to say, well, why didn't you consider equity?You're going to beat me up tomorrow. And and, you know, so I have a constituent who I know is going to email me either later tonight or tomorrow about equity. So. I just want to make sure that we're we're being thoughtful and I assume that you are, but it's not our job to assume.It's to make sure that it meets the criteria. So thank you so much for all the work that you've done. I'm not trying to not trying to beat you up. I'm just trying to make sure that I make an informed decision.So. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman. Councilman. Woman Ortega.Thank you, Madam President. Pro tem. I just wanted to. I speak in support of the application. And yes, there has been a lot of work that's gone into getting this project to this point. It's it's been around for several years now in the works, trying to get us to a place where we can, you know, get thesite ready for new structures to be built. And, you know, I'm excited about the commitments that are made to the workforce, knowing that there are well in excess of a thousand people in the pipeline right now, many of whom are working on different projects across the metro area in the skilled trades that they chose to be trainedin. And that's important, especially for people in these neighborhoods who can take advantage of these livable wage jobs and be able to have a solid career path and afford them the ability to stay in the neighborhood if they so choose, if they're a renter, or to potentially become a homeowner, if they're a current renter.And I think that is one very important component. It's not the only social contract, if you will, that is tied to this project. The commitment that's been made to the scholarships, I think is is really important as well.But this is a project that this city made a commitment to a number of years ago, that we want to see this done and see it done right. And, yes, the connectivity is critical. And part of the reason the Eastern connectivity is vital is because that is part of the linkage to the rail stop that's on thecampus. And if people from the neighborhood can't get there because there are the right connections, that's a problem. And that's why you've heard me be noisy about making sure that we're addressing that as quickly as possible. So but I think this project is one that is is going to be one that we will all be very proudof. And we've got a great team of people who have been working very hard to make sure that all the pieces are in place and to work to address the community concerns. And does it mean we've gotten everything right?I think we've got a ways to go on some of these issues. But, you know. This phase will actually see some of those those social contracts be materialized. We're not having to wait for phase two through eight to to see those things happen.Yes. When the triangle gets built out and that comes back before us, we will see those very clearly spelled out as well. So I will be voting for this tonight. I think it's important for us to move it forward.Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Ortega. And seen no one up in the queue. I will go ahead and make my comments. I appreciate the conversation and the questions of my colleagues. Equity is something that we talk a lot about in the city, but we don't yet have those tools that we can show our constituents and that we can evenshow council members without, you know, a shadow of a doubt that we have considered all components of equity. And I look forward to those documents that we can actually show how decisions are being made instead of, Yeah, we did it, it's a check mark, but really delve into it and having access around, you know, equity and accessto opportunity, transportation and mobility. There's a whole laundry list of what we need to do. And so I appreciate the conversation. And, you know, what my my colleagues had mentioned. That being said, Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 752 place.Black. I see tobacco. Yes.Flynn.I heard it. Hi.Haines.Hi.Cashman. Ortega Yes. Hi. Sandoval. Hi.Sawyer, I. Torres, I.Madam President, I. Madam Secretary, closed the voting and announced the results.11 Eyes.\nSummary:", "answer": "A bill for an ordinance relating to the Denver Zoning Code to establish new zone districts that implement the objectives of the adopted 2015 National Western Center Master Plan.\r\nApproves a text amendment to the Denver Zoning Code to establish four new zone districts referred to as Campus-National Western Center-Core (CMP-NWC-C), Campus-National Western Center-General (CMP-NWC-G), Campus-National Western Center-Flex (CMP-NWC-F) and Campus-National Western Center-Riverfront (CMP-NWC-R) in furtherance of implementation of the National Western Center Master Plan and Globeville and Elyria and Swansea Neighborhood Plans in Council District 9.

Now we're going to move on to item 29 with the clock. Please read item.Actually Item 29 Communication from Councilwoman Gonzalez, Chair Tidelands and Harbor Committee Recommendation to direct City Attorney and the Board of Harbor Commissioners to explore ways to address the protection of proprietary interests in Labor Code violations at the Port of Long Beach and City Manager to report back on the impacts of SB 41402.Thank you. Could Noelle please come up and speak on this?Good evening. Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. Members of the City Council and the well, Hasegawa, deputy executive director at the Harvard Department. I want to begin by thanking you for the opportunity to provide a brief report on the Harbor Commission's hearing that took place September 26th.The request of the Harbor Entitlements Committee. The Harbor Commission conducted a hearing on September 26th to explore ways to address the protection of proprietary interests and the Labor Code violations at the Port of Long Beach. A memorandum summarizing the hearing from Harbor Commission President Tracy Agus, who was also in attendance tonight, was provided to the mayor andthe city council last Friday. During the hearing, the Harbor Commission heard a staff report as well as testimony from representatives from the Teamsters, Senator Ricardo Lara's Office. Harbor Trucking Association. The California Trucking Association. A truck driver and two of our marine terminal operators.Long Beach Container Terminal and SSA Marine. The testimony and discussion focused on truck operations, efficiencies and driver misclassification. The city attorney's office also clarified that the Port of Long Beach has very limited abilities to act on the issue of driver misclassification due to federal preemption on truck regulation outside of safety, security and environmental issues.In spite of this, the Harbor Commission recognizes the critical role that truck drivers play in supporting port operations and the gross inequities involved with truck driver misclassification. We believe that Senate Bill 1402 provides a critical new tool that could be instrumental in addressing and possibly ending truck driver misclassification.In addition, the Harbor Commission and port staff are diligently pursuing multiple additional avenues to address the problem, including requesting action from the Attorney General. Actively monitoring judgments issued by the Labor Commissioner on misclassification. Working with city staff to take action against business licenses when that options are available.Engaging neighboring municipalities to take similar actions. To revoke business licenses in their jurisdictions, engaging stakeholders and working with them to develop business solutions and exploring potential state legislative solutions. Concurrently, the port will continue to focus on improving efficiencies and reduce truck turn times, as this is also a critical component in the success of the dredge trucking industryand for the truck drivers. In furtherance of this, the Harbor Commission directed the following actions during the hearing. The Harbor Commission's Subcommittee on Efficiency, which was established last week, will continue the review of truck driver misclassification issues to identify any additional actions that can be taken by the port to gain compliance with state laws.This subcommittee will report back to the full commission with their findings no later than the first of the year. The Harbor Commission and port staff will continue to pursue ongoing plans and explore new suggestions raised at the hearing that will also improve efficiencies and working conditions for truck drivers servicing the Port of Long Beach.This will include a review of appointment systems, chassis management and uses of land to support truck operations. And Mr. Vice Mayor, council members, this concludes our report. As mentioned, the president of our Harbor Commission, Tracy Gasgas, here in the audience, as well as several of our staff members.And I also want to recognize Deputy City attorney Don Macintosh who was very helpful in helping us to formulate are hearing.Thank you very much. Is there any public comment on this item? And please state your name and you have 3 minutes.My name's Zoe Nicholson. I live in Rose Park.Good evening, Council vice mayor. And in particular, the audience, of course, there the primary reason we are here. Over these past few years, I've stood with the port workers and those seeking to work in the port. I prayed with them and I've spoken on corners in support of them.I've spoken to the commission and the Harbor Commission. And now to you. I want to tell you the truth here. As I told the Harbor Commission. This is too much power for you to hold. When you look at each of these workers here tonight and you think of them standing out in the street and strike, I askyou to see that they are representatives of an entire family. They want to work hard, get paid fairly, feed their kids, and some just.Want a few dollars.To send people who live in other places. It's not moral for you or anyone who has a vote to vote on this. It's not meant to be personal. This applies to all issues around equity and equality. The very idea that we vote on these things is immoral.What we are being denied here, what they are being denied here is the minimum of that human being should have and it should not require a vote. And then add insult to injury, you most likely already know how you will vote and we really are lining up in front of you to assuage our own consciences and tellour truth. Well, here's my truth. These workers have no campaign funders, no business allegiances to consider. They are simply representatives of their spouses, their children, their parents. I stand here on a regular basis asking for a vote. And I want to tell you that I come from a darkly conservative family that lives in the mindset of scarcity. They believe that if workers, people of color, LGBT people and women get full rights, it will reduce their slice of the pie. I argue with my brother constantly and I tell him, All we really want to do, Fred, is build more bakeries.All these workers want is the dignity of work with fair wages. And as I said, this is too much power for any elected body to hold regardless. You have this power.You can lean in and.Hit a green light and support them, which I hope you do now and every night that the possibility of equity and equality is in your hands. Thank you very much.Good evening. Long Beach City Council. My name is Reyes, Mongolia. I'm a business representative of Teamsters Local 48. We represent hundreds of men and women drivers that are driving the Port of Long Beach and Los Angeles. I'm here to just give a message.The port trucking industry is out of control.Every possible government agency has found drivers to be.Employed and told companies to follow the law.But they keep breaking the law. Workers are also fed up. They just went on strike for 16 times in five years and they won't stop until they get justice. The union represents workers at high road companies at the port.Some example companies are toll shippers. C logix hlt eriko flor weber. But these companies are undercut by all the lawbreaking companies at the port. Law abiding companies can't survive if they have to compete against lawbreaking companies. The union has supported drivers in their fight to end the abuse at the port, like the wage theft and driver misclassification. The union has backed these workers in every single one of the 16 strikes. The union will stand by these workers.And as.Long as.It takes and as many strikes as it takes. Thank you for your leadership time and city council. Thank you.Thank you. Next week.Thank you for letting me be here. Council members. My name is Bruce Jefferson. I work at California Courage. I'm a warehouse worker. We will. House workers. Back to truck drivers. They're in California College. You know, I just recently bought a company.But this company in June had just I myself, along with a few more of my coworkers from the warehouse, have filed racial discrimination lawsuit against California courage. Not only that, we talking about the wage theft, the misclassification in unsafe working conditions, such as just recently.Within the past two years, a man passed out in 110 degrees inside a container, shipping container now. And we were told, get back to work. Just put a cardboard box over it. These are some of the laws that this company is breaking.They also broke the law by. Dismissing me, terminate me. As a worker there in California, a college, supposedly for my attitude. But the only thing that I was doing was speaking out about the safety net. My coworkers know about the conditions going on in here in the building.This old building has been up since World War two. Yeah, the company may have put some work in up there, but you had bathrooms up there, still got peepholes in them. You also have rodents running around where we get water.There's not even a cooling off stage. And this is just some of the things that me and my fellow coworkers go through. Even though I was wrongly terminated. I've been on strike seven times and I'm still. Given my time to support my workers up there, even though I'm no longer working there.Thank you for your time.Thank you, sir. Matchmaker.Good afternoon, City Council. My name is Tracy Ellis and I am a Long Beach resident. I also work the harbor. I'm one of the very fortunate ones to have a job that happens to be a Teamster slot. And our company that I work for is one of the fair employers that are.Working out of the port of Long Beach. I can't express to you enough, you know, my experience of working in the harbor. I've been working out of the harbor in trucks since 2001. And. It's hard for me to explain how my family and I have suffered.You know? Yeah, I'm growing old, but, you know.Um.You know, having to pay a truck note on top of the insurance, the fuel, uh, and everything else that goes along with it and raise a family is one of the worst experience that I can, you know, really imagine upon anybody.But yet we show up every day. And still go to work. You know, there are a lot of jobs in this area. You know, being from here, I'm sure, and you guys being here, there's only a few choices of both industries where work is available for average little people.So, you know, I'm here today to give my voice, to ask you to stand up for us little people. You know, the majority of these companies have a hiring ratio of hiring 10% whites, 10% blacks and 70 to 80% Latinos because they know that they're afraid and won't say much.But the the ways theft that these companies are performing on all of us is ridiculous. There's been a 100%. Excuse my French, but. Every lawsuit that's been put in, let me put it this way, has came back, approved for the workers.So I just suggest, you know, just wake up and know that this movement is moving. And it's moving and it's moving and it's only getting stronger. And thank you. My time's.Up.Thank you so much. Next week. Good afternoon. My name is Randy Williams. I work for the same company, Tracy.People ship Transport Express. Proud Teamster member. But before I became.A Teamster member.I was on the other side. Drive in. You drive from.Both shells, start to finish 18, sometimes 20 hours a day, and you're going way over your hours. The equipment is faulty, but you got to do that to make money. One story I always like to tell is. This one company.Is still there, still working in existence. I got there.Checked the truck out, went to the port, sat there for about.Maybe seven, 8 hours, didn't get my container. When I got back to the yard, they said, Oh, sorry you didn't get your container.But you owe us for gas, for.Fuel, for this and that.So at the end of a working day, I owe them money. And this is going on to this day. And that's why you see a lot of the accidents.Not all, but a lot of the accidents.Are people.Who are overworked.Stressed out, moving too fast, flipping containers because they're trying to get from point A to point.B just to make make.Money. So I already like I.Like approved previously said, I already have a good contract.But I'm out here every strike to support the ones who don't because I've been on that side and I know what it feels like. So that's all I want to say. Thank you.Thank you very much. Next speaker.I'll be translating for him. Okay. When I started this. Good afternoon. Same number as Napoleon. I think when I got done. Try at home. Para La Compania the explore. I drive for expo format that is annual for the last ten years.I don't like it out here thoughtlessly. You know, they've completely put me up a lot. First of all, I want to thank you all for giving me the opportunity speaking here tonight. And after the asanas, you are handling it all and what any knew about this size?Well, in the last ten years that I've been working for Expo, we had done six strikes and it does say, well, I see the material. They came on to protect handle. And ended in the last six strikes we've done.We've been protesting because of policy proposals, because of the abuse, because a lot of wage deaf mal classification misclassification, getting a housing credit that is almost going to make us believes are we're truck owners independent contractors one then the real.Yeah. I'll go. Yeah, I reckon rocinante they'll go more and play. When in reality the government agency, government governmental agencies have proven that we're employees. As a la semana pasada just last week. Two inventories, the perimeter of the ang welder.We were on strike for three days. Our cows are at mala. Normally a parte de la compania could be all because of all the bad things exposed to us. Eating it after Israel got. And we didn't in an end.And this three days a strike. It was a retrial. We have fought but get to Compania and well I've said can be what we're fighting for so that this company can make a change. Apparently their 100 crore salary and to stop stealing our wages there aren't they thought well during the strike and to problematic is America rolemodel material come to your payroll during the strike I had a problem where my truck broke down. Yeah. Yeah. Welcome, owners. Also, the Yassine Central Waha and I being out of work for the last eight days and it was actually no it they knew only warm people the the the narrow anatomy family.I have not had any income in the last eight days to sustain my family. A la compania. I thought that zero zero appointment para reppenhagen in El Camino and the company has refused to help me to repair the truck.It meant I would like it. Cuando Mr. Ohara And what's sad about this is that when they come back to work, men have yet been given compromiser their resolve and the narrow, um, uh. Gay egos and uh may not.But if that. But but l mortadella they'll come in in the event the company does lend me the money to repair the truck.

Nicola who thinks Sarah. But isn't that. Pardon me, but attorney companion and justice be served for me and all my coworkers, which I could ask you. Thank you.Thank you.Good evening, council members. My name is. Excuse me. My name is Jeremy Hoke. Thank you for having me here. I'm a Navy veteran who has worked off and on at California Cartage for about 15 years. I've spent most of my life since leaving.They are working for temp agencies, which is part of the problem. But a whole other story that would take up a whole other evening's worth of discussion. But during the time I've worked at California Cartage, I've seen constant safety violations turning turning their back on needed heat breaks for the workers.The containers used to be located real close together, dangerously close together. But I guess OSHA came along at some point and got them to moving them farther apart. So. Any kind of OSHA violations, safety violation, labor violation. They've kind of been doing this damage control, but very grudgingly and sluggishly, only at the prodding of the Teamsters helpingus, we workers with the help of the Teamsters and Warehouse Workers Resource Center. I've often reflected that if I didn't know about if I didn't work in the warehouse industry myself and didn't know about the violations of my end of the deal, I reflect.I've always hoped that I would have known about the raw deal my brothers in the trucking industry get, because I certainly hope that if I wasn't involved in the warehouse industry, I would know about their plight and be able to help them in some way during that.I've also wondered why the warehouse has remained in in this 1930s era buildings over the years when the when the lease was so nice and cheap for for the occupants. I don't know. It's because the the specter of the railroads moving in, preventing people from saying, well, we're never going to bother to fix this up because thetrains are going to get in anyway. So. So I don't know or if it was everybody pointing their fingers at each other about who the responsibility was. But it seems like with a sweetheart deal like they had, they could have maybe one building at a time, modernize it, because this whole warehouse every year becomes more and moreobsolete compared to the other warehouses that you see springing up in the city that are entirely self enclosed. You don't have outdoor docks where the workers. Where the workers have to work out in the foul weather. But regardless of what kind of building contains, as long it remains as long as a safety and.Labor violations continue, we will continue to strike. And that's about all I have to say this evening. Thank you very much.Thank you, sir.Good afternoon, councilmembers. My name is Jim Danto. I actually belong to two unions. I'm a teamster and also I belong to L.B., the Association of Long Beach Employees. Whether we're maintaining the city or moving freight, please respect labor.It's what keeps things going and keeps things in check. And if you can just please support us with your conscience. Thank you very much.Thank you. Good evening.Everyone. My name is Warrior Mayorga. I am a truck driver for many, many years in the port, around 30 years working and different company looking for the best. The best life gave it to my my family. I'm here because I am supporting also the SB 402.It's the law. Give it the lever to you know, to the to the driver for for the company is to break the law and exploitation for all of us. I am I'm here. You know, I'm telling you, I participate.And in the past for for many, many strike and different times. And the last the last week we finish and support in one one of the last one because we want to stop, you know, all the the companies continuing breaking the law.And it's about I asking you to to help us as a boat driver, as a family, as a human, you know, to to attend that that big issue we have that the truck driver, you know, because only that the company they make money in and how is possible my my my coworker he say you know they hadto pay for fix the truck and they don't have no money for fix it.And who has the money.All the time? The company coming here they say and they allowed so you know they let the driver has the money is not true. It's about asking you, you know, do something better for the truck driver. And otherwise, you know, we continue in fighting.We we continue in supporting to all the driver I am working the and the cheaper transport right now with those union job but I am scared I am scared all that I run more than a thousand companies breaking the law and I lose my job.You know, it's says only the job I have for support my family. Thank you for for the time.Thank you, sir.Hi. Good evening.My name is Jessica Durham. I'm the director of the port's.Project at Lane. And as part of the Our People, our Port Coalition.We work together with our community.And labor partners.And the faith community in solidarity with.Port drivers and warehouse workers, like some of those you heard today. And first off, I just want to thank you for your.Leadership on this issue, especially Councilwoman Gonzalez, for moving forward with the original.Motion brought forward.By Mayor Garcia back in February and conducting a thorough series of hearings and.Taking a really close look at this issue over the past several months.And this vote could not come at a more critical time. You know, as you heard from the workers just last week.Port drivers and.Warehouse workers.Just concluded their 16th strike in just five.Years.And I think the message from the workers is loud and clear that this crisis.Has only grown as the port trucking companies have refused to change their behavior.And the rampant and systemic lawbreaking.Despite the countless rulings by every government agency that is investigating the issues and as you heard from the workers and as I shared in one of the committee hearings. This includes the Department of Labor, the National Labor Relations Board, the Employment Development Department.The California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement, the Labor Commissioner's Office, Cal OSHA, you name it. Every government agency has looked.At these companies, has found.Violations. And since these companies continue to violate our laws misclassification.Wage theft, retaliation, violations of the health.And safety, as you.Just heard from the.Workers, the only recourse they have is to take to the streets. The picket lines from their unfair labor practice.Strike have spread from the the truck yards.All the way to the port terminals.Causing massive delays and disruptions in cargo flow. And this crisis doesn't just impact.Drivers in our communities.This disrupts port operations and it harms the port's reputation.So the port has the.Clear authority to protect its proprietary interests.From these disruptions.So, again, we thank you for your leadership. You know, we work we look forward to forward motion at the Harbor Commission. And again, thank you.Thank you very much. You guys like to go to pull up comment or you would like to. Councilwoman in Dallas, should you start now?So I want to just first thank everybody that has been with us through these committee meetings. I'll give a quick timeline of what that will look like, what that looked like, as well as what we did here on the full body of the city council.And thank you to everybody who came tonight to speak. I know this is probably the 100th time you've come out, but we really appreciate your voice nonetheless. Thank you. And so as a quick timeline, back in February of this year, the council voted to move forward with request to find solutions that protect the the port of LongBeach has proprietary interests and labor code violations. And just recently and thank you to my fellow committee members and the Harbor and Tidelands Committee Councilmembers Pearce and Pryce. I appreciate their participation and involvement in the three meetings that we had.Two were held in May. One was held this last September. The first two were open forums and hearings. That was the reaction to the February council item that requested hearings on this very issue. The last meeting we held here in the council chambers, and that was to discuss and just deliberate among ourselves and connect with our cityattorney's office. Thank you, Don, for being there. And thank you to.JT.From the city clerk's office for providing a lot of the presentations that you'll see that are embedded in this item. And I urge my colleagues, if you haven't seen the presentations, there's a lot of information in their presentations from various organizations and groups, as well as letters from one in particular, a large retailer Target.So we'll get into that in just a bit. So thank you again to the many stakeholders Lane Teamsters, the California Trucking Association, Employment Development Department, the Harbor Trucking Association, and most importantly, the truck drivers that were affected by this issue and gave firsthand accounts at these various meetings in the reports that they discussed, specifically nationally, that 71%of all freight tonnage moved across the United States in current and is currently done via truck. And we need about 90,000 new truck drivers each year for the next ten years to keep up with demand. However, statewide, we have seen, as has been mentioned, over $46 million in judgments from the Labor Commission of California since 2011.And of course, it's been said that we've had about 16 strikes in over the last five years at our ports with hundreds of thousands of dollars being won by truck drivers, and rightly so. We also heard that locally there are about 1900 trucking companies that are registered at the Port of Long Beach, representing 17,000 individual trucks.And during this time, I do want to mention that the state of California was actually examining what it could do to support the trucking industry. And we were we were examining that as well through the city attorney's office.So that is SB 1402, authored by Senator Ricardo Lara and supported by the city of Long Beach. And it basically asks for two things. First, it requires that the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement post on its website the names, the addresses and essential information for any port dredge motor carrier with an unsatisfied final court judgment.That's number one. Number two, it extends. Yeah, we can clap for that. That's fine. It extends a to a customer, which is in this case could be a Home Depot or target. But they share civil, legal and civil liability for all port dredge services obtained after after the date the motor carrier appeared on the list.So that's number two. And due to the Senate bill, we received a letter from Target, as I mentioned, and the letter actually states just to kind of keep it short here. It states and details our commitment to continuous improvement in the industry, as well as using enterprise and industry to benchmark best practices while acknowledging the issues atthe port related to wages. And what I would like to say to is I really think our Port Commissioner Harbor Commission, because I know they took on a lot in that September 26 meeting. So thank you to Noel, our government relations team, the rest of our port team, and Commissioner Tracey Agus, who is here today.She had attended our meetings as well. And I think the actions that, you know, have been taken place and specifically I like to see that we do have a new port productivity committee that will be discussing and engaging stakeholders, which is I'm excited to be a part of that and even to bring more information back to theHarbor and Tidelands Committee as to next steps and evolving this issue. So what I will say overall, with all that said, that was just sort of a snapshot, but we as a city have a duty to effectively compete for cargo, find new ways to gain market share, as well as stay competitive in the global market.And this is truly undermined when labor unrest continues. And I asked my colleagues for support and providing additional insight and information from our city attorney's office on the protection of these proprietary interests, and especially Labor code violations at the Port of Long Beach.So I ask my colleagues to support this. Thank you very much.Thank you. Consolation prize, Pierce.Yes. I want to thank everyone that came out to speak today, as well as everyone that's come out to speak and engage in this issue, not only in the last several months since we've agenda business and Long Beach, but for the last nearly 20 years that we have been tackling this challenge.And I want to, you know, echo that at every single commission meeting, I have made it really clear that while, you know, the issues that are happening with our truck drivers is one that's of great importance to me.The number one issue is our proprietary interest at the port and the fact that this is city land and that ports do have a legal ability and right to make sure that we're competitive, to make sure that we do not end up on the national market as a place of of unrest, of labor disputes that are consistentlydisrupting business and the flow of cargo. I think 16 strikes in five years is I think that sends a strong message. And I'm I don't know the answer, and I don't know that anybody on the council right now could answer.But I think it would be interesting to find out how many labor disputes have happened to this degree at any other port in the nation that might put at risk their competitive edge? Or is it just the L.A. Long Beach port that is facing this unrest?I think that after the last five years, you've really seen that that unrest has increased and so much so into a civil disobedience with arrest this past week with hundreds of people down at the port. So I want to echo and urge support.I know that there's conversations around what labor peace looks like at our port, and I know that there are some legal concerns and questions. And I want to be real clear that we all are on the same page and understand that a labor peace agreement is not an agreement with a union.It is not requiring a business to go into a contractual agreement with a labor union, but rather that it is a it puts it on the company to make sure that there is labor peace, that there is not a conversation around workers going on strike or walking out that's going to disrupt the flow of products in ourport. And so I hope that as we continue the conversation, that we really do dove in and make sure that we talk to many attorneys and that we understand our rights as a port and that we're doing the very best we can to end this disruption at our ports.I think that our staff has done a fantastic job. I've really enjoyed the committee meetings and I know that it takes a lot for workers to come out and speak. And I wish that we hadn't been doing this for the last 20 years, but I know that that there's a lot of progress being made.I want to thank the leadership at the state level. I also want to recognize that there are several companies in our port that would like us to to end the labor disputes. I think that we. Let me see.Let me.Look.We have not only target, as was mentioned, but SSA Marine also supports a labor peace that our port making sure that they can compete at the local level and that we are not disrupting the the move that cargo movements as well.So I look forward to the next steps. I hope that the process is not lengthy and through several months, but that we can kind of come to some conclusion sometime soon. And so I want to thank again the port and the the commission for all of your hard work and urge my colleagues to support this.Thank you.Thank you very much, Councilwoman Rice.Thank you. I want to thank my colleague, Councilwoman Gonzalez and Councilmember Pearce for bringing forth this discussion. And I think the city attorney's office has done an amazing job. So thank you for providing us with the education that we need to be able to look at this.Issue in the context of recent, caselaw and legal trends that are taking place on a national level on this topic. Certainly, this is not an issue that's unique to our port, and certainly it's not an issue that's unique to the industry.Although here in Long Beach, it's it's an area where there is some prevalence. And there is no question, I don't think by anyone who's studied the issue that there has been misclassification taking place. And I think state legislation is going to go a long way in neutralizing and making it a fair environment to work and to compete. And I'm looking forward to that. I do think it's something that has to happen on a statewide level. I do appreciate the city attorney's guidance to us as policymakers. I think they've been very prudent and very clear in outlining the areas where the city has room for implementation or discussion on limitations thereof.And so I appreciate what you have done in terms of the guidance you've provided. It is it's obviously an issue that affects many people. And there are very clear legal limitations in terms of what the city and the port can do.So I appreciate the harbor commission and the port staff taking this issue on and it's been an eye opening experience on many levels. And to see where the the national trends are going in terms of a legal interpretation of employment status has been enlightening on many levels.So I want to thank my colleagues for bringing this forward.Thank you, sir.Thank you very much. I also want to thank the committee for bringing this this forward. I want to thank that the hopefully the actions that we take this evening are moving this issue forward and raising the bar for the the truckers, the workers who are so valued, you know, a fair day's work for a fair day's payis really the American way. And I'll just repeat that. A fair day's work for a fair day's pay is an American way. Whether or not you are represented, employee or not, you should be treated fairly. The truckers in our our ports deserve way wage protections, job security and healthy safety protections, just like any other worker.And I believe that this independent operator model is is a flawed model, particularly in the trucking industry. It's unfair and it leads. And we've heard much testimony here today that leads to abusive practices by by some companies and their their customers, but by extension of SB 1402 now.Our drivers are literally in. These poor drivers are literally driving the economy. There's some crazy number like 40% of our nation's economy comes to our ports. And that is that's a senior significant number. And for these workers not to be sharing in the wealth that they create in this country is just a damn shame.And we need to do more. And I'm not sure that this body has the power to do that. We are going to work within the confines and whatever we can do to do that. I'm sure that there's there's a resolve here among my colleagues to support fairness for for the truckers, port truckers in our in our city. But we've got to work with Sacramento, and we're going to, I think, ultimately need some some federal intervention to to make this this this issue. Right. I want to be realistic, too. The looking at the numbers. I think, you know, we would we would do well to to get to a present, a place where at least 50%or more of those poor truckers are in an employment model. And I think there should be be some some some regulations in place similarly to and I've been thinking about this quite a bit over the last several months, similarly to how we we regulate the construction industry with prevailing wages.I think there needs to be some sort of prevailing wages for for poor truckers as well, too, to ensure that we are being fair and that they are being treated fair. And again, benefiting from from the great wealth that they are creating for for our our country.And they deserve fair compensation. I can't can say that enough. They I'd like to think that this model that we currently have and I've heard this for years, I've been around long enough to to 20 years to to understand, you know, where it went when this this first started with with with.With the labor organizations that have been working to so, so tirelessly over the last 20 years to to get us to a place where these these workers are sharing in the economy as well, and have been on the lines the job actions with these workers.I mean, I'm going to say that I am fully supportive of their efforts to to to actually unionize and become part of the collective bargaining process. That, too, is the American way. And so the objective, when somebody gives up and goes to work every morning, the objective is for them to make money.Right, not to pay the employer to for or for an opportunity to drive a truck and then come back with a deficit. And so, again, I'm glad that this issue is front and center. I hope this issue won't go away until we we get to a place where there is some real justice here.You know, but I will say that this feels a little bit like deja vu, right? Because just a few months ago we were here, we heard the same many of the same testimony. And I'd like to say, like I said, I'd like to think that we are moving in the right direction.Um, but, you know, just in the last few months, I'm not too encouraged by that. So for, for these workers less than solid and let's continue to move it. I like the fact that we'll have a report back on SB 1402.I like the fact that we are instructing our city attorney to to look at creative ways for us to to help regulate labor violations. And then I can't say enough for the Port of Long Beach and their efforts.Thank you for being here. President Garcia, you I know you care about, you know, the the the port and its place in our city. I would just ask that that your or your organization, your agency, our Port Commission, also continue to work with all the stakeholders to make this right as well.Thank you very much.Thank you very much.I yes, I had one comment that I left off, and I did want to highlight, I think, the conversation around the labor piece part. And as I'm reading the memo that we have, we do have labor peace at our airport and our convention center.And I understand that in the memo that we're looking at, that we talk about entering into a third party agreement. And so I would like to ask if it would be possible to have a report back to the Tidelands Committee on the the difference in between why we can have that for these two entities and why not, or what might stand in the way or what challenges we might have at the port.Are you able to answer that now? Yes, absolutely. We can certainly provide you.With that report. But if you'd like the answer now, I can give it to you now. Okay.Basically, at the convention.Center and at.The airport, we have a direct contractual relationship with the concessionaires at the port. We do not have a direct contractual relationship with the trucking companies. So that provides a entirely different setting.There is case.Law that established that when a municipality is essentially acting in the market and has a contractual relationship for services, they have the right and ability to enter into labor peace agreements. So under that law, it works out just fine at the airport, at the convention center.But at the port there is not that relationship. We do not have we do not hire truckers. Others hire truckers who then come in and serve the people who are hiring them. So we do not have that direct relationship with them.And our direct relationship, though, is with just the Marine, with the terminal operators.Right. The people who we have leases with.Mm hmm. Okay. Thank you.Anyone else. You have public comment?Mm hmm.Okay, fine. I have folks over. It's about.Okay.Motion carries.Yes. I'm going to move that item 25.\nSummary:", "answer": "Recommendation to concur in recommendation of the Tidelands and Harbor Committee to direct City Attorney and the Board of Harbor Commissioners explore ways to address the protection of proprietary interests and labor code violations at the Port of Long Beach, and City Manager report back to the City Council on the impacts of new state legislation SB 1402."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nAgenda Item five Capital 119832 relating to floodplains adopting interim regulations consistent with the Federal Emergency Management Agency regulations adopted. Updating excuse me, adopting updated national flood insurance rates map to allow individuals to continue to obtain flood insurance or PHENIX Flood Insurance Program and amending Chapter 25.6.Section 25.0 9.0307 of the code.Thank you, Madam Clerk. I will pass Council Bill 119832. Is there a second second? It's been more than seconded to pass the bill. Councilmember Strauss, you are the prime sponsor of this bill and there are no amendments. So you are recognized in order to address this item.Thank you. Council President. This legislation is federally required by FEMA in order for the city to continue participating in the National Flood Insurance Program. In February, Femail published updated flood insurance rate maps and new flood insurance study for King County.This requires all King County jurisdictions to update their floodplain regulations to comply with the National Flood Insurance Program. This legislation would adopt a few FEMA recommended changes on an interim basis in order to meet the federal deadline of August 19.While Stsci prepares the permanent record regulations, recommendations on permanent regulations are expected within the next six months, as this is an interim measure that is federally required to keep us in compliance with federal regulations. Thank you. Council President.Thank you, Councilmember Strauss, for those remarks. Are there any additional comments on the bill? Councilmember Herbals.Thank you. So I just want to say a few comments because of the 185 properties that are being added with this update. 131 of those properties are in District one. 44 of them are single family properties. Eight are low rise one and two, and the rest are commercial or industrial.Although this legislation does make it possible for people to apply for national flood insurance under the national flood insurance rates, and that those the the the insurance varies from property to property. The average in Washington is about $700 a year.And without being on on the flood map, you can't take advantage of of getting flood insurance. This legislation also requires properties to get flood insurance. We've contacted DCI to find out whether or not there is flood insurance for low income individuals whose property is now deemed to be in the flood flood zone.At this point, there is no such assistance program. And I just want to I just want to flag for the interest in the interest of transparency, the fact that there are a lot of impacts to property owners in District one.And and although there is a benefit from this legislation in that property owners in in in the flood zone on the map can apply for flood insurance, whereas you can't if you're if you're not on the map, the downside is it requires you to apply apply for flood insurance.So I understand that that's a that's a difficult position for some folks. And I'm going to I'm interested in continuing to find out more about whether or not there are options for low income individuals who are responsible for this increased insurance.Thank you.And. Q Councilmember Herbold, are there any other comments or questions on the bill? Seeing and hearing none. I would ask that the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the bill.Lewis.Yes.Morales. Yes. Let's get to. Yes.Peterson Yes.So what?Yes.Strauss.Yes.Purple. Yes. Whereas.Uh. Yeah, I guess.President Gonzalez.I think I think, I guess counts as a yes.

Councilmember Lewis.All right, Madam President, I did just want to publicly recognize and thank Captain Sims on my staff for all the work on that commercial lease legislation.

But I do think it is important to recognize that the staff members on the second floor who are so critical to thelegislative process and assure from central staff work as well. So thank you for indulging that.Thank you for taking a moment to acknowledge staff. Always an important thing to do if we want to see things continue to get done. So appreciate that, Councilmember.

We've seen a lot of reports about how important it is to take care of yourself, be kind, be respectful, and continue to push for change.But to take care of each other and to take care of one another, we don't care that enough.

So I will first move for the adoption of Council Bill 118908. Second. Okay. Do you need to say any words?Official words. Okay.It came.With a do pass.Recommendation.Council bill 118908 would create a revised budget control level and provide funding and position authority to start a new Office of Inspector General for the Public Safety in 2017. This bill adds funding in the amount of $354,300 for the OAG sufficient to support staffing for the remainder of 2017.The bill also moves the CPC into a new vehicle that that is its own office of the CPC separate from the Executive Department.

Next item, Madam Clerk.Item seven Report from Financial Management Recommendation to receive and file the fiscal year 2014 year end budget performance report and increase appropriations in several funds across several departments for various purposes to reflect final expenditures citywide.Thank you. I know, Mr. West, you wanted to make a report on this, and then we have a motion. Well, go ahead and make a report. And then I have Councilwoman Pryce, first mayor, councilmembers.A brief report by our budget manager, Lee Erickson.Good evening, Mayor and City Council. This is the year end performance report for FY 14 for the period ending September 30th. It reports on our performance for the fiscal year and also includes a few technical technical adjustments. Generally, this report is good news.Citywide urine spending came in under budget appropriation, including for the general fund. Also in the general fund, revenues did exceed estimates. Overall, the general fund had a 3.2 million surplus, and this is in addition to the $5.5 million of surpluses which was already set aside for CalPERS stabilization fund.Also, there was a $3.5 million surplus in the Uplands Oil Fund in accordance with City Council policy. The city manager is proposing that 5% of the surplus in both the general fund and uplands be set aside for unfunded liabilities.Other proposals include the establishment of an innovation and efficiency initiatives revolving fund, and if that is approved, the mechanics of that fund will be brought back to the Budget Oversight Committee for review and recommendations. As this idea was generated in part at the BMC in the fall.A variety of other proposed uses are also recommended, including the special election in district for the Bloomberg team match. Setting aside funds to build a two month uplands oil reserve and implementation of the pavement manner management plan. There would be there will be a study session on the pavement management plan scheduled hopefully for some time in March. Lastly, there are three technical adjustments, as I mentioned before this, and they're all offset by revenues. So this concludes the staff report and I'm available for any questions you may have.Thank you. Let me go to Councilwoman Price.I actually want to make a motion in regards to this item, and I want to. Make a have a modification to the proposed. Proposed plan for the use of the expenditures. Would this be an okay time to do that?Yes. Okay. So I would like to reduce the $2 million that we have allocated for innovation and efficiency initiatives. And with that $2 million, I'd like to reduce that $2 million to $400000 to allow some seed money there.Put 500,000 in reserves. Allocate 900,000 for infrastructure to be divided by the nine districts. And allocate $200,000 to the Long Beach Fire Department to invest in their search program.Did you want to? That's the motion, correct? Okay, great. Counts Councilwoman Mongo.I appreciate the additional funding to our reserves. I think that this is a great investment. Also, the next big emergency could be any day. And I think that ensuring that our CERT program is properly funded, we've heard time and time again Council member Urunga and I attended the CERT Citywide event in the in Hartwell Park several monthsago, and the program is in dire need. And I worry that if we don't invest, we might not have what we need to make sure to shelter in place for seven days. My district use recently has undergone several outages and we have realized how completely unprepared our communities are for an upcoming emergency.So I appreciate the emotion as stated. Thank you, Susie. 200,000. The fire department needs 300,000, but we're going to help them with an independent fundraiser to raise the other hundred thousand.Okay. Thank you. That's been the motion to the second next have council member Austin.Thank you. Can you repeat the emotion again and how you wanted to allocate that? We allocate this or we propose to do so.Absolutely. And I hope that the numbers added up, but I'll go again slowly. So $400,000 seed money, which is for the innovation and initiative efficiency initiatives from the 2 million reduced to 400,000, so that there's still some seed money there for staff to have the opportunity to pursue some of those initiatives.Right. 500,000 for to go into reserves so that we've set some money aside, 900,000 to go into infrastructure to be divided by nine, and then 200,000 to go to the fire department to help with their cert program. I do want to point out that with the one time funds that we've received and reallocated, we have been ableto provide a lot of resources for the Long Beach Police Department, and so it would be nice to invest in public safety a bit further and provide some of those additional resources to the fire department. They too have had major impacts to their budget.So this is something that they can do with one time funds. And of course, we all have infrastructure projects that are a major priority in our our districts and not knowing what the future infrastructure, budgets and divide by nine opportunities will be.I think this is a good way to allocate some cost savings that staff has been able to to together generate over the last year.So first of all, I think this is this is welcome news and this is a good problem to have, not a problem at all to have a surplus and extra resources to work with. I am going to be supporting your recommendation for the how to to to to allocate these resources, because I think it's important that wewe do invest in our infrastructure, continue to do so until you have crumbling sidewalks and curbs and we need street repairs and we can never put enough money into infrastructure. That as a matter of fact, I mean, would that work?You know, we had a robust study session on medical marijuana. I would venture to guess that the vast majority of our residents in the city would love to have love us to have a study session on how we're going to fix the infrastructure in this city.And so this extra $900,000 divided by nine well will serve our districts well. And the vast majority of our residents will. The Innovation and Technology Fund we in fiscal year 14 and one time funds we put aside I believe, $200,000 for toward that.This bolsters that that that fund even more by adding an extra 400,000. I agree $2 million might have been a little little lofty in terms of that expectation. But the 400,000 innovation going to that, I will completely support the I do see on this a $200,000.Allocation from uplands for an attorney for labor negotiations. And that's that's questionable because I think we have a great city attorney's office and I know we have individuals who are our subject matter experts on labor negotiations. And so I'm I have some questions about that, that allocation, particularly because I don't think there's a whole lot of moneyon the table for labor negotiations and we're going to give $200,000 to the lawyers say no. I mean, you can pay me ten bucks to say that. I mean, it's it's going to be easy to do. I don't know that that that's that difficult or worth that investment.And and I'm glad to see us. I think overall, this is this is a balanced, balanced document with those corrections. So I will support the the motion on the floor.Okay. Thank you, Councilmember Richardson.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So just a few questions. And so first with this innovation fund. So I see there's 2 million added here. How does this add to the 600,000 that we already discussed?Mr.. Mr.. MODICA Mr.. West, I'm going to turn that.Over to Mr. Modica and Mr..Malik, if you can also address.Let me you know, let me complete the whole question and then we get a whole answer from you. I know we did. 600 K is that represented here? And this is us tidying that up because I know we talked about like the purpose for this fund, like some funds were going to go to that the Bloomberg match. But we also wanted to have a body of dollars as a revolving fund to incentivize departments. Help me understand this.Yes, sir. Mr. Mayor and Councilmember Richardson and members of the council. So what you voted on last week was to authorize us to to enter into an agreement with Bloomberg and to provide up to $1,000,000 with the match.The money that's in front of you tonight is actually those funds that you already said you're going to commit. So we were going to pay for the $1 million match with $400,000 of these funds. Plus, there was going to be a $2 million infrastructure I'm sorry, innovation and efficiency reserve, of which up to 600,000 would be usedto to fund this implementation. And so, as I understand the motion tonight, you know, there isn't any other innovation and technology money out there. We don't have $200,000 set aside. What we would have would be $400,000 with a fund balance and 400,000 of the energy and efficiency, leaving us $200,000 short for our commitment for a Bloomberg InnovationFund, which would have to be funded out of next year's budget.So how would that jeopardize our opportunity to have that Bloomberg grant?Well, the Bloomberg grant, we we will have committed to that. So that will be a commitment. We will just have to identify that fund somewhere else. We have two years to identify the funds so we could either get $200,000 back tonight or we would have to budget that in the next fiscal year and identify those resources tomeet our grant obligations. Okay.So we set aside 400,000 that's represented here. And then the idea was because we would establish this fund 600. I know we had this conversation last week or last council meeting when we talked about the Bloomberg fund, and that's why I noticed these things.So so we would need at least $600,000 in the Innovation Fund in order to do what we attempted to do last week.Yes. If you wanted to fund it this year, yes. You would need 600,000. Correct.Okay. And can you just elaborate on the purpose of the innovation fund?So the Innovation Fund was something that has been talked about in last year's budget but wasn't funded, was talked about by the Budget Oversight Committee and staff, was requested to come back. And the concept is to create a revolving fund.Often in departments. We have innovative ideas. We got a lot of things that need to get funded, but there's not a funding source to front the money in order to implement the savings. And so that was the idea of this fund.Is there a concrete example?Yes, I can give you an example. For example, it could be investing in energy efficiency. We've seen a number of projects where if you put in an h-back system for a two or $300,000, you can save several hundred that or several thousand dollars each year in terms of energy efficiency, water efficiency, irrigation improvements, we're even looking atthings like fiber for revenue, putting in city fiber and seeing if we can and, you know, make money off of putting in city fiber. Those would be some examples.Okay. I think that makes sense. I got to before I move on, I got a question. Councilmember Price, I want to I want to understand how you arrived at the number 400,000 for innovation.Well, and I have to say, I talked with the city manager about this yesterday, and I'm learning some new information tonight because it wasn't as clear to me yesterday. My understanding was the 400,000 that we had already allocated for the Bloomberg grant that was going to be part of three payments over the quarter, not payments, three match. Amounts over a three year period. Correct. And that the $2 million that we had put in this was to encourage staff to come up with innovative and different ways to apply for grant funding, etc. that would help them be more efficient and innovative.And that's why, to me, $2 million for that process at a time when, you know, we have so many other needs, I guess seemed a little bit high. So if if, if, in fact what Mr. Modica said is, is accurate, we may want to and I'd be totally open to if somebody wants to make a friendly.I still got the floor.Okay. I know. So, so just so where I came up with that 400,000 is that that give them some. See I thought that was seed money to encourage staff to apply for different grants. That's what I thought it was.So if we want to make that 600, then we can take, you know, potentially from the reserves and make that 600 and maybe even fully fund the fire department's cert program at 300 and just have less money for reserves.But that's just a thought.Okay. So I think there might need to be some adjustments to this innovation fund, particularly, one, we need to make whole the $600,000 commitment we voted on. And then if we if the idea is to invest another 400,000, then that would need to be a minimum $1,000,000 to make that whole our past commitment.And then what we want to do today. Then I would say this reserve here, which reserve is this out being allocated to. This half million dollar reserve proposal.Well now? Well, it depends on what that amount is, but it would go into the General Reserve.So which reserve would you place? The same as a city manager? Well, we've got a number of reserves.Lia.That's an unfunded liability.Right now we are reserves are actually within the financial policy limits. We do have several of them. So we have an operating reserve. We have an emergency reserve. We have our CalPERS stabilization fund. We have unfunded liabilities. Or we could leave it in the general fund in funds available, and that would also count towards our total reserves. So we so we have a number of reserves that I mean, our obligation, our reserve obligations are healthy. This. So would you we're you saying that you want this to go into pension stabilization fund or General Reserve.So the 500,000 that we currently have as the recommendation by staff, we would just add to that so that we would have whatever, whether it's a million or 700,000 if we decide to.You mean the uplands reserve oil? Flic flood fluctuation, up to 2,000,002 months reserve.Remaining ending funds available.So so that's not a reserve. Those can be allocated tonight. So those aren't.The 500,000 that we would have left over.Yeah. So. So this is not a reserve. So this is allocate we can allocate that tonight. So you're saying that's the funding that you want to place in to the reserve?Now. Leah, can you explain that? Do you understand what I'm trying?Here's where I'm at. I've. I've added up. Hold on. I understand where I'm going. Let me get there. There's $400,000. That was a proposal to innovation. There was $500,000 to a reserve. There was $900,000 to. What is this?Infrastructure. I mean, we've got $200,000 for cert. That's $2 million. Now, that was in lieu of the innovation and efficiency initiatives, $2 million. That means this 500,000 that's at the bottom that we can allocate tonight is still on the table.That's correct. That's not allocated to a reserve.Well, it is it is referred to as a reserve. If I if you're asking me a question and I'm referring to Lia to answer that question, because she just answered, I.See those as unallocated dollars. Yeah. A reserve is something we're specifically intentionally reserving for purpose.I think we're just calling them different things, but thinking about the same the same pot of money. I mean.When I think about when I think about a reserve, we've got our pension stabilization fund, we've got a number of reserves, as Lia mentioned, with different purposes. So I think if we talk about a reserve, we need to be specific.So I would just. Move on from there. So I'm going to I'm going to say that I would like to offer a substitute motion. And before I do that, how do we arrive it like I'm a cert graduate.I went through it with my wife. Support that program. How do we arrive at $200,000 is the number they need.The chief says they need 300,000. And if, in fact, we were willing to move the numbers around a little bit, I think there would be support to fund them at the full 300,000. I think council would like to do that if we can find a way to do that.I get it. So so the issue I have is typically I like to get budget requests from department heads through the city manager in the by agenda so that we have the opportunity to talk with them about this.I haven't heard of any need from for this for cert. I know that we had a conversation a while back about saving this CERT coordinator position, and there was a lot of discussion about that. And what they ultimately decided to do was they found other grant funds to keep that program going.So what was the specific purpose for the 200 or $300,000 that we allocate tonight?Will allow them to fully fund their cert program.Is. Is anyone here from the fire department? I'd like to better understand what that means. My understanding was, I mean, they have one position. A mayor and city council, Rich Brant, deputy chief, actually saw programs under fire prevention.Actually, we don't have any more grant funds. We are funding our CERT coordinator currently out of our budget the best we can. With the recommendation of the city manager. What we're trying to do is move that into a civilian spot where I can get somebody in who can coordinate number one.And number two is we're working with Cal State Long Beach right now and their emergency management program to try and get some interns as well. We have over.400 people on a waiting list. Plus, we have numerous high schools that need to serve programs as well. We just don't.Have the resources to be able to train.Those people at.At.Our current levels.So you want to utilize this, too, so you don't. So the coordinator position that you currently have. You don't have funding so you're making do you use this in relief to could support that position as well as internships to move your program?That's part of it, yes. And then we also have resubmitted a U.S. grant for U.S. grant funding because of the containers that we're going to put in each district that are going to fund our resources and our materials that we need for our people.To respond.In case of those types of emergencies where they can take care of their neighbors for at least 72 hours prior to us getting there. Thank you, Deputy Chief. So the the issue that I take with that is that we don't fund positions with one time dollars and we do through overtime with PD.But this is a slippery slope. If we get into there's a position that was grant funded and we're going to use one times to extend it. Now we're getting into system support. We're calling a program ongoing through one times when that's not necessarily the case.So I think that's an inconsistent fiscal policy that we shouldn't necessarily do that. However, if we had a commitment from the fire department that this is not going to support positions, I think there is a place where we can help support this program without saying this goes to full time positions and FTE within the department.So I'm going to make a substitute motion to make the Innovation Fund at $1 million by taking this $500,000 reserve in place and into placing it into innovation. I'm going to take this cert $200,000 and I'm going to offer 1000 $100,000 to help support that program.And then the remainder remainder which it should be $600,000, which is the $500,000 as unallocated plus the $100,000 we have from CERT. I would ask that we take that and divide that $600,000 by nine, and that would be my motion.Oh, that's in addition to the $900,000 already and into this infrastructure fund. So right. So we're now we're at 1.5 million for infrastructure. We're at we're at 1.5 million for infrastructure. We're at $1 million for innovation, 1.4 million for infrastructure, $1 million for innovation and $100,000 for cert, a total of 2.5 million to be consistent with whatwe have. So that's my motion.Okay. There's been a motion by counsel or is there a second on the motion? There's a second. Councilman Austin, did you want to speak to your second or over speaker's list?No. Okay.Vice Mayor Lowenthal.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I wanted to ask the city manager just a question about the Bloomberg fund, and then I wanted to address the motion. Is is that funding coming through today?Tom.So I'm sorry, could you restate the question? Is the funding coming through today?Yes. What's the status of that funding?Oh, the Bloomberg funding. So, yes, we do have $3 million committed. We are we've got the authority now from council to execute the grant agreement, and we're waiting for the actual grant agreement. Then we'll sign it and then the funds will be available.The $3 million, which is 3 million over over three years.Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that. I was also trying to. Councilmember Richardson, I think your substitute substitute had us overfunded by 400 unless you were looking at the remaining ending funds available. I'm not sure.Yes. So early. Earlier I checked with the city manager about that money and that is available for our purposes tonight if needed.Okay. I appreciate that. Well, I'd like to make a substitute substitute motion and. Take $600,000 for seed money for innovation and technology, 200,000 for the reserve, as Councilmember Price mentioned, 900,000 divided by nine and to fully fund the 300,000 to the CERT program.And Councilmember Richardson, you're correct in that we don't utilize one time dollars for ongoing expenses. I do believe we've done so with gap funding, especially for grant funded programs. And I can and and I take our policy. Initiatives very seriously, our especially your budget policies.And I do believe we should not use one time dollars for ongoing expenses, but I consider this gap funding and I'm comfortable with that. And so that's my substitute substitute motion, which I believe Councilmember Price is what you would articulate it earlier.So I have to make it.Okay. So there's been a motion and a second, and I just want to make sure I understand the motion. Right. I'm going to restate this whole thing and have staff restate it for us so that we're all on the same page.Can we restate the motion? And so that we know that and let's answer the questions that were raised and kind of lay out what vice mayors propose. Please.So, Mr. Mayor, the substitute substitute motion would be to to leave $600,000 in the Innovation and Efficiency Initiatives Fund, which would free up 1.4 million. And that 1.4 million would be allocated 200,000 to the CERT program, 900,000 to divide by nine.I'm sorry. Sorry. Reserves and then 300,000 to the CERT program.Okay. Hold on. Hold on 1/2. So there's only one person who has a floor. So Vice Mayor Lowenthal has the floor. I just have a question, Vice Mayor, if you don't mind, I what I want to make sure, because now I'm a little bit confused, is that the Bloomberg Innovation Fund is as whole as per the grantprocess that we went through last week. And so in the motion that that the vice mayor is making is the Bloomberg Innovation Fund Hall.Yes, we believe we have $1 million, then set aside 600,000 of which would come from the Innovation and Efficiency Fund. And 400,000 is as part of the item in front of you tonight from from ending fund balance for a total of $1 million.Okay.And that's and I'm glad you clarified that, Mr. Mayor. That's why the ending fund balance I don't view as being on the table in that regard, because as part of the Bloomberg are set aside for Bloomberg funding. And so so you articulated it correctly, is that it would leave that intact as my belief as well.Okay, great. And so now I have a motion and a second on that substitute. So I'm going to go to Councilman Mongo and then I'm going to go to the speaker's list.Councilmember Lowenthal I mean. Vice Mayor Lowenthal. So just to clarify, because I know there was some questions about operating reserve versus unfunded liability reserve and the 500,000 that might be the variance right now. 900 for infrastructure. Correct 304 cert.That puts us at 1200 600 for innovation. That puts us at 800, which gets us to the full million. That leaves 700 unallocated of the 2.5 million. So the 700 would be the unfunded liability reserve to get us that to the to 2.5.So we're not going to leave the 500 in the operating reserve. We're going to move it into the unfunded reserve, which is in the first line of the budget list.I'm going to look to Miss Eriksen, because in that calculation, I'm not sure that we we fulfill what Mr. Modica said. We did.Sorry, Madam Vice Mayor, we are fine with the Bloomberg grant. The remaining ending funds available is considered part of our total combined reserves, so it can remain there and there would be 700,000 left there and that would just be part of our total combined reserves.Thank you.So so, Councilmember Lowenthal, would you be open to slightly reducing the reserve and increasing the infrastructure to find the middle ground between the original amendment and the. Substitute amendment. Yes. Okay. Would we be comfortable with 500,000? You wanted to shift 500,000.Okay. Shift 500,000. So that would be 1.4 to infrastructure 600 Innovation 300 ASSERT and the remainder to the unfunded liability reserve. Yes, great.Okay, good. We have a motion on the floor, which I think we all understand. Councilman Price. Okay. Can't remember us. Well, what happened? Council member. Okay. Vice marathoning for you. Did you come back in? Okay. I'm confused. Got some free Ringo.Oh, I really love our discussion and especially the. The addition of infrastructure funds, but I think we should use some street repairs. But what I'm mostly concerned about at this point is I know we're adding these funds to the CERT program and and there were some other programs that we discussed earlier this year, like the Language AccessProgram that isn't addressed here and don't know. We were talking about finding some funds for that and I don't see that here in this budget and I'm not prepared right now to tell you how much it needs, because if I recall correctly, it was about 350,000.We we funded it up to about 225, if memory serves me right. So I would like to see that that program fully funded and take off on that. And also, in terms of the of the state program, we did go to that to that to that training.However, I did not see any kind of preparation for bilingual people on that. There's no there are no there were no speakers in Combi or in Spanish or any other language. So I would encourage the fire department to, uh, to use those additional funds that they're getting tonight to look at finding some translators or training for bilingualfolks in that program, knowing that we have a very diverse community in Long Beach, some who would need the language services available as well. So please look at that as well.Okay. Thank you, Councilmember Richardson.I'm good.Okay. Mr. Modica.Just a clarifying question for Councilmember Mongeau. She was originally talking about putting $200,000 to ending fund balance, but in her last motion said $200,000 to the unfunded liability reserve. Can we get clarification on which one is correct?Mr. MODICA That was actually mine.Oh, excuse me.Vice Mayor Lowenthal, did you want to clarify that or.Your question was too shifted?It appeared that the $200,000 would be the ending fund balance. So that would be left over in our budget as a small amount of $200,000. I also heard that the $200,000 should go to the unfunded liability reserve. Just a clarification on where that 200,000 should go.So I think it would be wise to if we're able to hold it in operations until close of of filing is that.Yes, we would recommend that it would we would have a minimum of that $200,000 and ending fund balance.Okay. Thank you.Thank you.Okay. There's a motion on the floor. Any public comment on the item? Please come forward. Very good. You click as the aggressor. I'm glad the councilman pressed accountable on the price, pulled this off. I had to circle it.Actually, the first thing was more technical. When you have something like this and you can check with the city attorney and work it out with the city clerk. But I don't think this should have ever been said. Recommended to receive and file something like this for sale and receive or adopt.I think would have been a better word. Ordinarily, things that are received on file or not as important decisions. Clearly this is given the dollar amount in the appropriate discussion. But if my understanding is correct, also, this is a work this is based upon based upon the fact that the Mr. Bloomberg is willing to underwrite what somepeople already do and others may, such as the ninth U.S. Circuit Court and also James Comey's organization to underwrite what some people might rightly view as Tammany Hall West. Right. I would suggest holding off until you have the check in hand or the funds in the bank.If for some reason they do not approve it. Because that would mean you would have to come back and do some readjustments. It just doesn't make sense to commit to a project or to say this is what you know, to commit to a project until you had the cold, hard and ready in your hands or in thebank. Thank you.

I'm just curious because I know when this came forward, I had a lot of questions and concerns because one of the programs that we used to have was our cancer buddy program.

And through my work I work with acutely bipoc so queer and trans black indigenous people of color, youth, and we center bipoc youth in all of the work that we do.

Councilmember O'Brien.Thank you. This is what we refer to as the omnibus bill. It comes through the land use committee. Every year, 18 months or so. It's a multiple page document that has a series of clean up pieces of legislation that staff basically accumulates over the course of a year or so.We've had a chance to review this legislation in committee over three different meetings and took public comment on this. At this point, there are three amendments that are on the agenda today to consider. And I want to talk through those in order just to clarify for folks.This omnibus bill is legislation that amends the current law. All three amendments we're talking about today are going to amend the omnibus bill by removing a portion. So these amendments would make the current law stay exactly as it is today.So it's a little confusing because we're amending a bill that amends it to undo it. So the First Amendment, I would like to put forward amendment number one, which I would move and ask for a second. This amendment relates to Wallingford design guidelines.So the omnibus legislation makes changes to the map where Wallingford design design guidelines apply. The Wallingford community had concerns about these changes and had not had a chance to be briefed on it. They raised those concerns in committee.At committee. We asked for an amendment. It wasn't prepared at the last committee meeting, so they brought that after discussion of committee. They brought that amendment to us today. This amendment would remove those map changes so the underlying existing current law would continue to apply.That would give the community time to hear why DPD would like to change that, and those could be considered at a future piece of legislation. I would go ahead and ask for a vote or questions on amendment number one, I guess.Questions or comments on the First Amendment. All in favor of approving amendment number one on the Wallingford design guidelines. Vote I. I oppose vote no. The amendment is adopted. Councilmember Harold, do you want to address amendment number two?Oh, I will. Amendment number two basically asked that Section eight of the omnibus legislation be removed, which would have been consistent then with what the department actually submitted for approval to the committee. Let me give a little background.If you look at the central staff's preparation of the committee discussions, they make it very clear what the purpose of an omnibus bill is. I'll just read from both memos, General. Generally, the omnibus bill corrects typographical errors, corrects cross-references, clarifies existing regulations, and makes other minor amendments identified by DPD in the course of code administration.The Omnibus Omnibus bill is not intended to be a vehicle for addressing significant policy issues. So I think Councilmember Brian and the committee that approved Section eight had some good intentions in mind about how we protect neighborhoods from developers circumventing the system, using what can be called loopholes and that kind of thing.And certainly we are now having discussions where we want to prohibit, discourage and not have that kind of activity. What we do know, though, is in 2016, the HALA Committee will look at design review and the HALA Committee will recommend that the program be streamlined, streamlined to facilitate quicker review.And so, in essence, what I'm asking for is a striking of Section eight, which basically modifies the design review process. I think it's very appropriate had that discussion and Hala actually looks at through the design review process, we may you, I think, fully understand that we will be asking developers, we're going to look for opportunities to streamlinethe design review process in certain circumstances. So basically what I am suggesting is that we remove this and be consistent with what DPD originally planned. Make sure that in the HALA process that we look closely at the design review process and then make sure we come up with our policy recommendations.And again, I started this by saying the purpose of an omnibus bill are pretty much typographical errors and technical clean ups. And I think we have to have more conversation when we start looking at the design review process.So I think a striking section in it would be appropriate.Do you want to move your amendment?So I move my amendment with strikes, section eight. And I asked Councilmember Brown what he gave me, a courtesy second.Courtesy second.And I'll say everything I just said all over again. So what this basically does is.We're not going to allow that.Okay.All right. We have proposed amendment number two design review in front of us. Councilmember Bagshaw, I.Think you have a question actually. This is going to be addressed to the two of you. And help me understand this. My goal is to make sure that neighborhoods have the opportunity to weigh in when we've got development proposed that are on lots that are close.And I agree with what Councilmember Harrell was saying about having a full review, and I'm all in on that. But my understanding of what Councilmember O'Brien is suggesting is that in the interim, that if develop if there's development planned on two adjoining lots, that Councilmember O'Brien's amendment would require design review in the neighborhood before both are givenauthority to proceed. That's the direction that I want to vote. So I'd like some clarification between the two of you.I think your understanding is correct. I mean, it's nothing else. I think you have a correct understanding. You know, when I use the term design review, a full design review is about 18 to 20 month and administrative review is 13 or 14.And the streamline reviews 8 to 9 months. And the OHA is going to look at all the review process and come up with strong recommendations. But you are correct that Councilmember Bryant's amendment addresses the situation you talked about.That's a member.O'BRIEN And so thank you, Councilmember Harrell, for bringing this forward. This amendment is an amendment that the committee put in and added to the bill. It wasn't a deputy's request. I think there's always a fair question to ask of what's appropriate for an omnibus bill or not.My intent in bringing this amendment forward, not the amendment we're discussing today, but the one that was already in the bill that's before us was to really honor the intent of the Council in regards to design review and what size projects should be going through that.Councilmember Harrell is correct in saying that there is an ongoing review of the design review process which will likely see recommendations later this year and legislation sometime in 2016. To Councilmember based on his point, my intent with the legislation is it is is that it would go ahead and bring these changes to date recognizing that sometime nextyear we may modify that when we consider the broader design review package. One just correction. I believe, Councilmember Harrell, that next year this will be taken up probably in the land use committee, not the whole committee. The whole committee will delegate that to the land use committee next year.Any other questions or comments. So we're voting on amendment number two related to design review, which deletes section 23.40 1.00, four point a eight and all in.Sorry.Yeah, I think. I think it's good to discuss this.Oh, I'm sorry.If I could just clarify one thing, Councilmember Gunn. So I will be voting no on this amendment and Councilmember Harrell's amendment to leave the legislation as it was previously amended in committee.Thank you, Councilmember Gordon.I was just going to repeat that, that I would also be voting. You know, it does seem to me that it requires more discussion. It seems to take away a portion of design review. It makes it more difficult for neighborhoods.And I think that this that I would like to vote no on this one.Thank you. Are there any other comments or questions?Councilmember Harrell Yeah, I want to make it crystal clear to that. I think it does warrant more discussion and that's why I am supporting it. And I had a note from central staff that that the holler would be making some rec and a recommendation to pretty much streamline some design review process.I think we all want to protect neighborhoods. I don't think there's any debate, a debate about that. We want to make sure that it's done thoughtful at a time where we're going to try to increase housing. So, again, I don't think it should be put in an omnibus bill.That's really the point. I'm not going to defend the pros and cons of the merits of this legislation. I just think it's a little dangerous to sort of do a one off during an omnibus omnibus legislation. I think that's that's the only point I wanted to make.Thank you. Any other comments or questions? All right. So this is amendment number two to delete Section eight of 23.40 1.00488. All in favor of the amendment vote. I.I. I. I. I.Nice try. All opposed vote.No, no.Sorry Bruce.Seven eight. I didn't I didn't complete.One in favor. Seven opposed. The amendment fails.There's two in.There. Were there. John was also.Oh I'm sorry. Two. Okay. Two in favor, six opposed, same result. All right, amendment number three, Councilmember O'Brien.Thank you. So I will go ahead and move. Amendment number three, relating to citation option. The citation option for noise variance. If I could get a second.Second.All right. So this is an amendment that we did not discuss in committee. So I want to just take a second to explain it in the omnibus legislation as proposed by DPD. Let me say first, the current law for a noise ordinance violation on a construction project gives the APD.The only option is to issue a stop work order. The legislation, as proposed by DPD would allow a separate path where they could also issue a citation. The reason I'm proposing this amendment is concern was raised in public comment over this, and I neglected to actually have a chance to discuss that in the committee.And so, without further discussion, my recommendation at this point would go ahead and remove that language. The DPD had proposed to leave the underlying current law, as is, until there's an opportunity to future time to fully discuss that.\nSummary:", "answer": "AN ORDINANCE relating to land use, zoning, and environmental policy; amending Sections 3.58.070, 3.58.090, 23.22.024, 23.24.020, 23.28.030, 23.34.009, 23.40.060, 23.41.004, 23.41.008, 23.41.010, 23.41.012, 23.42.038, 23.44.010, 23.44.014, 23.44.041, 23.44.051, 23.45.504, 23.45.508, 23.45.510, 23.45.512, 23.45.518, 23.45.526, 23.45.529, 23.45.532, 23.45.536, 23.45.570, 23.46.002, 23.47A.004, 23.47A.012, 23.47A.013, 23.47A.014, 23.47A.016, 23.47A.032, 23.47A.039, 23.48.010, 23.49.008, 23.49.010, 23.49.012, 23.49.013, 23.49.041, 23.49.178, 23.49.242, Map 1I in Chapter 23.49, 23.50.020, 23.53.006, 23.53.015, 23.54.015, 23.54.025, 23.54.030, 23.58A.044, 23.66­.020, 23.67.060, 23.75.140, 23.75.180, 23.76.006, 23.76.012, 23.76.026, 23.76.032, 23.84A.002, 23.84A.008, 23.84A.012, 23.84A.032, 23.84A.038, 23.86.006, 23.86.010, 23.86.012, 23.86.016, 23.88.020, 25.05.164, 25.05.508, 25.05.510, 25.05.610, 25.05.756, 25.05.800, 25.05.920, 25.05.960, 25.06.030, 25.06.050, 25.08.425, 25.08.590, and 25.08.655, and repealing Section 23.40.050 of the Seattle Municipal Code, to correct typographical erro"}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nYes, Mr. President. I move the council bill 2018 0171 to be placed upon final consideration and do pass.Sorry. Just looking at the.List up here.We say.Can I get a second on the screen? Thank you. It has been moved and seconded. The public hearing for Constable 171 is open. May we have the staff report?Thank you. Scott Robinson with Community Planning and Development. This is a request to rezone 40 4001 Josephine Street from e t u v to urh3. A property is located in Council District nine in the Elyria, Swansea neighborhood. It is at the corner of 44th Avenue and Josephine Street.Property is about 11,000 square feet and is currently vacant. Request is to rezone from A2, which is urban edge neighborhood context to unit zoning with a 4500 square foot minimum lot size to you are h3a which is urban neighborhood context rowhouse zoning with a three storey maximum height and A indicates that additional building forms are allowed, includingthe small apartment building for on certain corner lots such as this one. The applicant is requesting this rezoning to allow for the construction of such a small apartment building. The surrounding zoning is E2 B to the north, south and east, and then high A to the west, which is late industrial zoning.The surrounding land uses are a mix of single unit two unit and multi-unit residential. Again to the north. South and east. And industrial. To the west. And you can see the subject property is the top left picture. And then some of the surrounding property, the industrial property just to the west is the bottom left and then thevariety of of residential types in the other photos. This went to planning board on February 7th. I received a unanimous recommendation of approval. There was no public comment at that meeting. I went to the Land Use Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on March 6th, and we received no other public comment on this application.As you know, in order to approve a rezoning, the city must find that these five criteria have been met. The first criterion is consistency with adopted plans. There are three plans that apply to this property, the first being comprehensive plan 2000 has described in the staff report.Staff's found that the proposed rezoning is consistent with these four strategies from campaign 2000 relating to infill development, brownfield development and providing a variety of housing options. The second plan is Blueprint Denver. From 2000 to Blueprint, Denver designates this property as single family duplex, which calls for a mixture of housing types single family duplex, townhouse and smallapartment consistent with what would be allowed under the new RH three zoning. Property is also designated as an area of stability, which calls for maintaining the existing character while accommodating new development, which is consistent with the proposed rezoning.Josephine Street is an industrial arterial. The arterial classification is consistent with the somewhat higher intensity proposed for the site. The properties in this area are not actually industrial, so the industrial designation, that sense does not have that much bearing on it.And 44th Avenue is a non-designated local intended for supplying local access. The third plan is the Elyria and Swansea and Neighborhoods plan from 2015. This plan again designates the property as single family duplex, which, similar to Blueprint. Denver, calls for moderately dense housing areas and a mix of housing types, single family duplex townhouses and small apartment buildings. Again consistent with the proposed you are age three. Zoning property is also designated a traditional residential area which again calls for this mix of housing types, single family duplexes and small apartment buildings. Again, consistent with the proposed zoning, the plan recommends a maximum height of two and a half storeys, which is slightly lower than what the proposedzoning would allow at three stories. However, there's not a zoned district that really meets all of the requirements of the plan. Plan calls for urban neighborhood context, calls for this mix of housing types and a two and a half storey maximum height.There's no zoning district that meets all three of those. So this zoned district, while slightly exceeding the height, the real difference is about three feet, 35 feet for two and a half storeys versus the maximum height of 38 feet for the apartment form.In the proposed you RH three. So staff believes that the proposed request is consistent with the recommendations of the Elyria, Swansea and Swansea Neighborhoods Plan and finds the first criterion met. The second criterion is uniformity of district regulations.The proposed rezoning would result in the uniform application of the new RH three zone district. The third criterion is to further the public health, safety and general welfare of the city. Staff finds that the proposed rezoning would do so by implementing the city's adopted plans and facilitating the redevelopment of a vacant parcel.The fourth criterion is justifying circumstances. Staff finds that the proposed rezoning is justified by the changed and changing conditions in the area. There's been a significant amount of change still going on in the Elyria, Swansea neighborhood with the redevelopment of the the stock show site, the addition of the RTD line and other significant other changes in thearea that have increased the need for housing in the area and justified this rezoning to allow additional housing development. And the fifth criterion is consistency with neighborhood context, zoned district purpose and intent. The proposed rezoning would allow developments consistent with the urban neighborhood context and the purpose and intent of the new RH three AIDS on district.Therefore, staff finds that all five criteria are met and recommends approval and be happy to answer any questions.Thank you very much. We have three individuals signed up to speak this evening. When I call you up, please come up to the podium. First up, Casino Williams.So I'm not seeing a Williams applicant.

Kathleen Flynn.Thanks, President. Scott, could you the townhouse form allows apartments as well, three up to three stories.In the townhouse form. The units have to be side by side. They do and have to each have their own entrance. So it'd be the apartment for them to build an actual apartment building. And the townhouse form is limited to two and a half storeys and 35 feet in the proposal or three.But this is a corner lot, right? Correct. And in the in the code, it says a part one. You RH three apartments are allowed up to three stories on certain corner lots, correct?Yes. Yes. So an apartment could be built on this property in the apartment building form.Okay.Yes.All right.

Ocean carries.Thank you. Let's go ahead and read item 16, please.Communication from Councilwoman Zendejas, Councilmember Pierce, Councilman Austin. Recommendation to request the city attorney to draft an urgency ordinance for review at the February 18th, 2020 City Council meeting to address the substantial remodel loophole in the Tenant Protection Act.There's a motion in a second councilman's in the house.Yes. Amna, go ahead. And one of the reasons why I did this motion is because I've been getting a lot of a lot of residents coming to the first District with with eviction notices and fearful that they're being evicted unfairly in the interests of trying to keep things balanced and making sure that everybody is protected under theloophole of the 1482. I decided to really bring this item so that, you know, recommending the city staff to draft an ordinance. Okay. So I'm going to go ahead and reiterate right here what I have. The Tenant Protection Act also called the 1482, which passed in California and legislator last year and went into effect on January 1st, includes a key provision that protects renters from no fault evictions. Essentially, in most cases, a landlord must demonstrate a breach of the terms or lease by the tenant in order to evict them. Just a case in which a no fault evictions are still allowed under the law is in the owners discretion described to significantly remodel the unitsin the case they are evicted the current tenant to it, you know, in order to ask the tenant to leave the tenant protection. AP 1482 states that the remodel must be significant enough to require construction permits, but it doesn't require the permits actually to be pooled or for the landlord to describe the nature of the remodels.The exact language should be the replacement of of substantial modifications of any, any structural electronico, electronic plumbing or mechanical system that requires a permit from a government agency or. Abate. Hazardous materials, including lead based paint, mold or asbestos, is in accordance with the applicant applicable federal, state and local laws that cannot be reasonably accomplished in a safemanner with the tenant in place. And that requires the tenant to vacate the resident's real property for for at least 30 days. Cosmetic improvements alone, including painting, decorating and minor repairs or other work that can be performed safely without having the tenant leave.The proper gym or vacate the property do not qualify for substantial rehabilitation. The item should required landlords obtain the permit. To construction prior to posting the notice to vacate and include those notices in the nature of the remodeling being done and copy of the permit when presented to the tenant.This does not change the law or policy and it's the rent control in any way, shape or form. All that it does is that it clarifies the existing law and helping bring landlords into compliance with the with the ordinance or with the law by asking them to demonstrate the legal requirements for significantly remodeling before tenants received noticeto vacate. Thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman. Customer Pierce. Do you want to do public comment or do you want to go ahead and make comments first?We can do public comment first.And then we'll come back. You can come on our behalf.I'll comment. Now, I'm going to be brief. I think that this is a, you know, a great item that doesn't touch with the state laws already put into place. It makes sense that before we uproot families, before children are taken out of their schools and have to move neighborhoods, that we are making sure that the landlords dotheir part first, which is taking out that permit first. I think I want to thank the councilmember for leading on her first housing item, and I look forward to hearing from our community members and I hope everybody will support this.Thank you.Okay. Thank you very much. I do have a list of speakers. So we have over ten speakers who will be going down in 90 seconds. And we'll start I'm going to call the first. If you can, please come forward and line up as I call your name, please.So the first five speakers in this order are Hall Stewart, Gretchen Swanson, Hilda Delgado, Katie Douma and Jordan Winn, Hala Stewart, Gretchen Swanson. Hill of the Gotto Katie DOMA or Kate DOMA. Jordan. Jordan Wynn, please. Alice, please.Good Mayor and council. I am speaking in favor of passing this. To close this loophole.Because, by the way.I'm a homeowner here in Long Beach. I'm not a cat. But I believe that justice has to be for all of us, not for part of us, and not just for landlords or not just for tenants. And this closing this loophole will provide the city with a situation where it can hold its head high and sell.So, yes, we are trying to provide justice and equality for tenants in a way that allows them to develop their families, to be part of our community and feel proud of that. So please do pass this and let's close this loophole and make it better for everyone.Thank you very much.Thank you very much. Speaker, please.Good evening. I'm Gretchen Swanson in Rose Park, area of District two. First, I want to thank Councilmember Santos for this leadership. Had you not done this, we wouldn't be able to understand the ramifications of a tiny loophole. The loophole has legal implications, loopholes.We hear about tax loopholes and people sort of shudder. They don't want to be, you know, caught in a loophole, but it allows for discretion that does not follow the spirit of the legislation or the regulation. So we know in January of this year we got greater, better tenant protections around California.Yes, but very quickly, an unforeseen loophole here. So my position is requiring permits that meet the standard of substantial remodeling is needed. I, for one, do not want to see landlords prevented from doing this type of remodeling. We have many properties in the city that need substantial remodeling and have for years.This simple and single correction protects both the tenants and the landlords for secure and safe housing. We need to close the loophole and protect our tenant community in Long Beach.Thank you.Thank you, Nick. Speaker, please.Good evening. My name is Helder. Then I'm the district director for Senator Lena Gonzalez, and I am reading this letter on her behalf. Dear Mayor Garcia and council members are right in support of Item 16 tenant protection substantial remodel loophole on the Long Beach City Council agenda for today.It is critical that the city does everything it can to ensure tenants are not wrongfully displaced. Last year, I was proud to vote in support of the California Tenant Protection Act of 2019 to provide a statewide rent cap and just cause eviction protections.Due to the timing of implementation, many cities, including Long Beach, pass emergency ordinances to prevent displacement of current tenants before the law went into effect on January 1st, 2020. Now, many tenants have received notices to vacate properties for what land owners consider substantial remodels without a sincere effort to perform those improvements.The original intent of the law was to provide tenant protections and prevent unwarranted evictions, yet it had it. Yet it does not clearly define the conditions under which property owners can require tenants to vacate for a remodel. Council Item 16 will help clarified what counts as a substantial remodel so our constituents are not wrongfully evicted.Thank you very much.Next week at this.Good evening.You have all heard from me in a variety of ways, and I just wanted to reiterate and thank you.To.Those of you who put this forward. It was great work getting it together and. In counter measure to the discussions that we've heard from property owners, not yet tonight, but in the newspaper, they said they don't know the extent of the work that needs to be done until the tenant moves out.Well, according to the law, they have to know what they want to do in order for the eviction to apply. So if they're arguing they don't know what work needs to be done, then they don't have grounds for the eviction according to the state law.And that is the most basic concept. So this measure will ensure that they have put that into place, that they have a plan, that they know what they need to do before they can send out a notice to evict.Now, you also know that I think this is a great first step. It's a Band-Aid on the bleeding, but that stricter measures would be even better. So I would love to see this pass, and we'd love to discuss what more can be done in the future.Thank you.Thank you. Let's hear from you. And before Jordan speaks, I'm going to call the next five speakers. Sandra Tommasini said I can fee Ankie Zwirner Curtis, Max Norris and Daniel Sherwood. Please come forward. Sandra Tommasini said, I can see an orchestra under Curtis, Max Norris and Daniel Sherwood.I apologize if I if I got any of those names wrong, please come forward in that order.Sure. Hi there. Jordan Wynn, District two resident. I stand in support of item 16 and I want to thank council members S.A. Pierce and Austin, who is not here for bringing this item forward today. It's very important and quick and easy fix for this ordinance.The fix for this ordinance is very modest. It simply clarifies the process. I want to make it clear that it doesn't add any additional burdens or restrictions on landlords, and it should actually help landlords avoid issuing 60 day notices that violate state law and the cost that they would have to incur in doing so, having to defendunjust evictions, reissue notices, etc.. I want to thank the Council for protecting tenants in the winter and keeping tenants home for the holidays by passing an eviction moratorium. Unfortunately, those same tenants are facing this loophole. They are facing these unjust evictions, unfortunately, through the guise of substantial rehab that does not have any papers pulled and does nothave any sort of evidence that it will take place. So we ask for this common sense reform and that this loophole be filled. Thank you so much.Thank you very much.Speaker eight Thanks for hearing me. I'm Sandor Tommasini and I am currently being evicted under this substantial renovations clause. I've been gathering evidence to see what can apply in my case, and I realize that the only recourse I have is to, after the fact, gather evidence that substantial renovations may not have taken place and then sue theowner or property management in civil court. Well, that seems like a ridiculous way to enforce the law. So going forward, it would be much better if these landlords have to provide evidence by telling city permits, providing architectural plans and so forth before they can evict people, which shows that they are actually following the letter of the lawand doing the substantial renovations that they say instead of the cosmetic renovations that they, by observation, seem to be doing. So if you can just put that into law, then we are all protected and do not have to depend on suing these people later, which is pointless because at that point I've already lost my apartment and allof that. So thank you for having me. Thank you. To those of you who have put this measure forward and look forward to this being put into law. Thank you.Thank you so much. Next week, at least.And my name is Angus Warner, and I'm a resident at the same houses as the speakers before me. And I completely agree with everybody. Sad. And as you can tell from my accent, I'm not from here. I moved from Germany being married to a history professor at Cal State.Long Beach was there for 30 years now. And I love being in Long Beach moving here to Germany. But we got the 60 days notice. We got kicked out of our apartment. We had to find a new place even though we made a home, which was for me, Long Beach, the new.Home.Away from.Home.And it was a shock for us. And I said, How can that be as a German? As a German, I would said, there should be some law to protect it. You cannot kick it out within 60 days. I mean, we are two double incomes, no kids.So for us it's okay. We are sitting on boxes and are moving. The end of the week. We found a new place, a nice place. But what about all the other people? It's in the house, in the neighborhoods who don't have that, who don't have double incomes, no kids, and $2,000 for a one or two bedroom apartment. Living in Long Beach is not affordable anymore. Thank you. Maybe I'll move back to Berlin.Okay. So thank you very much. Next is Mr. Norris. Before. Before Mr. Norris speaks. If I can have Daniel Sherwood, Dennis Baltimore. Baltimore. He said after Rosa, Joshua Christian and Alec Forrest, please come up. So it'll be Max Norris, Daniel Sherwood, Dennis Baltimore, he says, and also Joshua Christian and Alex for us.Please line up.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you, counsel. I was happy to see Ms.. And Diaz championing this. I'm a District one resident, and it's encouraging considering what we've seen so far.As an attorney by trade, I know that loopholes are often exploited by the bad people in our society, and I do mean bad people. And in doing this, we need to close this loophole.We need a solid definition for what this work is and a burden of proof to be carried by the developer for that. Otherwise, we'll see continued abuse of this. This is a story that happened in San Francisco where I was displaced from years ago.The loopholes in what were thought to be strong laws in San Francisco, much stronger than we have here, have been exploited to the nth degree. And now we have a city in San Francisco where you have to make over $120,000 to afford anything.And it's untenable and it's coming to Long Beach. And you all have been very complacent about it, and I'm very disappointed. But thank you, Mr. Diaz, and I hope to see more from you like this.Thank you next week for please. Good evening. Council members Robert Garcia. I'm Dan Sherwood from the second district and. I've lived in this beautiful city for 36 years, and I've I've been part of the community ministry outreaches and this and that.And I've been in my home for 26 years. This one's been in her home for 28, and we have three back here, all who have been threatened to be evicted because of this new ordinance or loophole that is once again rearing its ugly head.It's only my opinion, but this is such an amazing city and this whole move is just a black smear mark across Long Beach. You know, we have an amazing city here. We're so diverse in so many different areas.And, you know, like the speaker said before me, we don't all make $140,000 a year. And many of us are very happy in our homes. We've we've made our homes where they are. And I look across the pool at the Obispo Building and this new loophole, and I've got six neighbors that I've known for 15 years, andthey're all empty windows. We share a pool. I've got three from my building in Coronado who have already been evicted and moved out. This is unjust eviction, you know, we're good citizens. We're community. We hold each other up and we care about each other.And we want to continue to live in this beautiful city. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.So much. Next speaker.Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Members of the council. My name is Joshua Christian. I am the Legal Aid Eviction defense attorney for the city of Long Beach. A notice stating scope, timeline and proof of permits will provide clarity and prevent unnecessary eviction lawsuits.The purpose of these notices is not just to tell tenants to move. It's to assure them that their landlord has respected their rights. The two words substantial remodel. Don't give them confidence that that is the case and they can't verify that it's the case.So they can only stand their ground by going to court. For a landlord acting legally, more information encourages tenants to move by showing them the law has been followed. More information helps tenants evaluate the situation and keeps everyone from playing a game of legal chicken.No one wants to go to court. For most landlords who are acting in good faith, all they'll need to do under this ordinance is give an explanation to their tenants of why those tenants need to go. For the few bad actors, this will stop fraudulent notices at their source.Ultimately, for those few tenants who do have to go to court, it will make sure that they have clear legal rights that need protecting. Thank you very much for me and for my clients for hearing this item tonight.Thank you very much. Next week, a piece.Clearly, too. My name is Dennis Baltimore, and I live in Long Beach, California. Over the past couple of years, I've been a victim of displacement rate increases. I'll just I'll just evictions and landlord intimidation has often left me out on the streets.I'm sick and tired of excuses. Being a formerly incarcerated black man is, for me, culturally a black man. I often find it hard for me to get a job. Many others have experienced similar situations as myself, and I ask you to please fix this loophole.This loophole is making us go in circles. We aren't making any progress with this loop loophole in place. Again, I ask you to fix this loophole so we can have a better system to where the we, the tenants are accounted for.Please. But I beg you. We are leaders. Thank you.Thank you, sir. Thanks for Chris's.Hello. Good afternoon. My name is says I am a resident of the First District and a member of Best Art Center of Long Beach. I came here back in December letting you know that my family was facing displacement due to rehab.However, through the help of housing language, we found out that the property owner never got the permit to make repairs. Please support us and. Passing this loophole faces strong. Help us in the strongest form possible. Thank you. Thank you.And before our next speaker, I'm going to call the next five people up forward and that'll be Alex Flores, Malcolm Bennett, Chris Keebler, Cynthia macias and Jonathan Gibson. So if I can have Alex Flores, Malcolm Bennett, Chris Keebler, Cynthia macias and Jonathan Gibson, please line up.That'd be great. Thank you.Yes. Good evening, Mayor and City Council. My name is Alex Flores. I'm a housing attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation here in Long Beach.I'm sorry, Alex, before you, this is Dennis Baltimore. Go speak. That was Dennis. Okay, then. Great. Mr. Barr. Sorry. Start over. Can we start? We start his time, please. Thank you.Thank you. What I wanted to point out tonight was that what's being presented today is a compromise and a modest ask, considering what different cities around the county are doing. What we are asking for is a fix that is locally appropriate for Long Beach and it's cheap for the city and the landlords.We're not asking to create a new department or a new process. We're not asking to create new fines for landlords or new punishments. This would be merely clarify what is a valid notice and what is not. Right now the problem that we are seeing is entire buildings being handed notices which say only two words, substantial remodel.At the same time, we're seeing that landlords, certain landlords are not planning a single permit, are showing no indication of actually doing any remodeling. The problem is that the longer we wait, the more people are going to be evicted.Attaching the permit will be the way to protect tenants and to make sure that both landlords and tenants understand that this is a valid notice. Anything short of that? Asking the landlords to start the process or asking them to file something beforehand is not enough.What tenants need to know the minute they get that notice is Is there a defense? What should I do? And anything short of explaining to them what the plan is and that the permits has already been pulled, that the work is going to be done, will not do.It. Thank you very much, sir. Let's take a piece. Actually Malcolm Bennet is next after Malcolm Bennet is Chris Keebler and Cynthia macias.Guardian American Council. Malcolm Managed Property Owner and property manager and licensed contractor. I'm asking for no vote on this at this time. I believe 1482 just came in. It's only been 40 days. I think we need to allow it to work.A lot of people understand the process in pulling a major rehab permit. It's not something you just just do. And I believe we need to see how this work. And I strongly believe that if a landlord does abuse this and does not permit, I think it would send a strong message out to prosecute a couple of landlordsto do that and not put the burden on the amount of money to pay for a permit for a major renovation on property is quite substantial and quite a bit of money. And then you have to wait 60 days to the tenant, move out and then start work.That's causing a delay. And I personally believe it will dissuade a lot of developers from coming in and rehabbing some of these older houses. So I would ask for a no vote and let's look at 1480 to give it time to work and then come back in if there is abuse.There are certainly facilities and I think to prosecute, which we would strongly support as the housing market, those people that try to take advantage of a loophole and do this. So thank you very much for your time.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Hello. My name is Chris Keebler. I've lived in the city for 20 years. I've worked for Long Beach Unified School District for almost 20 years. I live in the second District. I'm currently in escrow in the ninth District, and I work at Cabrillo High School in the seventh District.I think this is a very important loophole to close. I don't think any developers are shy to come into Long Beach. I think it's also important if we do close this loophole, that it's retroactive to all of those who have received these eviction notices since January.You know, I'm fortunate enough to be able to go into escrow. You know, I have a good job with the Long Beach Unified School District, but I know that it's very hard, even in my circumstance, to own a home in this city.And I think it's even becoming harder for many people to rent in this city. And so I think it's important that we we close this loophole just so that this someone else said it earlier, that we have a city that's tenable for people to to have a take that aren't just, you know, the rich.That's all I have to say. Thank you.Thank you so much. Next week, this.Hello. My name is Cynthia macias. I want to thank you all for bringing this up and most importantly, for actually seeing the loophole that we all have seen. With that being said, I know like.Previously was that it just started it came.In 40 days ago. Unfortunately, I have more than 25 tenants that are getting evicted.So within those 40 days, more than half of those people will be gone. Right, without this. So with that being said.Close the loop. But we.Also want to make.Sure that.Just like this loophole.Was there, another loophole is not found. What do I mean by that? Well, landlords will not be able to put in for a permit and then kick the tenants out. And then once the tenants are out, pull that permit back out.So just want to make sure.That permits are in hand before they kick these tenants out. Thank you very much.Thank you. Next speaker, please. This is Mr. Gibson. Yes. So before Mr. Gibson speaks, I'm going to call the next group of speakers and please line up in this order. Mike Murchison, Domingo Santiago. I can't re the last names is Fred.Oh. Oh, it's Fred. Big Fred. Big Annie. Kimberly Navas. Eduardo Lara. And Karen Harper. So after Jonathan Gibson, we're going to get Mike Murchison to meet us in Chicago for a beginning. Kimberly Navas. Eduardo Lara and Kieran Harper.Good evening. My name is Jonathan Gibson. I'm a District seven resident and an attorney at Legal Aid. We just heard someone say, give this law time, but we already know that the loophole exists and the law isn't working.This is the right time to close that loophole. Legal aid has been flooded with tenants receiving substantial remodel notices when they receive these notices and ask management for more information. They get stonewalled. This puts them in an impossible situation, and many have already discussed do I stay and fight the eviction filed against me and hope that thelandlord doesn't pull the permit before trial? Or do I just leave possibly knowing that the landlord never had any intention of remodeling the place? This ordinance simply asks landlords to be upfront and put their cards on the table regarding the remodeling plans so tenants can make an informed decision.I also want to dispel a myth that there is. We need to know that there's no need to evict tenants before remodeling a unit or pulling permits. That a landlord can already go into a unit, inspect it and see if it needs remodeling.This ordinance would simply give tenants a peace of mind while imposing no additional burdens on landlords. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Mayor and council members. My name is Mike Murchison. I'm here on behalf of the California Apartment Association, the Small Property Owners Alliance and the Apartment Association.So all three of the major groups. Number one, I want to point out to you that unlike the tenant groups that knew about this item, none of these groups I just referenced knew about this. I have until Friday at 11:00.As we all know, supplemental goes in to noon. So I guess from a future action standpoint, it would be very helpful for the other side, the rental property owners, to know about these items in advance so that they have time to try to compromise and come up with a negotiation versus 72 hours, which makes it extremely difficultto communicate to the thousands of rental property owners that are out there. That said, here's a brief solution. Pull the permit, make it a generic permit, have the state, add the city, standardize it to say that it's substantial in nature.Have the landlord then have to post that at the tenant's unit, allowing the landlord to come back in and issue the city day notice after that, but not having to pay the permit fees which are substantial for some of these major renovations.So you're asking Mom and Pop to come in there and pay these guys.Everyone gets a chance to speak, please. So now my.Clock is running. One that's.Ahead.So it gives the landlords an opportunity to go in there without the tenant in there to judge what needs to be done, go back, submit it, and then pay for the substantial permit fees. We're not trying to hide anything.We're just trying to say, give us a moment to digest this and go forward.Hey, guys, guys, I seriously I manage the time he lost few a few seconds because of the interruption. So is letting him finish. Everyone gets a chance to speak. Finish up, Mr. Richardson.Thank you, Mayor. All I'm saying is, is that I'm trying to give you an option to have the rental property owner come in and pull a permit without the fees attached. Thank you. Thank you.Next speaker, please. Which will be Dominga. Santiago.On a memo La Mingus and even Apartamento Cuatro Cuando, though they say have a new apartment there. And then in all honesty, I know there is a review, so call me Familia Esperanza. Marisa is going to use your name, especially not as if you must know that because you know they are local.But the liberals in this society has seen information that they endorse while the trabajo is in the new Burmese source. Los Angeles. Not the official they see, but Robert. And it shouldn't so nice familiar case that someone. Salvador and this is that the system was closed by measles is then completamente forgotten.No sympathy sympathies, sympathy mender and besotted. But I sorry that nozzle notification the SA logo is. Hi. My name is Porfirio Dela Rosa. I live in for four days apartment E and I lived there for 11 years with my family and I hope to continue to live there so my children can continue to be raised there.Myself and my neighbors have received eviction notices because of substantial repairs without any previous information detailing the type of work that needs to be done or permits. All the renters at the Daisy Building are asking that you pass this.This article. So that the families and continued to live there. Thank you.Thank you very much. Right beginning is the next speaker.Good afternoon. My name is Kim. Really nervous. I am.Really. I'm sorry. It's for the beginning here. Yeah. Yeah, for president.Sorry. Right after him. No problem. Yes. Hi. Good evening. I'm a senior tenant in the first district. And thank you, Mary, for taking the lead on this. And I just want to say, we as advocates have worked really hard to pass the relocation or the relocation ordinance, the moratorium and the TPA.And it just doesn't make sense for it to be undermined by landlords who don't want to pay permit fees. So I urge you to go ahead and close this loophole. Thank you.Thank you very much. And now kindergarten.So I am from District eight. This is my second time speaking, the first being almost two years ago when my family and I were being evicted from our apartment we rented over 20 years ago, I mean, over 20 years for remodeling purposes, before the landlord even knew what was wrong with the units I am now.That was at the time asked Lina Gonzalez for help. But to see that my new councilman Austin is supporting this item really makes me proud to see it. So really proud to now be a resident of District eight.This item won't solve the problem in Long Beach, but it is a step in the right direction and I really hope it's passed to close that loophole. Thank you.Thank you very much, Mr. Latta.Good evening, Mayor. City Council. I want to thank Councilwoman Mary San that has Councilwoman Pierson, Councilman Austin for item 16. I'm here to lend my support. About a month ago, I met with residents from two properties on fourth and Coronado, Fourth and Obispo, and I can share with you the pain that they're going through in terms of, you know, being evicted without necessarily the proper procedures being taking place. This is a step in the right direction. I think the city of Long Beach needs to lead forward to ensure that the Spirit of Tenant Protection Act must be maintained.At the end of the day, the spirit behind this initiative and others like this is affordable housing. We really need to ask ourselves, what city do we want to continue to be? A city that economically is for everyone, or a city in which only those that can afford can continue to live here?So I ask us to wrestle with these questions as we move forward, not only in item 16, but in future agenda items that can preserve the city that we all love, which is a diverse economically, racially and ethnically LGBTQ wise and people from all walks of life.And that's at the heart of this matter. So I thank you for moving this initiative forward.Thank you. Thank you to the widow. Karen, please. So last speaker.Yes, good evening. Good evening. My name is Karen Harper. I'm from the third district and I just wanted to stand up in support of agenda item 16 and to congratulate you all for moving quickly, because when people are losing their homes, it's an emergency and we need action right away.And I think this is.A good.Step in in this loophole. And I also have a poem for.Black History Month to give to each of you. So thank you.Thank you very much. We'll just give it to the clerk and roll with us. Thanks, Ms.. Harper. That concludes public comment. Let me just close public comment. We'll go back. Councilmember Pearson. No, you were the last one. Did you have any other additional comments on your second or.I know you turn it over to public comment or no, you're good. Okay. Next step is Councilwoman Price.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So thank you, everyone, for coming out and for your comments tonight. And thank you to Councilmembers and de Haas, Councilwoman Pierce and Councilman Austin for bringing this item forward. I don't think there's anyone up here who wants to see increased evictions or people being displaced.I do think, though, that there may be an opportunity for a compromise here, having listened to everyone. So I'm going to propose that in just a moment as a friendly amendment with the hope that Councilman Councilwoman Zendejas, would be willing to consider it.I myself talked with Linda Tatum just to understand the process better for when a landlord might need to make or want to make changes, significant changes to their properties. And my understanding is that the first step is that a copy of the plans need to be submitted.The second step is that the person who is intending to make the renovations would then go through the plan check process, and with that would come the requirement that fees be paid for the plan check. Process. Once that process is complete, then it would take 4 to 8 weeks for permits to be issued.And then, of course, there would be fees associated with the building permits. My recommendation or my friendly as a compromise to try to meet the needs of everyone here and meet the spirit of what this legislation intends to effectuate, is that at step two, which is where the planned check and the fees associated with planned checks occurs, that that would be required before an eviction notice would need to be given. So it wouldn't be for the full issuance of the building permits before a notification would have to be made, but rather at the planned check stage when planned check fees have been paid by the property owner.So that's my friendly I don't know, Councilwoman Zendejas, if you want to think about it or if you want to accept it or reject it. But that would be a recommendation that I would have. As a friendly.Thank you, Councilmember Price. I'd really like to hear from everyone first. Thank you.Thank you. Account summary income.Thank you. Actually, we would be here discussing this item about a loophole had there been proper notice, proper communication with tenants. Eviction without a reason really brought brought us to this point and brought us to the understanding that there is something wrong with 1482.In regards to evictions. So, I mean, I'm totally supportive. When I heard this the last week or whatever was brought forward to us before that, there were eviction notices being given based on 1482, 1482. What you need to do is Columbus sorry added ten years.The it immediately came to my mind that we needed to we need to fix this. And I want to thank council members in the House for bringing this forward, because it is a way of addressing this. And and it is a way of being able to help tenants and landlords talk to each other, speak to each otherto find out what's going on in each of those apartment buildings so that the renovations can be done in a timely manner, so that tenants can find other housing in a timely manner or temporary order or whatever needs to be done.But one of the biggest things for me is that when we have. Make evictions just like that. It puts the burden more on us, on the city to address housing, affordable housing and yes locations. And it increases our how our are homeless count and it just creates a bigger problem.So I mean let's let's be real. We want we want to address our homeless issues. We want to address affordable housing, affordable accommodations. And the only way we could get there is by working together, knowing that if we want to improve our buildings, we want to improve the experiences of our tenants, to keep them there, keep themhoused. Let's talk to each other. And I think that this motion here on the floor does exactly that. Thank you.Thank you. Next up is Councilman Mongo.Yes, I think I have an additional question for development services. I appreciate the the work from council and they have evictions are and bad actors are never anywhere we want to protect. I do think we want to make sure though that we know and understand the full scope so we don't get ourselves into another position.Ms.. Tatum Are there any other substantial remodels that could be performed that would not require a permit? I don't know what you could limit. Like what if you're scraping asbestos ceilings? Does that require a permit?No, pretty much. Any time you touch the building or any other systems in the building, it will always require a building permit. And that's for compliance with the uniform bill, the California Building Code.So. If you're not touching the system, but like scraping ceiling. Asbestos like popcorn ceilings that even requires a permit. Or are you saying there's not.Substantial there is nuance to this because, for example, if the ceilings are old, it depends upon when the ceilings were installed. And if it's pre, say, 1960, there is a very good likelihood that there is a substance. And that would require not only building permit but other safety precautions to test it and make sure that the thescraping the ceilings is done properly.And what if you weren't doing a roof replacement, but perhaps a roof repair? Would that also require a permit?Yes. There's very, very little that can be done without issuance of a building permit.Okay. That provides the clarity that I needed. Thank you very much. Luckily, I haven't had to do a lot of those things, so I'm not really aware of that component. Thank you, Councilman Price, for that line of questioning as well.That helps us understand the nuance between the first deposit that a landlord makes and the secondary process. I think that it's also important to recognize that with the exception of bad actors, of course, good landlords don't want to get rid of tenants for longer than is necessary because that's income they're losing as well.And so with the exception of the bad actors, minimizing and limiting that liability is always something that we as a council also want to do to make sure that that future cost is not then burdened on the next tenant.So thank you.Thank you. Vice Mayor Andres.Yes, thank you, Mayor. First of all, I'd like to thank our council people who brought this item forward. And I see this is a very complex issue. And I can see from both lenses that it is very frustrating.And we must do our part to address this housing shortage and constant displacement of tenants. We need to find a middle ground that keeps people in their homes and allow landlords to remodel if they need to. And I do think that the city and we can do better in expediting permits and processes.I don't think I need to talk any longer. As long as we talk to more people being displaced. If this item doesn't go through. So I truly definitely would support the idea.Thank you. Next up is Councilman Supernanny.Thank you. And a question for staff. And we've heard some testimony here that there have been evictions. Do we have any hard data on that that anyone knows of? Are there numbers we can put on this? Since January one.Councilman. So we're not we do not have data since January one. We had data from before. If you recall, one of the provisions in the tenant assistance ordinance that the city initially passed last year, it required landlords that needed to evict tenants for purposes of a substantial rehabilitation that that be reported to the city based upon thatdata. Last year we had approximately and this is very approximately 40 evictions that occurred. However, once that ordinance was rescinded, there was no longer a requirement that evictions for purposes of substantial rehab be reported to the city. So the responses we've heard that anecdotally, but none of those have been reported to the city.Okay. So any evictions directly attributable to the loophole, you don't have data on that at this point?That is correct.Okay. You know, first of all, I'd like to thank the makers of the motion for bringing this forward. But we do have a challenge up here, and that is timing. If you can imagine how long it took to put this together at the assembly level, probably thousands of hours to craft this measure, 1482.And at the end of all that time, they ended up with a loophole. What we're being asked to do tonight is to fast track an ordinance with minimal time and make sure we've done all our due diligence. And there are no unintended consequences of what we do here tonight.That's a major, major challenge. And we would like to have. I personally would like to have more data on exactly what is going on here. So I would like to you.Know, everyone, guys, just please, you know.Mystified me why the audience would want to interrupt someone whose vote you want, but I don't want to, you know, challenge your constitutional right, I guess I guess you have that to shout out during a meeting. But for right now, I'm going to support the friendly amendment.Thank you.Okay. Thank you. Next up is Councilmember Pearce.Thank you. So I'm going to ask staff a couple of clarifying questions. Councilmember Price mentioned to step two staff, can you walk through what the process is and how long that whole process is for everybody in the audience?Sure happy to do that. And this is I would just note that this is pretty broad brushed because every project is different. The extent of the work that's being proposed, it varies in terms of how long it takes to get through the planned check.So what I would the steps of the process are essentially for a landlord or a property owner to come in with plans that outline the nature of the work that they want to do. Staff would review those plans and accept them into plan check.There is an administrative fee for a few. It could vary any way from anywhere from a few hundred dollars to $1,000 for the planned check process to be completed in that process. And I'm going to say roughly because again, it varies depending upon that the extent of the work being done, it could be anywhere from four, sixor even eight weeks. However, the city does offer what we call expedited plan check. And if a property owner wants to pay a a small surcharge, they can expedite the turnaround time of the planned check, and that would reduce it by about 20 to 30% of the time frame.So once you're in plan check and that's completed, you receive a notice from the the city staff that the plan check is complete and you're then able to come in and pay the building permit fees and be completed with that process.Once the the building plan, the permit has been issued, a property owner has up to two years to actually complete the process to final that process. And that approval comes in, I'm going to say nine month increments because once the permit is issued, you have nine months to initiate the work for good, cause that nine months canbe extended an additional nine months up to a two year period.And the comment that was made about allowing landlords in the building, right now landlords are allowed to go into buildings. And I mean, my landlord visits my apartment like every three months. He's like my friend. They're allowed to go in right now and take a look and make sure that nothing needs to have maintenance done correct.That is not necessarily a provision of the building code, but generally a provision under the lease and terms and.With notification three days. And then let me ask. So in that two year period, if they get into the building and they then decide that they need to change their plan, check, they can go back to the city and do that.Yes, as a matter of fact, when it comes in, when we assess the plan, check fees as well as the building permit fees, it's based upon the contractors or the plan designers, their estimation of what the valuation is.So we base those fees on the contractors or the plan preparers estimate of the valuation. But during the plan, review the construction and the inspection process. If those numbers need to be adjusted for additional work that is taken into account and the fees are adjusted accordingly.Okay. Thank you for that. And. I guess I would just also say in the in the conversation, colleagues, that we've had about negotiation and finding a middle. The city decided to try to find some funds and have staff really work to identify funds for people that have been relocated because of substantial rehab.Instead of having that be on the landlords and instead of having a conversation around the city going above and beyond what the state did. So in my mind and the grand conversation, it seems like we've we've had a lot of that negotiation and asking for a permit that might, you know, take six weeks, six weeks to afamily can be a you know, a godsend. How often do we not looking for a place? How often do we see people start a planned check process and then not go through with it?I don't have percentages, but I'd say that it's not uncommon to start a plan check and never completed or we complete the work and they never get. They never respond to the staff comments and it's never finalized. So it's not uncommon, but it's hard to put a number on that.And I think that that's one of the questions that just listening to Councilmember Rice, when I heard her motion, I thought, that's not too terrible. But knowing that people can pull good, can start at the plan check process, but then not complete it, that still leaves a gap.So I thoughtfully want you to just think about the fact that if staff is saying that some people start that process, but don't finish it, we don't want to have people be put out of their homes if in fact that substantial rehab does not happen and then have tenants outside of that building trying to prove what's happenedinside a building now they no longer have access to feels like putting tenants and landlords in a very awkward situation. So those are my comments right now. I see. I'm out of time.Thank you, Councilmember Richardson.Thank you. Just a few questions. And I see the you know, there's one motion on the floor. I just have some questions on that motion. So it.So this is a.Question for the city attorney. The recommendation actually doesn't say very much. So what do you understand the recommendation to mean and how would you approach this item?Thank you for that question. You're stealing my thunder a little bit because I was going to ask for this clarification before you all took a vote. So it's clear everyone knows what you're voting on. I was going to approach it such that, well, first and foremost, what everyone should understand is that in order to make any changesto 1482, local municipalities need to adopt the entirety of section, not the entirety of 1482. But you do need to adopt in the entirety of the just cause provisions and the relocation provisions. So if this passes, the ordinance that is going to come back is going to be a long one because I'm going to cut and pastethe exact provisions of 1482 and then I'm going to add what NB 16 here has asked me to add in. I won't just use the recommendation, but I'll take from the entirety of the narrative. And I think it's pretty clear with two exceptions, which I think I need to put Councilwoman Zendejas and Councilman Pearce on the spota bit for some clarification. Namely, that motion that was originally read was some time ago now. And I want to make clear that in addition to what NBI 16 is requesting, that the motion also would like the ordinance to require that building permits not only be issued in advance of the termination notice, but that they be attachedor otherwise referenced to the termination notice. Is that right? Correct. Okay. And I thought that that's what I heard, what I haven't heard from anybody and which is important is that you're asking me and I and I can do this to temporarily prohibit all no fault notices for substantial remodel until February 18th, which of course assumes thatan ordinance comes back on that date, which I think I can do and that it passes and that makes sense. But prohibit from when I don't think unless I missed it. We don't say when the prohibition starts. And I think it could be February 7th, which is the date on which this notice went public.That's normally the way things work in the rent control arena, or I suppose it could be earlier than that. I don't know what you all were thinking, and I want to make sure that everyone behind the dais knows what they're voting on.Yes.I would prefer from February.From February. Yeah. So we'll do it any, any notice after February 6th issued on February 7th until the effective date of the new ordinance would be null and void. Landlords would have to re comply with the termination notice.That would only be a 11 day period. I think 11 or 12 days. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I don't know if that answered your question entirely.So. So you would approach this. You would grab that section of the state law, make that the local ordinance, and you would grab these two provisions that are in the discussion and include it.That's right. And my intention would be to bring back a red line, to make it simple for the public and the council members to see exactly what changes were made to the first half of 1482, which is Civil Code 1940 6.2.So those those two areas are one. Obtain all necessary permits from all applicable government agencies before serving a notice, and then to include information in the notice to vacate about the type and scope of the work. Okay. I understand that.So next question. So is there a definition either in state law or within this law on what substantial rehabilitation means?There is it's already in 1482, and we're not going to change that definition. At least this is not requesting us to do that. And that is there's a couple of different requirements. Any work so substantial remodeling has to be work that requires a local public agency to issue a permit.Or it can be work where no permit is required but has to do with hazardous materials abatement. Like the asbestos example. In. I don't I don't have that much experience, but I think that would be rare where there would be abatement work that wouldn't require a permit, but the law allows for that.So it has to be one of those two things. Any work that requires a permit or hazardous materials abatement work, and if it's one of those two things, it also has to reasonably require the tenant to vacate and it's going to take 30 or more days.So it has to be something on the inside of the unit. So if you have to pull a permit I mean, do you need a permit for your irrigation?Well, you might, but presumably that would not require a tenant to vacate.Okay. Installing carpet.I don't think you need a permit for curfew.So where's the threshold? Just curious. What's the threshold?I'm not entirely certain. I think that's best for.The threshold as it's defined in the ordinances that work that requires a permit. And so that typically is work on the interior of the unit. And typically it's major work such as repairing the air, the effects systems or any of the other structure of the plumbing systems.So those all require permits.So replacing the age back would be a justified reason to issue a six day notice.Per the way it's defined in the in the code. And but again, I think some reasonableness is required on the on the part of the the property owner.Okay. So I guess the reasonableness that gets spelled out or litigated in court, whether it was reasonable for did you really need this person to vacate to fix the AC or not?That's exactly right. So so substantial remodeling, even if it requires a permit, it's not going to qualify as a reason to evict someone unless that permitted work cannot reasonably be accomplished in a safe manner with the tenant living there.I mean, that's up to some interpretation, but that's the way the law. Okay.So next question. So the conversation on site plan review, is that required on every substantial remodel project?Again when the project plans are brought in to the counter, staff would look at the plans and make a determination as to whether or not they needed to go through that. What I described as the planned check process, because if it's a fairly simple and straightforward improvement, it may not need a planned check.It could potentially be issued over the counter. It really depends upon the extent of the work, the scope of the work being done.Okay. So if it's a substantial remodel and it doesn't require much site planning, much planned check, you come in, it's a pretty straightforward process. Then they would just move straight to a permit.That's correct. There are cases, limited cases, where a permit could be issued over-the-counter if it's not a major rehab, just they change out of the HVAC system, for example.So if it's not immediately issued, how long does it typically take? Once you pay for a permit to receive a permit.Again, what you're paying for initially is the planned check process, and that's the administrative fee for staff to review the plans to determine code compliance. And then after that process complete, that's when you pay for the actual building permit.And the building permit is what authorizes you to essentially begin the work.So that's that second step of paying for the permits and receiving your permits on a four plex counts.And we have to move on to the time and time's up. So. Okay, great. I know we're going back around to a few other folks, so I'm going to just have a couple just really briefly, just this is the staff because this is the way I've understood it.And if I'm incorrect, please correct me. I mean, state law currently says new state law that's in place currently says that before you can do a substantial renovation, you have to pull a building permit. Correct?I don't know that that's necessarily in the state law because that's currently a building code requirement. That's kind of a standard.I believe that.You mean in 1482 or just in general? I wasn't clear on your question, but in general, yes, you do. You are required to pull a building permit prior to doing substantial work motivation.That that is correct. Right. Mr. Austin, I just spoke about this as well.And again, I'm just going to say generally, because there are always nuances and circumstances where it.Wasn't that also remind me correctly and I'm not an expert in the law, but I thought that was also referenced in the new bill that also just passed was 92.1482. Yeah. No, 1482 actually says substantial remodel is any work that requires a permit or hazardous abatement work that doesn't require a permit. So it would suggest as though there is something it's possible that there is something that qualifies as substantial rehabilitation under 1482 that doesn't require a permit.I don't know that that's true, but the law reads as such that if someone thought about it, there may be such a thing as substantial rehab that does not require a permit.Okay. I mean, that's not the way that I have heard it interpreted in other discussions. But I think that's what's I think the question. Right. And I think that's what I think is this agenda item is trying to lead to.And so the way I'm understanding what council in discussions is proposing is that before this type of work would happen and there would and there would be eviction notices that the the contractor or the property owner doing the work would pull.The permit, is that correct?That's that's correct.It was to me that what what is being proposed aligns and essentially codifies what is already. The law.Well, it codifies the law in the sense that it's defining what requires the building permit issuance. But the difference is that right now, the the law doesn't require the noticing of the tenant and it doesn't very specifically define the nature of the work.That is a basis for the tenant to be evicted. And that's what this clarifying language proposes to do.Mr.. Mr.. ANTHONY, do you do you feel like I am also getting a sense that you're trying to ensure that what's in front of us, in what's adopted, you're able to to turn into an ordinance. Do you feel that you have enough information about what that about what you need from a definition perspective?I do. Okay. You do. Okay, great. The only other thing I'll add is I support customers and the House's proposal. I will also just add that I think the part that I think is difficult, that I've heard from a lot of folks is it becomes very hard for for folks that are low income, maybe undocumented, may nothave a lot of resources to, after the fact, get civil, go through a civil process where they may not be able to have the resources to go through an additional process. And so I think if if if we're able to assist those.Folks.At the start and to ensure that that property owners are pulling the proper permits to do the work, I don't think I don't find this to be a very an overly burdensome proposal. I think to me it's very common sense that to me it aligns with with the spirit of what the state was trying to do andwhether, you know, folks agreed or not. Agreed. I don't think I think that's the law that's in front of us in the spirit of that law, I believe, aligns with what this proposal is. And so I just want to thank Councilmember and House for bringing this forward.And I think it's a commonsense proposal. I'll turn this over to Councilman Sunday House.Thank you, Mayor, and thank you for your support. Question for the staff. Just for clarification, a unit does not have to be vacant before issuing the permit to the owners. Is that correct?There is no provision in the building code or any local code that requires that a unit be vacant before a permit is issued that is completely at the discretion of the property owner.Okay. Thank you very much for clarifying that just for me. Another thing, I'm going back to Councilmember Supervisor's question about data. I don't have specific data, but I have a long list of people who have already been evicted from their homes right now.And I I'd be more than happy to share with you. But in in the interests of time, just know that yes, we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Just in in my district, district one, we have one, two, three, four, five, six in district two.We also have one in District four and three in District six. So and that's only in the short 30 days that we have. I think that, you know, this what we're asking for right now is really a big compromise.What really breaks my heart is to see how many children are among these numbers then. And again, I'm not looking for an applause. Thank you, but no thank you at this moment. I just want to say that, you know, that's why I'm really concerned about uprooting the children from their homes and also to go back to seeingthat sometimes I'm a renter myself and I don't have the first or second month's rent and a net positive to be able to move in 60 days from where I am. So I'm I if I'm not able to do that, I can understand how it would be a burden for these folks as well.So thank you.Thank you, counselor. Entrepreneur.Thank you. You know, all in all our thank you's, I don't think we mention city staff. Thank you for all your work from development services on this, and especially Rich Anthony. That must have been a very fun weekend for you.So it was an incredible amount of work. And what we're learning here tonight is that and I didn't realize, not just a few minutes ago, is that we'll have a whole new audience here in line. We said we currently do not have.That's correct.And that will basically basically replicate 1482, which we had at one time or a version of that, and then we reject it. So that's back on.And we're doing that specifically because that is a that is a specific requirement of 1482.Understood. Okay. Well, thank you for all your work.You're welcome. Thank you.Thank you. Councilmember consumer appears.I hope that my colleagues don't kill me. But I want to clarify. You had asked the question and Councilmember Zendejas had answered on the day that it's effective and she had clarified February 7th. Is there something preventing us from making it January one?No, but I would I would then limit the language to say it can go back to January one to prohibit all pending pending notices of termination. If any notices of termination have actually been acted upon, a tenant has accepted reload and left.We don't want to undo those.Well, remember, tenants don't get reload for substantial rehab.Under 1482. They do.Okay. Thank you. I didn't want to get confused again, so I. You would just have to change the language.That's right. Is that. But I think I need to hear from them.I understand the move. I would like to make a substitute motion for January one just because for all those that have not been acted upon.We can make a friendly.Also friendly. I'm sorry. A friendly motion.Me? Okay. Got it.A friendly amendment. Councilwoman Zendejas, would you accept that? Yes. Okay. So now we have Councilman Mango.I just want to thank Councilman Zendejas. I know that these items can be contentious. And also a thank you to Councilman Pearce, because I think that one of the things that we as a diocese are trying to do is be collegial and demonstrate the respect for different people's opinions and that.Both praise and scowls towards any council member would not be appreciated. And I really appreciate the class that you brought tonight in bringing forward such an important item. Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember Richardson.Thanks. You know, last thing, you know, I was getting some clarity. It was just really unclear in the motion. But I think where it's going, I think this makes sense. If I think it's if if the attempt is to close a loophole, I think you want to be as simple as possible in closing a loophole so itdoesn't create a loophole. So Councilwoman Sandy has know all the signers. Good work. Councilwoman, your first item and I'm happy to support it.Thank you. Thank you. And that I was I was actually going to close with the just congratulations on your first piece of legislation, councilwoman and Mayor.Just just to clarify.Because I just I got it. Got it. And so, Councilman, today has I know that there was earlier there was a a friendly that was offered up. And I know you have accepted Councilman Pearce's friendly. I'm not sure where the rest of your motion is.Councilman.I think I would like to move forward, as is with the Pierce's family. Thank you.Okay. So the motion is the original motion with the addition of Councilmember Pierce's date change members. Please go ahead and Caspir votes.Motion carries.Thank you. Okay. Thank you. I know we have a we have a full agenda. So if folks are exiting, please, now would be a good time so we can continue on the agenda.

Tracy Huggins, it's good to see you.Good evening, Mr. President. Members of City Council. My name is Tracy Huggins. I am the executive director of the Denver Urban Renewal Authority here this evening to request of City Council your consideration of an amendment to the St Anthony Urban Redevelopment Plan to add the Sloan's BLOCK three project and to create the Sloan's BLOCK three sales taxincrement areas. The scene at the Urban Redevelopment Area was established following City Council approval in July of 2013 and is comprised of approximately 32 acres generally bounded by Stewart Street on the west west Colfax Avenue on the South Perry Street on the East and West 17th Avenue on the North.The majority of the urban redevelopment area was occupied by the Saint Anthony Central Hospital campus prior to its closure. The redevelopment of the former hospital campus is primarily supported by two metropolitan districts, which use additional property taxes levied on the property to finance a variety of infrastructure improvements.Even with the use of metropolitan district financing, there was concern that the key objectives of the redevelopment plans could go unrealized without potential gap financing to support catalytic projects along West 17th Avenue and along West Colfax Avenue. In particular, the Colfax Parcel or BLOCK seven was challenged by difficulty in attracting new neighborhoods, serving retail to a largelyblighted stretch of West Colfax and the anticipated extraordinary cost to support structured parking to meet the urban design objectives of Main Street zoning. The potential gap financing for the common parcel or BLOCK three was driven by a desire to preserve a 1939 structure that requires extraordinary abatement and renovation, including a complete replacement and mechanical systems historically servedby the main hospital. Central Plan. With those concerns in mind. City Council approved the Urban Redevelopment Plan, which encompasses the nine blocks noted in this diagram. Council also approved the creation of a property tax increment area that is coterminous with the metropolitan district boundaries.Any property tax increment generated within the property tax increment area can only be utilized on approved projects. To date, council has approved two projects within the urban redevelopment area. Thus the BLOCK seven West Project, which will be the future home of the Alamo Drafthouse Theater.Miss Hawkins? Yes. Our, uh, you know, illumination has gone there, so if you could tell us the pages that you're on, that'd be helpful.Do you? The pages of.What?Mr. President, of this. So do you see this on your. On your screen?Some of us do. Does everybody have one? This one's on.The back.One. I will not be offended at all if you choose to turn around and look at your monitors instead of facing me.Okay. I think. I think some of us have enough.Yeah. They're not on there.Yeah, we have.Just like you have the slide slides. So I actually. Maybe I can do this. I believe I am on slide four.Okay, great.Do you want to give me a head? Not if you're. If you're with me on slide four, make sure we're synched up.Is that three or four on an hour's, guys? Four. Okay.So far, so good on slide four. Yeah.Okay. Go ahead.All right. All right.So, to date, council has approved two projects within the urban redevelopment area, the Sloan's BLOCK Seven West Project, which will be the future home of the Alamo Drafthouse Theater and the BLOCK seven East Project, which includes the redevelopment of the existing Raleigh Office Building and the construction of new retail along Colfax.Those projects were approved by City Council in January of 2015. The project, being considered this evening through an amendment to the Urban Redevelopment Plan, is the redevelopment of BLOCK three, which is generally bordered by West 17th Avenue, Perry Street, West 16th Avenue and Quitman Street.This launch block three project site covers an entire block within the urban redevelopment area and includes the existing vacant former nurse's dormitory, the Coleman Building and auditorium building. So I'm now on Slide six. So still with me?Yup.All right. So the BLOCK three project would include the following components. Rehabilitation of the 44,000 square foot historic Coleman building, a former nurse's dormitory into multifamily, affordable housing rehabilitation of the auditorium attached to the Coleman building into a 5000 square foot retail and or restaurant space.Construction of a new 2200 square foot single storey retail building. Construction of approximately 25 new market rate townhomes. Construction of a 4300 square foot public plaza, as well as the installation of streets, utilities and public space within the site, as well as storm drainage facilities for block three and adjacent blocks.So I'll touch on each of those components briefly. As far as the affordable housing, as part of the implementation of the previously negotiated affordable housing plan for the Saint Anthony site, the six story Coleman building will be redeveloped to include 49 affordable units.The building amenities will include an onsite leasing office community room with an entertainment area and kitchenette, as well as a fitness center. The building will have 30 reserved surface parking spaces and an additional 15 reserve parking spaces in the existing parking garage that is located on BLOCK five.This slide and I'm now on slide number eight provides a breakdown of the unit mix in the Coleman building. As you can see, of the 49 total units, three will be studios. 37 will be one bedroom, and the remaining nine units will be two bedroom.This slide also provides the expected expected rents for the various types of units, as well as the current income guidelines for persons at 60% of area median income. Or am I? I will note that this project did receive 4% low income housing tax credits through their application to the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority.So the income will be limited to 60% of AM I. On Slide nine, we show the retail, restaurant and Public Plaza components of the project. As I noted previously, it will include new retail, restaurant and public spaces. The renovated Coleman Auditorium building will include 5000 square feet of retail and or restaurant space.There will also be new construction at the corner of West 17th Avenue and Perry Street to provide an additional 2200 square feet of retail and restaurant space, along with a new 4300 square foot public plaza. These uses will be supported by approximately 32 parking spaces on block three.This project will also include for sale housing by virtue of the sale of approximately 25 for sale market rate townhomes. These townhomes will be three and four stories and will will face West 17th Avenue, Quitman Street and West 16th Avenue.Each townhome will have either one or two garage parking for their homeowners. The Urban Redevelopment Plan authorizes Jerry to finance projects within the urban redevelopment area by use of tax increment financing. The plan amendment will authorize the use of property tax increment financing as well as to add the loans.BLOCK three sales tax increment areas. Doris Gaff has done a thorough underwriting of the project and has reviewed the redevelopment budget and performance submitted by the developer and believes there is a financial gap in the project of approximately $6.5 million.This amount is subject to change based on the final pricing of those 4% low income housing tax credits. This financing gap will be addressed by reimbursing eligible costs through sales and property tax increment generated by the redevelopment of the property that is block three as well as amounts from the broader property tax increment area.Following redevelopment, the site is anticipated to generate approximately $120,000 per year in net property tax increment and approximately $95,000 per year in net sales tax increment. This amount of increment being generated from block three alone would not be sufficient to repay the entire $6.5 million financing gap in the project.Therefore, the incremental tax revenues from block three will be supplemented by taking an amount from the property tax that is generated through the development of blocks one, two and four of about $850,000 per year. And those amounts, again in combination will be used to reimburse the developer for those eligible expenses over a period not to exceed 25years. In approving the Saint Anthony Urban Redevelopment Plan, City Council found the Urban Redevelopment Plan to be in conformance with the Denver Comprehensive Plan 2000 and its applicable supplements. Accordingly, any amendment to the Urban Redevelopment Plan must be in conformance with the Urban Redevelopment Plan objectives in order to maintain the continuing conformance with comp plan 2000.The general objectives of the Saint Anthony Urban Redevelopment Plan are to reduce or eliminate blighted conditions and to stimulate the continued growth and development of the urban redevelopment area. The proposed project meets the following objectives of the Saint Anthony Urban Redevelopment Plan to eliminate the present and growing factors which contribute to blight in the urban redevelopment area. To renew and improve the character and environment of the area and its surroundings by preventing or ameliorating economic, physical and environmental deterioration. To encourage residential retail and commercial development and redevelopment that is socially and economically inclusive and from which the urban redevelopment area and its environs can draw economic strength to encourage and protect existing development within andimmediately adjoining the area by creating conditions from which these areas can draw new economic strength to more effectively use under to more effectively use underdeveloped land within the area to encourage land use patterns within the area where pedestrians are safe and welcome to promote a diverse mix of dense housing options to encourage re-use of existing buildings whereappropriate, including adaptive reuse. To promote a diverse, sustainable near neighborhood economy, including mixed use and commercial development opportunities within the urban redevelopment area, and to improve access to healthy transportation options and existing parks. In approving the proposed amendment to the Urban Redevelopment Plan.There are a number of legislative findings that city council must make. Those include the finding that the Sloan's BLOCK three project is located within the Saint Anthony Urban Redevelopment Area and will promote the objectives set forth in the Saint Anthony Urban Redevelopment Plan.Also, finding that a feasible method exists for relocation of displaced individuals and families and business concerns. The project area contains no residences, therefore no individuals or families will be displaced. Additionally, due to the vacancy of the site, no business concerns will be displaced as a result of the project.Asking council to find that written notice of this public hearing has been provided to all property owners, residents and owners of business concerns in the resolution setting this public hearing. City Council requested Dura to undertake this task. Written notice was mailed first class mail to all known property owners, residents and owners of business concerns in the SaintAnthony Urban Redevelopment area. That mailing was undertaken on January 13, 2017, which is at least 30 days prior to this public hearing. Council must find that no more than 120 days have passed since the first public hearing before City Council on this plan amendment.Tonight is the first public hearing before Council on this plan amendment. The statute also requires that two years must elapse before council consider an urban redevelopment plan amendment if they previously failed to approve an Urban Redevelopment Plan amendment for this project.This is the first consideration by City Council of this planned amendment for this project. Also, the plan amendment contains no property that was included in a previously submitted plan amendment that was not approved by City Council. As such, the requirement to wait at least 24 months since any prior public hearing is inapplicable.Must find that the plan amendment is in conformance with the Denver Comprehensive Plan. To that end, on January 18th, 2017, the Denver Planning Board, unanimously, with one abstention, found that the proposed amendment to the St Anthony Urban Redevelopment Plan conforms to the Denver Comprehensive Plan and applicable supplements.And a letter to the. To this effect has been submitted as part of the record of this hearing and is requesting that city council concur with the planning boards finding. The St Anthony Urban Redevelopment Plan is amended by the proposed amendment will afford maximum opportunity consistent with the sound needs of Denver as a whole for the rehabilitationor redevelopment of the area by private enterprise. The development team of Trail Brake Partners and Copland Company are the developers and private development entities who intend to undertake the redevelopment project. Council must find that the city and county of Denver can adequately, adequately finance and agreements are in place to finance any additional city and county of Denverinfrastructure and services required to serve development within the Sloan's BLOCK three project area for the period during which the incremental sales taxes are paid to the authority. The plan allows for cooperative agreements between the city and borough to address additional infrastructure requirements and city services should they arise.The Urban Renewal Authority has notified Council must find that the Urban Renewal Authority has notified the boards of each other taxing entity whose incremental property tax revenue would be allocated under the Urban Redevelopment Plan, and that an agreement has been negotiated governing the sharing of incremental property tax revenue.This amendment to the Saint Anthony Urban Redevelopment Plan invoke certain new statutory requirements. Recall that the original plan was approved in 2013, and now that we are coming forward in 2017, there are provisions of House Bill 15 1348 governing urban renewal activities that now require that City Council before City Council can approve a new urban renewal plan, or in this case, an amendment to an existing plan. You must find that an agreement has been entered into between Doura and the affected taxing districts in regard to the allocation of property tax increment to the project. There are three other property taxing districts.Those being Denver Public Schools. The Urban Drainage and Flood Control District. And the South Sloan's metropolitan districts that I mentioned at the beginning of this presentation. To satisfy these new statutory requirements. Dura has negotiated agreements with these three taxing entities.First, I'll speak to the school funding agreements between Durham and DPS in recognition of the proposed number of residential units expected to be delivered across the entire Saint Anthony Urban redevelopment area, including those blocks which do not have any direct involvement.During negotiating an agreement with Denver Public Schools, which provides that $2.5 million will be paid to DPS over a ten year period to address the impact the Saint Anthony redevelopment will likely have on their ability to provide services to the children in the area.The payment to DPS will be made from incremental property taxes generated from blocks one, two and four and will be paid first before any reimbursement to the BLOCK three project. As the BLOCK three project was part of the original evaluation that DPS made.In looking at the redevelopment of the entire area, they are finding, they being DPS, that there is no additional impact as a result of us bringing forward the BLOCK three project and they have acknowledged the same in an agreement with the Urban Renewal Authority.With urban drainage and flood control. They also were notified of the proposed amendment to the redevelopment plan to add the BLOCK three project. Following that notification, urban drainage evaluated the impact the project would have on their services and determined that the BLOCK three project would have minimal service impacts and have agreed to allow the full available amountof property tax increment generated by their mill levy to be allocated to the project. This again was memorialized in a letter agreement between urban drainage flood control and the Urban Renewal Authority and finally with the loans metropolitan district.At the time, the St Anthony Urban Redevelopment Plan was approved, including the creation of the seven block property tax increment area. Dura and the South Sloan's Lake Metropolitan Districts entered into a cooperation agreement under which Defra agreed to pay over to the Metropolitan District any amount of property tax increment generated by their mill levy.So in closing, Dora is very pleased to be working with the city and the developer to bring forward this project. The redevelopment of this site, the adaptive reuse of an existing historic building, the addition of addition of new retail offerings and a mix of housing options will create a truly mixed use.Mixed income development on this block. This loans block three project advances many of the urban redevelopment plan objectives. And we are asking for your favorable consideration of this amendment and will be I will be happy to answer any questions you may have at the appropriate time.Thank you, Ms.. Huggins. We have two speakers this evening. When I call you names, if you would please come to the front. Cameron. Cameron. Bertrand and Doug. Elements. Cameron. You'll be first, Mr. Burch, on the 3 minutes. Thank you very much.Hi. I am Cameron Bertrand and I live at 1145 Gaylord Street in Denver. I also work for TFG, South Sloan's Lake One LLC, which is the current property owner of the site. So I just wanted to come up and add my support to the passage of adding this project to the urban renewal area, but also as thedeveloper of the St Anthony's site. Just take a moment to say that in some ways this is the culmination of a story that started back in 2013 when the council created the urban renewal area. And I think this is just the kind of project that we hoped would come forward.Historic preservation, environmental remediation, affordable housing, open space. It's a great outcome if you haven't been out to the site in a while. It's changed a lot. There are people living there and people shopping there and people eating there.And I think the variety of housing and neighborhood services that we wanted to see come about through the redevelopment of St Anthony's is really happening. And so in closing, I guess I would just thank everybody on City Council, your staff and in particularly the city and county of Denver staff, especially the public works and in this casealso community planning and development. A project like this doesn't often go off this well this fast. And really three and a half short years, the place has really transformed. And I credit that to the partnership with the city.Finally, I would just like to say thanks to Trail, Brake and Coble, it's always great to work on Denver projects with Denver developers and the Denver Urban Renewal Authority for all their work not only on this project but throughout the city.Anthony site. Thanks. Thanks so much. Available for questions if needed. Thank you, Mr. Bertram. Doug Alliance.Hi. Good evening. My name is Douglas Honowitz and I live at 99, 63 East 29th Avenue in Denver. And I'm here on behalf of Trailer Park Partners and Cable Joint Venture Partnership, known as Sloan's BLOCK three LLC. Catchy name that is the applicant and redevelop her for the purposes of the discussion here this evening in Sloan's BLOCKthree project. I echo what what Cameron was saying there this is tonight is really a culmination of years of work from a lot of people, both in the public and in the private sector, really trying to bring forward a terrific vision.And I appreciate council's consideration of the matter. The project that has been designed and that's being presented tonight is, is is really thoughtfully put together to try to realize some of the items that were contained in the general development plan for the St Anthony's area, in total from the urban redevelopment plan that was put in place backin 2013. And from our understanding of conversations over the years with the community members that were there historically and that have subsequently moved into the area, the vision really is to deliver upon a mixed use, mixed income project that serves the housing needs and the the services for this neighborhood in total from the work of the BoroughCommunity Groups, City Council and OED Jafa, who has been actively involved in it and others tonight we can realize that vision. Restoring an old building and putting it back into use. That's a connection to the past and very important past of St Anthony's here.This is one of those key pieces of the project, the hospital in total that's being saved and reused to continue to serve the community of Denver to mixed housing options for sale for and for rent and restaurant and other other services to the area.We just really think it's going to be a catalytic project that is respectful to the neighborhood boundaries, strengthens the relationship with the park. And we just we're excited to be bringing it forward and very much appreciate your consideration of it tonight and look forward to your support of this measure.Thank you very much. And likewise, I'm happy to answer any questions.Thank you, Mr. Leno. It's all right. This concludes our speakers. Now, are there questions for members of council? All right. Public hearing from counsel Bill 55 is now closed. Comments from his counsel, Councilman Espinosa. Yeah, I just I'm glad that Cameron is here.Doug here with Tracy. I want to thank you, Cameron. I know early in my time in office, we had talks about the balance of this property and what it would be. And there was a question about the life of the Coleman building and what was going to be viable there.And we knew that we needed partnerships. And you established how that could be, but we still needed to find a developer willing to follow through. And when I met Doug and he came forward with this concept for affordable housing, it sort of filled a big it was it was filled a big void that was very much inneed. And so I really I want to thank you for for bringing this forward being and everybody, Doug in our dialog and Tracy for helping see this through because we had good public meetings, we got good output and I mean good input and we're at a place on this development which is which is well, I'm heartened bythis phase three. I'm not going to lie. I wish I wish it wasn't going to beat out the, you know, two blocks that are still sitting there vacant. And I wish we could have sort of built that sort of collaboration and seen those things through, particularly in BLOCK Two, because I thought we we had a good dialogleading up to that. But anyway, I do I probably shouldn't have mentioned that, but I do I do think that there is a nexus for the future and the vision you guys had put forward. And it is missing those two pieces.And I look forward to someday moving forward on that. But in the meantime, I think this is a great proposal and I think the city and the team for persevering and making it happen. So to Doug, Tracy and Cameron, thank you very much.Looking forward to supporting this. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilwoman Ortega.Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to go back to when these two gentlemen started this project with a lot of community meetings with the Sloan's Lake neighborhood. I attended a number of those at the old St Anthony's Hospital when the building was still there.And to see the progress that's been made in this short time frame and the fact that you're here tonight and there aren't any residents from the community, you know, testifying, says a lot about the important work that you have done with the Sloan's Lake neighborhood over these years.So first, I want to say congratulations and I'm happy to support these bills tonight. Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Ortega. Councilman Cashman.Thank you, Mr. President. Affordable housing, affordable housing, affordable housing. Thank you for what you're doing.Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Castro and Councilman Lopez.Thank you, Mr. President. I also wanted to extend my support for these for this bill. You know, it's been a long time coming. And, you know, I grew up just south of the hospital. My sister was born at the hospital.Broken nose at the hospital, not at the hospital, but, you know, ended up there. They didn't do a good job, obviously. But I'm pleased to see it develop. I, you know, had a meeting, a good meeting with Dora and Rose Cameron with the development side to really talk about the affordable housing and, you know, the effort thatwas made there. But the need in the future to really think about when we look at affordable housing and look at units that they are not just one bedrooms, that they are two, two and three bedrooms, because that's when we talk about families.Right. We can call one bedrooms, affordable housing anywhere in the city. But when you really look at the need that's out, there's two bedrooms. So when we look at developments, we look at it from look at it with opportunity to create those two bedrooms.So here's the here's the deal on West Colfax. We've seen such a lack of of development and such. And it's been really hard and a lot of hard work with the West. Colfax did kind of pushing that forward.And I think it's about time. It just saddens me that we can't do more. The retail side of this site to really bring that out. You know, I think Councilman Herndon, this is something that you and I have both talked about in the past.But when we look at the edges of this city, we have we are competing with our regional neighbors. They're building Belmar. We're building residential. So it's a it's important for us to be able to keep those Denver dollars and the Denver tax base in Denver and to really support those projects that do that and add a goodquality of residential to the neighborhood. So here's to it moving forward. Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Lopez, it has been moves in Sacramento. Secretary Roll Call.Espinosa. Flynn.I.Gilmore. I. Herndon.I.Cashman. I can eat. Lopez. I knew Ortega. Sussman Black. All right. Clark. All right, Mr. President.I police close voting announce the results. 3939 Council Bill 55 has passed. Congratulations. All right, but we are not done. Councilman Espinosa, will you please put Council Bill 57 on the floor? Yes, Mr. President. I move that.

The recommendations conduct a budget hearing on the 2015 budgets for the Departments of Health and Human Services, Public Works and the Water Department.Before I turn this over to Mr. West, we'll do this in the same format. We've done the other budget hearings. Mr. WEST. We'll go through we'll go through all the all the departments, and then we'll bring it back to the two questions for council, and then we'll open it up to the public.Mr. West Mayor, Councilmembers. This is just another one of our budget hearings regarding showcasing some of our departments. Tonight, you're going to hear from our Health and Human Services Department, our public works department and our water department. Our first stop is going to be the Health and Human Services Department with Director Kelly Collopy.If you could remove the slide. We wanted to highlight that. Originally, we attempt to have like Parks and Recreation, Library and Health and Human Services along with P.D. and Fire, because we considered these departments very tight with our public safety continuum.So we just want to know and let you know that Health and Human Services the department are going to hear from tonight. We're very, very, very closely with all aspects of PD and fire specifically and keeping people healthy, providing affordable housing in some cases, adding our Section eight certificates.They do, I believe, 7000 units a year serving 20,000 people in poverty. And in addition to that, our homeless population. So they're very, very important with our public safety continuum, working with PD and Fire. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Kelly.Good evening, honorable mayor and city council members. Thank you for this opportunity to share the Health and Human Services Department budget and priorities. We are one of the three city health jurisdictions in California with Pasadena and Berkeley. We are one of the lucky few with an account within a county of 10 million people.You have a department whose sole focus is to coordinate over $116 million from outside sources, bringing best practice, innovative services and over 300 employees committed to improving the health of your city. It allows for local focus and local control of resources to support city goals and meet city needs.In addition, we are in a place to coordinate the many departments and services from Los Angeles County in a more integrated approach locally and in coordination with our local nonprofits and health care system. The Health and Human Services Department is a key player in the overall continuum of public safety in the city and considered one of thethree legs of the emergency response triangle in partnership with police and fire. We work closely with city staff on emergency preparedness and response to ensure the public safety of our residents. We actively engage community members in preventing the spread of disease through public education workshops, clinical lab services and responding to natural and man made disasters.As a recognized health jurisdiction in the state, in partnership with the CDC and other California health departments, we are the key surveillance information and prevention hub for infectious diseases that can affect the health and safety of Long Beach residents.Our day to day Health and Human Services programing directly impacts the quality of life and public safety of the city of Long Beach. We address health through the lifespan from before birth until death. Creating opportunities for healthier families and neighborhood environments by increasing access to health opportunities.In addition, we work collaboratively with various departments and community partners to create an integrated health systems approach to provide a wide array of services. Our core services are promoting and encouraging healthy, active living through health, education, immunizations, testing and treatment programs for families and their children and services to seniors to improve the quality of life.We ensure safe, physical environments by testing the city's recreational waters, doing restaurant inspections and training, hearing, load testing, mosquito abatement, disease surveillance and prevention and emergency and disaster preparedness and response. We also improve access to healthy, active living by supporting families with housing assistance, outreaching to homeless populations for housing placement and supportive services, expanding community gardens andneighborhood fitness zones, and expanding health coverage to the underinsured and the uninsured. Our accomplishments this year. We have over 30 programs and many accomplishments. So this is just a sample of the many things that we've achieved this year.First of all, we provided safe and affordable housing to approximately 21,000 residents and nearly 7000 units in the city of Long Beach. We were recognized in the American Diabetes Association Education Program. The city of Long Beach as highly impacted by diabetes, with over 42,000 people in Long Beach having been diagnosed with diabetes and many more are undiagnosed. One in three hospitalizations are due to diabetes. Our department provides diabetes education in English and Spanish in a six weeks program. This recognition indicates we are a best practice site and we'll be working very closely with our health care providers as referrals so that we can support their patients and helping them manage their diabetes.We expanded access to nutrition and exercise citywide by reaching nearly 25,000 youth and their parents through programs such as Long Beach, Junior Runners, the Junior Champions Program, Harvest of the Month and Kill Zone in North Long Beach. We saw a reduction in infant mortality by 44% over ten years.This dramatic decline is as a result of the health department and their partners across all sectors. Our community working together to ensure that mothers have access to healthy food, engage in physical activity, and are linked to care and social services programs in the Health Department, including Nurse Family Partnerships, our work program and Black Infant Health.Among many, we were able to reduce the tobacco access rate among youth from 36% in 2009 to 7.8%, the lowest in history. This is done by the Health Department or the Environmental Health Bureau conducts routine inspections to ensure compliance with tobacco laws.We conducted 493 last year and we implement tobacco decoy operations where teenagers go in and try and buy tobacco products. And if they do sell them, then they're cited. We also provided over 23,000 clinical visits at the Health Department, and these include family planning, STD, HIV, tuberculosis and immunizations.We delivered nearly 18,000 immunizations last year, many of them free or at a reduced cost. And finally, it's not on the slide, but we held a public health conference this past year for over 400 people who are engaged in serving the health of our community.It was a huge hit, and we received a national award for our social media campaign, which highlighted our city's innovative use of technology. I proposed budget. Our budget is about $717 million of that. 77 million of it goes to housing authority to support low income housing in the community.It goes through housing vouchers. 38 million of it is from the health fund that the health fund is made up of re-alignment funds, which is vehicle licensing fees and sales tax, other fees and grants. About less than 1% of our department's budget comes from general fund.Our major changes for this year in the budget is really a focus on stabilizing our workforce and maximizing our grant funding. Almost all changes in our Health and Human Services budget are health related rather than general fund. A key focus is to ensure we have sufficient staffing to maximize our grant resources that we receive.This includes moving previously part time employees to full time and combining part time and non-career positions to provide full time positions. We realigned two positions to address the impact of Affordable the Affordable Care Act. Last year, nearly 2000 individuals received direct enrollment assistance from our department.We provided education outreach to another thousand individuals in the city. We extended hours and participated on weekends and fairs and an open hours. This extra capacity will help us when enrollment season opens again. The Health Department is also currently going through the National Public Health Accreditation Process, which ensures that our department is engaged in best practice inpublic health. To assist in this year long effort. We have created a vacant position to lead this effort as well as support ongoing implementation of our five year strategic plan. And finally, we added a chronic homeless initiatives coordinator who will coordinate local and regional entities to mitigate homeless encampment locations, manage the COG Homeless Initiative and the DowntownHomeless Connections Initiative, funded by the Hilton Foundation. This person will also lead the city's effort to track, monitor and respond to chronic homeless. Working with our quality of working with quality of life teams, the Met Teams and the DOJ.The funding for this position will be split between general fund and grant funding and approximately $49,000 each. Our issues and opportunities coming up. I had the opportunity to attend the mayor council retreat over the weekend and to hear about the vision for the city.What you described really is a healthy city. In addition, you focused on collaboration as a mechanism to achieve it. Each of the departments you've heard from so far. Plus Public Works, Development, Service and Workforce have been engaged in collaborative planning to build the health of our city together.We'll also be engaging in conversations and planning with many community partners who are engaged in supporting our city's health. And we look forward to engaging you in this conversation as well. Our Continuum of Care received the unified funding agency status, which will allow for greater flexibility in local resources targeting to address homeless.We are one of only two nationally to receive this designation. The other being Columbus, Ohio. This is seen as a national best practice and they're actually turning to us to help them organize it and figure out how to.Move it forward.Health and wellness. Health and wellness really includes being physically and mentally healthy. We're seeking to expand mental health opportunities in the city through work with new funding sources and partners. In addition, we're working to integrate mental health services into our clinical services to improve the likelihood that people will access them.We've been participating in a pilot with Mental Health America as an integrated service model, and the early results are promising. We're looking to seek we're seeking to continue this model moving forward. Another key issue for us is improving the coordination of local data systems.There are many data systems in many organizations related to health in our city. However, the data are not coordinated and they're not easily accessed across our system. The stymies effective planning and Coordination of Service. The Health Department is planning to implement a common database to track health indicators in the city.In addition, we'll be working closely with our partners to ease data, access for planning, coordination and reporting. In other issues, return is reducing health disparities in our diverse neighborhoods. Research indicates the social determinants of health such as poverty, trauma, safety, education, employment have a significant impact on individuals and communities.In Long Beach, we have neighborhoods who are heavily impacted by social issues that are struggling with their ability to improve their health overall. A key challenge for us with our partners is providing the same opportunity for health in all of our neighborhoods.And finally, identifying sustained funding for our services. 84 7% of our resources come from federal, state and local grants management. Department of Programs. With grant funding as a primary source of revenue is both a science and an art.Thankfully, my staff have both of those skills. While some grants are stable and we've been receiving them for years, others are more project specific with limited time periods. In addition, we are directly impacted by policy and funding changes at all levels of government and sometimes with little notice.While we've learned to be nimble and do our best to maintain staffing and to maintain and grow services, we seek more sustainable funding solutions in the future. So each of our presentations so far have been framed as the public safety continuum, and we're so pleased to be part of it.But I'd say there were also our key players in the health continuum of Long Beach. Physical and behavioral health promotion is a crime reduction strategy. It's an education strategy. It's an employment strategy. Crime reduction, education, employment are also health promotion strategies.They're also closely intertwined, although we tend to talk about them separately. Health, safety, education. Sustainable income, housing in place are keys to success of the people in Long Beach and Brenda one breaks down. The likelihood of success is reduced.When people are physically and mentally healthy, they do better in school, they do better at work, their families do better, and there's less crime involved to achieve a healthy line, which for everyone requires all of us. The partnerships across the city, our long standing, your Health and Human Services Department is a key resource for bringing and coordinatingoutside funding streams, social service and behavioral health partners, hospitals and other nonprofit agencies to build health and a coordinated strategy with you, our other departments, our communities, and our partners. I know we can achieve our collective vision of a long beach where people are healthy, safe and thriving.I look forward to working with you. This concludes my report and I'm available to respond to any questions you may have.Thank you. So next up, we will have public works with Director R MOYEN.And Mr. City Manager. Just wanted to let councilmembers know. We'll just allow staff to make their presentations and take questions at the end. Thank you.Good evening, Honorable Mayor and City Council. Thank you for the opportunity to provide a brief overview of the public works departments at 515 proposed budget. To put our presentation in context. When residents step out of their homes, businesses open their doors and visitors come to Long Beach, they see public works whether they realize it or not.Every street, sidewalk, traffic, light, storm drain, street sweeper, refuse truck, tree trimmer, graffiti truck or traffic sign and a pothole truck affects the public in one way or another. In order to maintain a structurally balanced operating budget, we focus on core service delivery.It is Public Works mission to maintain and enhance the city's infrastructure and environment for the benefit of the public. The department's five bureaus have very diverse functions, including building and roadway design and construction, infrastructure maintenance, refuse and recycling, stormwater management and real estate services.We envision a better tomorrow by serving and exceeding the expectations of the public through the performance of our valued employees. Although we have very diverse functions, our core services are to provide for and maintain safe and adequate infrastructure for the community, provide for sustainable environmental protection in a positive service environment, and safely and efficiently design, construct, deliver, protect or maintain services for the public facilities public right away and stormwater management. Next. That's why 14 has been a very productive year for public works with the ongoing and one time funding provided by the City Council. Some of our accomplishments are we completed $74 million in capital improvement projects, including libraries, recreational, other buildings, park infrastructure andtraffic signals. This includes 5.8 million of sidewalk repairs totaling 22 miles and 34 million in arterial and residential streets, totaling 73 lane miles. We completed the construction of Chaddock Field and or Zumba Park Community Center, installed class, two bike lanes on seven major streets and class three bikes, bike lanes, routes on three major, major streets collected 190,000tons of trash for residential and commercial accounts swept 155,000 miles of streets and alleys and collected 10,176 tons of materials. Environmental Services Bureau Refuse Diversion Recycling Program has been very successful. Customers generated only £3.7 per person per day, far exceeding the state mandate of reducing the trash generated to a maximum of £7.6 per person per day.We repaired 40,000 potholes. The major and secondary thoroughfares response rate was within three days and local streets and alleys response rate was within 15 days. We responded to and removed 957,000 square feet of graffiti within 24 hours and of being reported trimmed, 26,500 trees removed, 400 tree stumps, and we strive to center lines of miles of citystreets, responded to 22,000 facility, 9000 traffic signal and 11,200 go Long Beach and not service requests and completed the 9 million remodel of Pacific Ballroom at the Arena. I would like to add that my regularly scheduled meetings with each one of you has been valuable to maintain constant communication and ensure we're on the track with service delivery. We are having some technical difficulties. Public works overall budget is 145 million. As you can see, we manage a significant number of funds. All briefly mentioned key funds shown on the pie chart, starting at the top and going clockwise.The capital project funds are 4.2 million is primarily for for sidewalks with the balance for pothole repair and bike paths. 44 million is for the refuse collection and contract recycling operations, waste diversion programs and litter free Long Beach Program.Public Works 32.7 million General Fund portion is 8.6% of the city's general fund with offsetting revenue. Our general fund impact is only $7.5 million. The Civic Center Fund of 9.9 million handles the ongoing civic center system, custodial and parking operations, $15.6 million of gas stock Street Improvement Fund.Our money's received from the state for ride away improvements. The transportation fund of 14.6 million includes monies received from the county for transportation purposes. Prop eight for 3 million. Prop C 6.5 million and Measure R points for 4.9 million.Tidelands is primarily for the aquarium and public parking lots, commercial center and PDC permits and compliance and beach parking enforcement. As you know, the stormwater environment is important. Just to provide a little background to this. The city has four major beaches.Each council district generates non stormwater runoff that is transported through street gutters, storm drain pipes, ditches and channels and then two rivers and eventually ending at the beaches. The city of Long Beach is mandated to comply with the Clean Water Act guidelines through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Elimination System Permit, in accordance with the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency and State Water Resources Control Board. Within the permit, the city is responsible for nine total maximum daily load compliance regulations. Fines totaling from noncompliance with the NYPD's permit can range from 5000 to $10000 per day, a violation.There are 17 participating cities in the three watersheds Lower L.A. River, lower San Gabriel, San Gabriel River and Los Cerritos Channel that contribute additional money for their portion of monitoring plan and watershed management programs. The program directly impacts the quality of life in our rivers and beaches.The 199,000 will fund the Lower L.A. River, Lower San Gabriel River and Los Cerritos Channel. Watershed to handle compliance monitoring. The 451,000 will fund the Greater Los Angeles Long Beach Toxic Pollutants and Los Angeles Liver River Estuary and Long Beach handle as as well as the Alamitos Bay Compliance Monitoring.According to cities and PDS permit, 395,000 and Tidelands funding is to be to develop a citywide master watershed management program and a reasonable assurance analysis which will include the Greater Los Angeles. Long Beach Harbors, Long Beaches and Alamitos Bay.Public Works plays an essential role in maintaining and enhancing the community's quality of life. During the past year, I've taken the opportunity to review our operations and obtain employee feedback on how best to move our department forward. We're looking at ways to restructure service delivery.As mentioned in the mayor's budget, recommendations will look forward to working with employees and the street sweeping division on implementing efficiencies such as reducing the street sweeping time block. The payment management program I initiated is winding down, and we will have a comprehensive report on our street condition shortly.As technology expands, the Long Beach reporting will also impact our resources. Significant strides have been made in the last few years to address the city's aging infrastructure with additional nonrecurring funds. However, it is not anticipated that these non recurring funds will be available at the level in the in the near future.Aging infrastructure is a constant issue facing our city. Our 23 storm drain pump stations are approximately 60 years old and serve service at 380 miles of active stormwater infrastructure, including pipes, open channels, ditches, culverts and drains. Public Works has identified that the storm main pump stations need to be refurbished as they are unable to support the needs. The wide variety of core services public works provides positively affects residents, businesses and visitors within our city. Public Works School is to provide as many of these essential services seamlessly. To put the level of service in perspective. Public works inventory includes 800 miles of streets, 215 miles of alleys, 600 miles of sidewalks, 600 miles of curb andgutter, over 400 public buildings, 145 bridges, 190 miles of storm drains, 23 pump stations, 303,900 catch basins, 95,000 street trees, 180,000 traffic signs, 640 traffic signals, 3300 parking meters and nearly 125,000 refuse and recycling accounts. I take pride in our 421 public works employees that deliver quality, ongoing program and CIP projects on a daily basis.Thank you for your support in the past and I look forward to working with each one of you going forward. This concludes my report.I think you are next is Kevin water with the water apartment and I believe in the audience is the chairman of the water commission.I think.Good evening, Mayor Garcia, members of the Council, thank you for the opportunity to present the water department's budget there. It comes for fiscal year 2015. And I would like to introduce the president of the water commission, Harry Salts gave her.It was right up here with the bright red tie. So it's easy to see. Go ahead. In the water department, we have two separate and distinct funds. The water fund and the sewer funds are there. They're the. It's just as it sounds.The costs of the water fund are provided for by our water fees and the sewer fund. Likewise. So I'll cover the water fund first and then later the sewer fund. The water fund there. You can see on the the pie chart on the left is by far the largest fund.It constitutes about 84% of our budget. And then the sewer fund, about 16%. And then you see the the breakdown of our major components of our water fund. So roughly two thirds of it is non-personal services or operation and maintenance costs.And we'll talk about some of those on the next slide. About 20% is our personnel or personal services budget, and then our capital budget is about 13 million. Really, what's driving what's happening with the water department is really this slide is the key to it.This shows you we get 60% of our water supply from the groundwater basin and 40% of it we buy from the Metropolitan Water District. And what you're seeing here is a chart that shows on the top what the rates we were charged by the Metropolitan Water District have done since 2008 through 2015.And what the the charges that we pay to the water replenishment district for the groundwater that we pump have done, and in both cases, they've gone up 81% over that time period. So the numbers on the top are in dollars per acre foot for those of you that are are trying to follow this.And then the graph on the bottom is in millions of dollars. So you can see and if you look at it, that basically those costs have gone up about $14 million. So while we've absorbed in some cases these 81% increases in costs from the Metropolitan Water District and the the water replenishment district, our rates, including the 4%rate increase we're proposing for 2015, have only gone up 44%. So we've been absorbing many of these costs and have been running a deficit budget for the last few years now. And so we came to the water commission last year into the City Council.And the next slide will show that we couldn't continue to run a deficit budget forever. We've been using reserves to meet this deficit. So last year was the first year of our five year finance plan on our water on our water budget.This chart shows you the remaining four years with fiscal year 15, they're highlighted in yellow. The finance plan essentially accomplishes two objectives. By 2018, it would balance our budget, so it will bring our revenues and expenditures into balance.It's right now unbalanced, as you can see, to the tune of about $7 million deficit budget in 15. And the other thing it would do is it would use our remaining reserves to to smooth those rate increases in.So we what our studies show and what we did this year and what we're proposing, again, in 15 is that with 4% rate increases by 2018, we achieve those two objectives of being in a balanced budget situation and having our reserve level at the 11 to $12 million target, which is what the rating agencies have told us, is the lowest amount that they'd like us to maintain as a as a reserve for our water fund. And so we have assumptions of continuing rate increases from MWD and the water replenishment built into that plan. And of course, if we can be successful at reducing those, then our future rate increases would come down accordingly.But again, this is what's driving our our budget and our rate increases as these increased costs from MWD and the water replenishment district. Moving out of the sewer fund. We have a similar situation there. We were faced with some new regulations about seven years ago that required us and other water utilities or other utilities that operate sanitarysewer systems to greatly expand our sewer activities, both in terms of maintenance, cleaning, inspection and capital investment. And so we've been doing that now for the last seven years or so. So there you see the sewer budget broken down again.It's heavy on O&M or non-personal services. And about a $4 million or about a 20% of our sewer fund goes towards capital improvement programs. Go ahead. The situation we're facing with the sewer system is so we've been in spending this additional money for the last several years now out of a line of credit, we took $20 million, line of credit we opened several years ago. Now we've been able to extend that twice. It's a very low interest, a line of credit we wish we could continue forever, but it is going to expire in 2017. And so that's what's planned for here is in 2017 to retire that outstanding, outstanding line of credit and convert itto a regular long term debt issuance where we'll have to be paying both principal and interest. So that's why you see a fairly large increase in our expenditures as we go from 2016 to 2017, almost $1,000,000 in increase as we start making principal payments on that line of credit after we convert it.And again, we've got nominal increases assumed in our budget. And then again, what you see here is, is that by 2019, we again would achieve a balanced budget, our revenues and expenditures would be in balance and our reserves would be down to around $4 million, which is again the target for our sewer fund, for our rating agencies. They'd like us to maintain about $4 million in the sewer fund. So that's so again, our forecast there is we need a 4% rate increase this year and then 5% rate increases each of the next four years to achieve those two objectives.Go ahead. So what does this mean in terms of rates? Again, what we're proposing for 15 is a 4% increase in both the water and sewer rates. How does that stack up? Go ahead. On the typical monthly bill.This shows are our combined water and sewer rates for a typical single family home in Long Beach. Compare how it's changed over the years. You see that what the increase there, the total increase the purple is the water and the yellow or gold is the sewer and it's against a 4% increase in total is $2.12 on thecombined water and sewer bill. How does this compare to other cities throughout California and our peers in our in our area? This is the total water and sewer bill. And in this analysis, we also include the fee that our property owners in Long Beach pay to the sanitation districts through their property tax bill.So it's a true apples and apples comparison because there is an additional fee that that's paid for sewer service provided for the sanitation districts. So when you combine that, you see how we compare to what's called the L.A. County Average, a grouping of cities in Los Angeles County, how we compare to other large cities in the state. And then we also like to show Golden State Water, which is a private utility that provides water service in a very small part of northeast Long Beach. We provide their sewer service, but Golden State provides the water service.So the entire difference there for the Golden State customers is, is their increased water bill that they pay to Golden State water. And I think I'll I'll conclude with a couple of comments that are that I don't think I should be here tonight and not talk about the drought and conservation.I want to thank the members of the Council for your ongoing support of what we've been doing in the law, in the water department and for what you've been doing in the community. This is a very, very serious drought that we're engaged on.You've all heard that Long Beach is once again leading California through this drought. I'm sure you've seen that we in July, we reduced our consumption for water to the lowest level since 1958. We'll do the same again in August and we'll go for a three peat in September.So this is a very, very impressive thing that the city of Long Beach is doing. I want to thank the council. I want to thank the city departments who are working closely on this. And I certainly want to thank our constituents who are doing a wonderful job of setting a great example for the entire state of California. With regard to water conservation, we don't know how long this drought is going to go on. So the more we can save, the better we are. Thank you very much.Thank you. And thank you all for the for the presentations. What we're going to do is we're going to first, I just wanted to make a quick comment. I just wanted to thank there's a lot of you in the audience that are either here for this or public comment.And thank you for for bearing with the longevity of tonight to this point. I also want to ask the heads of each of the departments one department head can each can take the mic so that when we ask the questions, it can go go smooth.So someone from water, someone for our public works at as well as our health and human services. That way the questions can be asked and we'll have a smooth process. And we'll start with Councilmember Price.Thank you. I wanted to address the Department of Health and Human Services, and thank you really for the work that you do with the homeless program and operations that we have in the city. I was recently at a restaurant and a resident came up to me, which happens a lot more often than I ever envisioned nowadays.But a restaurant. A customer came up to me, also a resident of the third and said, you know, talks about the homeless problem and the issue that they perceived as a problem to be near the Belmont Pier area.And and said, you know, why are aren't the homeless and why doesn't cities like Newport and Corona Del Mar have the same issues with the homeless? And I explained to them that because Long Beach is not Newport or Corona Del Mar or Long Beach, and how very proud I am of our Health and Human Services Department andtrying to work proactively and with the limited resources that you have to come up with constructive solutions that provide those individuals with options, choices and positive. Options that are available to them that otherwise wouldn't be without our city.So I wanted to highlight that and and say that I understand that you're working with a very limited budget when it comes to our homeless programs and the efforts that you do for that program. Can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of anything new that you plan to do in the coming year to enhance theprogram that we currently have?We received the unified funding agency status, which is that for the continuum of care, what that will allow us to do is to be more flexible in the way that we the way we use our resources for homeless.So as we see different priorities pop up, it will allow us some more flexibility in how we address those issues. In addition, we're working very closely, as you know, with the quality of life teams and with our met teams.Quality of life is with the police department, includes an officer and a mental health provider to do outreach. So as people are seeing homeless and they're seeing situations where we ask that you do contact us because we will send outreach workers out.And the multi-service center is being it's under construction right now. It will open again in October. At that time, we will have our partners co-located there and we will continue to do all of the different services that we've that we've done in terms of helping people find housing and address their other needs.Well, thank you for the work that you do, and we look forward to supporting you in any way that we can.Thank you. Appreciate.Council, Councilmember Gonzales.Thank you and thank you for the report. So I'll first start with Health and Human Services. Again, I have to reiterate. Thank you very much. I know we see the effects in the First District because we often see homeless individuals.And quick story, we I believe your outreach group took a family off the streets, a family of about four or five off our 14th Street area. So it was a huge deal to not see them, you know, struggling up out in the street.So that's just one example of how we see it every single day. So just in speaking with the homeless coordinator that I think you have proposed here, I know there's some reorganization within your department. Is that replacing anything or is that in addition or what what can we expect from or what is that position exactly?The new position is in addition, it's not replacing replacing any service. It will this person will help sort of coordinate, exist, coordinate new programs and existing programs. They'll be there to provide greater coordination around outreach to the chronic homeless population and to work with that to work with other grants.We see it as providing up to 2000 hours of extra outreach because they'll be sort of helping to reduce some of the other work of other people who are doing direct service.Great. Thank you. And public works are a thank you for your presentation. I just have to say thank you for all that you do because I we also see the work, you know, in our district daily. And if I can just say one thing, I know it wasn't really touched on here, but just in regards to justprivatization and inner city employees. And I know that it's it's really important, you know, in my perspective, to be able to identify other cost savings, to be able to keep our street sweepers, our refuse and other city employees, you know, within within the city.And that's certainly something that, you know, I'm supportive of and just. Thank you. That's all I wanted to say.Thank you very much.And also, actually, I think we love the street sweepers. Can they sweep our alleys? I know we talked about that, but that's something that always comes up. So I hope that, you know, we can certainly address that somehow.As we discussed yesterday at your budget presentation. By request, we will have streets. I mean, street sweepers will go into the alleys. But it's not a program that we have currently. But if there is a need, will accommodate that.Great. Thank you. And then lastly, the water department. I just wanted to also say thank you as well. I know you're great work. It's very progressive initiatives. Linda Garden, we, you know, handle a lot of that in our office, keeping our rates low and also being fiscally responsible.Thank you. And and a question about cast iron pipes. I know that when do we expect to upgrade those outdated pipes or what is the process for that?We've been regularly replacing cast iron pipes, which is our oldest pipes, which are the ones that are most susceptible to breakage since the early 1990s. So over 20 years we've had a significant program. We've replaced about half of them thus far.So, you know, the remaining half will take us about another 30 to 40 years. But, you know, so again, strategically, we've replaced all the ones that we've had problems with. As we talk with your office and particularly in your district, a lot of the ones that are in your district are in the alleys.That's a very difficult situation and a lot more time consuming and and expensive. But again, at the rate we're going, it's about a 30 to 40 year period before we replace the remaining little less than half that we still have.Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Mongo.Yes. I want to start by thanking the great work of our health and public health department. For those of you who don't know, I started my county career as a budget, a budget analyst for health services, L.A. County.And so the work that you do is imperative. And I appreciate how thin of a margin our matching funds are against the revenue that you draw down. That's quite a testament to both our financial management division and your department to be able to leverage those funds effectively.One of my areas of concern is that over the last 10 to 15 years, mental health funds into the region have more than doubled, in some cases almost tripled. And our city has not seen that same gain in grants.Is there any strategy that we could take in the next few years to better partner? I believe L.A. County has seen an increase from in the $700 million area, up to $1.9 million in terms of additional funding to the region.I recognize that a large portion of that is to deal with some of the issues in our correctional facilities. But there are a lot of correction facilities to community programs, as a lot of our officers will attest to, that we have many issues in pulling them out and back into society in a meaningful way.Are we working on that with our probation officers and our police officers? Is there a way to draw down that major funding?Yes. So there there are multiple different services in Long Beach to the Department of Mental Health from L.A. County, has an office here and they provide direct service. We're working very closely with them. Mental health America provides there are key partner with that with us in providing mental health services as part of our continuum of care andother services. They're also part of our integrated physical health and mental health program that we're working on in terms of working with our criminal justice partners. We are in conversation. We are we will be one of the pilots through the L.A. County Mental Health Diversion Program with Jackie Lacey.So we we have been meeting and talking about that with both the police department and with the city prosecutor's office to develop that model. And we will be working with L.A. County to look to move that forward. Our goal is, is that we can address those issues here before they end up in the L.A. County jail.Please let me know how I can be helpful. Public Works. Thank you for your expedient response to the flood of constituent requests through the GO app recently. We've received a lot of positive feedback in the effective ways that your staff have responded to our graffiti issues that have recently arisen from some releases that we've had in thearea. Could you give us a quick update on the Street Payments Pavement survey?Yes. Approximately a year ago when I joined the city, as far as being the direct, not the director of public works but the city engineer, my first vision was to update our 2005 payment management plan. We have already a consultant on board that have finished their survey.We're working on the the implementation phase of it. I should have a very comprehensive plan for you within the next month or so. So after you're done with your major hearings, I'll bore you with that.And will that comprehensive plan come with a dollar amount that would be required to move our current street conditions to a. More manageable scale of accountability across the city.I will give you all that data in regards to where we are with the current index. How much money we need to spend per year to stay as status quo. And what you need to do to increase that index.Great. I look forward to it. And thank you for your partnership on a potential program that we might be bringing to the fifth District soon. Related to pilot programs will add efficiency to our street sleepers while not outsourcing that.My grandfather was a tree supervisor for the city, and I know the great pride that our community employees take in the streets that they drive down and that they live in our community and they care about our community.We recently had a few calls for service, about one medium, and there was a a street sweeper, and he didn't he got a new route and he didn't know about this particular median and which day of the week it was handled.And I thought he was very professional in his response to our constituents and they've given some great positive feedback. So thank you for making the adjustments to the route. And lastly, last week I made my first water waster app declaration, so I'm sorry to the resident who was wasting water, but you have been reported, I think thatyour app is wonderful. It is both creative and innovative. The kids in the community of our neighborhood association have been tasked as water enforcement officials and their parents have used their little not iPhones, but they play iTunes on it.We call it an iPod there, their Wi-Fi, iPods to report. So you will be getting many reports from the fifth District soon as we have deputized a team of young people. And I wanted to comment on the lawn to garden program has typically been only for turning a grass lawn into a garden.One of the things that's happened in our community is we've actually explored artificial turf, and that's currently an expense that's completely burdened by the homeowner. I've made that personal choice to change over, but some of our senior citizens are less likely to make that kind of change because of the restrictions and moderate income that they're depending on. And so I appreciate the discussions we've had on a pilot program to potentially experiment with a lawn to garden option and was hoping that, Kevin, you might be able to let us know it would 90 days or 120 days be a reasonable amount of time to discuss the components of that pilot program so that our senior communitycould reduce their water intake without any changes to the Neighborhood Association's happiness with their lawns.Oh yeah. I think 90 days is very reasonable. We can put a pilot program together and have it implemented within that time frame, I'm certain.Excellent. The senior citizens of my community. Appreciate it. Thank you. That I have no more questions.Thank you. Constable Richardson.Thank you, Mayor. I want to be I want to be quick, because I know there's a number of North Long Beach residents here waiting for the council meeting to begin. So. So let's let's start with. Well, we have water just that just chimed in.So I know with the scarcity of water and our our aging infrastructure and the increased price, you're hit with like a triple threat to your budget. So I'm happy that the the water water board and our president here's a ninth District resident Mr. Salts gave her.I'm happy the water board in the last council took steps to ensure that we will have a fiscally sound water department that will maintain services for our residents and jobs, you know, quality, quality employment here in the city.My question is really about the lawn garden program similar to Councilmember Price. So my wife and I, we just converted converted our lawn. We love it. It's low maintenance, relatively no water. But across the street from my home, the neighborhood across the street, they they don't have access to this program.And we've talked about it loosely. But I wanted to just ask out in the open, you know, there are certain areas in the town who aren't you know, who are not customers of Long Beach Water. I know that a significant portion of our lawn to garden programs funding does not even come from the city of Long Beach. What would it take to to expand a similar program to all corners of the city so that everyone can participate in this water conservation effort?Well, thank thank you for bringing that issue to our attention. We were actually unaware that you have a small section in your district that's served by the other large private water company that does business throughout this region. That's Canal Water region.That was the Domingo's Water Company. So so those constituents are eligible to apply through their water provider for the rebates that the Metropolitan Water District has. So that's $2 per square foot. So they could do that today. They wouldn't.So they wouldn't go through us. They're not our customers. And it wouldn't be appropriate for us to spend our ratepayers money since they're not contributing to our revenue stream. But they could do that today through their water providers.And same situation with Golden State in the fifth District. If we wanted to do more than that, then we'd have to have some legal analysis in terms of who would be appropriate to provide the additional funding to bring the level up to the $3.50 that we pay all of our ratepayers.Our ratepayers.Thank you, Kevin. And I don't know that the pilot would necessarily need to be the same program as what everyone gets, but even $2 is better than better than it really. We want to make sure that they're included in the outreach efforts and ensuring that they are they should they are encouraged to participate here.So what I'm really interested in is maybe a conversation at the at the commission level or maybe maybe we have a conversation about, you know, working with the city manager to work with these other agencies, Cal Water, Golden State Water, to ensure that we're taking this seriously and making it easier for our residents to do this.So that that would be my suggestion. I don't either respond to this point, but we're going to we're you know, that's something I'm interested in pursuing next. In terms of the health department, I want to begin by thanking them for the work that they do.They mentioned very clearly, Kelly mentioned very clearly that it's a science and an art to manage a department that's, you know, upwards 90% grant funds. Our office, the ninth district office, has worked with them very closely in the in recent years, and I've seen their commitment to our community.I was hoping you can provide an update on a couple of things. First, you mentioned very quickly a proposed healthy Long Beach plan that might be coming. That sounds really interesting. Could you just shed some light on that?As we started to look at all the different activities that we do across the city, across our departments, as well as a lot of the place based efforts, we all are working in a way that that applies to a healthy Long Beach.And so what we've been doing is meeting as a team of department directors. And so pretty much everybody you have heard from so far in terms of the public safety, the library, code enforcement, neighborhood services, as well as public works and workforce investment, all of us together are sitting down to say, okay, how do we, as acoordinated effort, move forward the health of this city? Because it takes all of us. There have been many plans that have been done so far within the city, including the Community Health Improvement Plan, the safe Long Beach violence prevention plan, mobility element.The land use element is underway. The housing element. We are working on a healthy living policy and there are active living principles. All of these things are already in place as well as a lot of strategic planning for many of our partners.And so we're coordinating all of that into one document and then starting to move that forward for the city.Thank you. I think that's really important to do. And along that same vein. Would you mind chiming in with a quick update on the Kaiser Permanente Heal Zone program in North Long Beach?Sure. So he goes on really is an example of how it takes all of us to move things forward. So we've been working with Public Works Department to make street improvements as a result of the walk out at findings at Grant Elementary, Starkey Elementary and Hamilton Middle School.We've been working very closely with the Parks Department around implementing a fitness zone at Coolidge Park, and we're putting in a new one also at Hilton Park. And we are in partnership with Long Beach Community Action Partnership. We have a grant elementary farmstand that's open after school every Tuesday when it's in session.And we're partnering with the Jordan High School AIMS program and working to identify and implement a project there to improve nutrition and fitness at the school, as well as working with the children's clinic to create sort of a voucher system where they can they can write a prescription and have a voucher redeemable at one of the localand at the farm stands at our healthy corner store, the farmer's market.Great. Thank you. And then finally, so I'm really interested in this chronic homeless initiative coordinator position. I remember just months ago, we pulled together a number of the agencies that that have homelessness issues in North Long Beach with their police by different agencies, Caltrans, L.A. County, flood control along the river, Southern California Edison right away.And and we we came together as all four agencies and talked about a strategy to to address these encampments from a holistic standpoint. Is this something that this position would take on and really build on?This position will be really coordinating different efforts such as that, as well as some of the other chronic chronic homeless initiatives.Yes. Great. Thank you. And then the public works. I'll be quick. A number. The questions I had were were a number of the questions I had Councilmember Mungo brought up. So I won't chime in there, but I will I will say that I am interested in seeing the valuation, the numbers that come back from this study asto how much it would cost to actually keep up with, you know, with the level of of the level our streets are or to improve on that. So I'm really interested in that. That's it. Thank you. That's all I have.Concern Boston.Well, I'll be shorter than Councilmember Richardson.But that won't be tough to do.And I know my colleagues in the audience would appreciate that. First of all, I'd like to just thank all three department heads for being here today, and thank you for the excellent work that you and your department put forth on behalf of the city of Long Beach.Each one of you have contributed in your departments, have contributed to making Long Beach a leader leading city in the state of California, particularly in the areas of health. I think we have the best public works department in the state and our water department is leading the way in conservation efforts as well.Noted. Now, my question is for Mr. Malloy, and right away something jumps out at me on the the financial summary and the budget, particularly in the 515 expenditures. It's markedly different than 514 in the areas of material, supplies and services.It's a significant reduction, I want to say close to $39 million. Can you explain that?I'm trying to find that. Is that part of our presentation or you're talking about the budget document.The document?Yes. Welcome. Can I have my document?You know what he was asking?So so under the proposed you got it.You're looking at adjusted f y 14 and propose that y 15. Correct the difference of 2 million.No, about 39 million.Oh, okay. So these are basically the one time funds that were allocated to public works to be able to perform all those projects. So it is just basically the one time funds that fluctuated from a 514.Okay. But it's it's under the line under the materials, supplies and services. So would it would it be largely weighted on services? Now he's talking about materials. I really. I thought this would be quick.So it takes a village to raise me, right? This. This is basically the difference between private services or services that we we have for all those special projects.Okay. So you have a significant or would you say you have enough in the budget to to carry out the services at the level we expect? Correct.So this year's budget, basically, it was flat for us. It's it's possible that what you're seeing and if y 15 is the movement of one of the bureaus into the city manager's office, therefore there will be a reduction in our budget.Okay. Thank you. Maybe we can get some further clarification on that at another later date. I'd like to also, while I have the director of the water department here, think your department is doing a great job. You know, we hate to see rate increases, but they were pretty much imposed upon us by the Metropolitan Water District.Is that correct? That's right. Can you explain the metropolitan water districts where rate increases and and and their reserve fund?No.I'll leave that up to our med director to do.And even I can't explain it.So so I understand that they have a pretty robust reserve, yet they rate raising rates.Absolutely. And I want everyone to know that Mr. Guardia has done a tremendous job to point out the financial irresponsibility of that. But to no avail.Okay. I just thought it was important for the public to understand that.But I wouldn't pass up this opportunity to give you some information. Please. So. So today at their board meeting, despite the fact that they revealed that instead of the $352 million in surplus reserves, surplus reserves that they last reported that they had, it was reported today that that was actually 400 between 400 million and 425 million.So another 50 to 75 million that materialized in the last two months of their last fiscal year. So despite that, they continue to raise their water rates and they kept their property tax at the same level as last year when they.The only reason they're supposed to be allowed to do that is if for purposes of financial necessity, they can't reduce their their parcel tax. So they made a decision today, which director Lowenthal did not vote for, which said that for purposes of financial necessity, they need to keep their property tax at the same level as last yearinstead of reduce it as they would otherwise otherwise be required to do by law. So I can't explain it.Well, thank you for the briefing. And I'm sure now that our that we're aware, our residents will pay a lot closer attention to what's going on in other public agencies that impact us. Thank you.Thank you. Thank you. Much shorter. We think just getting counts and branches.Thank you. Thank you, Mayor. And for all you individuals who don't know the budget in all nine districts, we will have a budget summit. So this is our quick. This should be. I just want to talk to the health department and the public works.One question. The population by seniors is growing in Long Beach in our current program and services in the health department. I just want to know if they're keeping up with the increase, you know, especially for our seniors.And that's for the health department.No. Okay.That's all I need.We we we are planning, though, it is a key strategic goal for us to increase those services. And we're working closely with Parks and Rec, who also have the senior centers, but that is a key focus areas of ours moving forward.Currently, we do not have the funding.I say that being a senior citizen. Thank you very much. The other would be public works. And I would like to know.How.Does we you know, how do we support our school and their recycling efforts?Could anyone tell me that in public works?Councilman Andrews, thank you for that question. This one I can answer gratefully. We this we required a city contractor, which is Waste Management, to provide recycling collection at all Long Beach schools. And we support the green for the green teams at different Long Beach schools and we provide technical assistance to the school.So we are definitely involved and we provide those services.Thank you very much. That's it.Thank you, Councilwoman Price.I'm not queued up.It was on the Red Canterbury ring.Uncomfy. Okay. But nobody ever addressed it wrong again. But actually, Councilmember Andrews, I was going to ask the same question about senior services, because it's not here in your in your for future applications. Some programs I would love to see some programing in their next next budget round or even shorter.You know, that's you know, for me, I just became a senior citizen. So there's a point for me as I reach another era in my life in regards to and this might be a totally different, different topic that we might be getting into.But I wanted to ask about the the housing, the affordable housing that's out there for 21,000 residents. So a thousand units I know that we've been talking about the housing element and the 20% set aside for affordable housing.Does that come into play with this at all or is there is there a nexus to this?The these units, they're they're the housing authority vouchers. So they are funding directly from the from HUD that that that we support people and working with different landlords to house them. It is not part of this piece of it is not part of the the building of additional housing.Yeah. Okay. That's a city manager question and you know, where are we going with that, with that, with that project, with with our housing authority, with the 20% set aside for affordable housing in the in the overall housing element?Yes. Earlier earlier and there was a report given in the Budget Oversight Committee where as Barack gave a presentation on the 20% housing set aside dollars that are coming back to the agency, that are getting repaid, back to the FSA, to the city, excuse me, in the form of affordable dollars and going to our housing trust fund. So that was a pretty thorough report. It's available in the Budget Oversight Committee and we could certainly give you that. Okay. Yeah, I missed that meeting, so I was wondering about that. Also, in regards to the Health Department, the yeah, $1 million in general fund, which is great.I mean, that really says a lot about the health department and all the money it brings in. I think I've said it before in regards to the wonderful staff you have and being able to go after grants and bring them to the city and but what does that 1 million go to using in general or general typesof services? I know some of it goes to homeless services.And those resources are primarily for homeless services.A good portion of it in. Okay. And I had one more than know when you're looking at identify sustained funding for the health department. What things are you looking at as examples.Looking at some different federal grants? There are a number of large federal grants out there right now looking at health promotion and other prevention strategies. So we have applied for a couple of purple. Of those are waiting to hear back.There are multimillion dollar grants we are working at, looking at different partnerships with our local health care systems and with other with other partners to start to build and more consistent grant funding that's not related to a specific project, a short term project, but something that is more sustainable.There might be an opportunity there for some senior services.That is one of those key areas we're looking at. Yes.All right. Wonderful. Thank you. That's it. Or by the way, I am not that I don't like water and public works. I love you guys. But I met with him earlier this week, too. I think I got a good orientation at that point.Thank you.Thank you. And finally, Councilman O'Donnell.Thank you. And I'll try to make this as efficient as possible with regard to public works. Thank you for all you do. You did a great job an of park started expanding that park about eight years ago and I just finished it off with a nice community center we opened a couple of weeks ago.Beautiful building, much loved by the community. So thank you. You did a lot of work this year on Stearns. We've got more to do now. WHALEY The same thing, more to do now. And we've got plans for the Nature Center done a little bit out there, but we'll do more.So thank you for your help on that. That's my point. You guys do wonderful work. All right? You're really on top of it. So thank you. Question about parking meters. As I recall, we were going to put 800,001 time money into parking meters.That's you right that your department, is that accurate?Correct. This is being worked with the city manager's office. I believe you had a two from four that explained where we going. There was an initial request from Belmont Shore Associates that they wanted to go to a more advanced technology as far as parking meters that utilize.ID cards. So we have done extensive studies. We have looked at financials, and our next task is to talk to the stakeholders. And when everybody is on board and understand what the issues are, we'll come back to city council.I guess I don't necessarily have a problem on the credit card. I've used those before, but the doubling of the rates, as I understand it, seems a little excessive to me even though they are competitive now. I think that's a bit of a jump and we're putting $800,000, I guess would be one time.General fund money to Belmont Shore keeps part of the funding. Correct. So would they carry part of the burden?Belmont will fund their SIPP portion. The 800,000 is for the rest of the city, which includes downtown and other areas that have parking meters.And downtown doesn't keep a portion of their money.Downtown keeps 50% of the parking, creates the rest, goes to the LBA.So they'll they too will carry some of the burden of the cost of the correct that that should happen shouldn't be all on the general fund if they're going to share some of the I mean they all they may have revenue.Balances now that would cover those expenditures.So again, they should participate in that. With regard to street sweeping, I hope we're working on finding some efficiencies there. I mean, around here, we've had the two extremes. And from my point of view, you know what, we're good at contracting out.We're good at cutting, but we're not good at finding efficiencies in innovation. And that's something we need to work on as a city. So I hope as we look at.The street sweeping bureau.RVO label it, that we can look at finding efficiencies and innovation over there that will save costs and enhance service levels. We've talked about the two hour window, etc., so I hope that that can be done and I hope that's ongoing.You know, Robin, you propose, hey, not contracting out. You know, Pat was on the path of contracting the amount that the council last council, not all of them, but put them on. And I get that. I mean, that's management, that's leadership.But we need both here and both means finding efficiencies in innovation. So I hope we can do that. I hope we can really look at that. I mean, a couple of years ago, we were going to contract out time.We never did. But did we ever find efficiencies in innovation there? I don't know. So again, let's think like that. We need to do more thinking like that. With regard to water, thank you. And are you going to meet with Parks and Rec tomorrow?As I understand it, I made some comments a couple of weeks ago that sparked some interest over on your site. I know I had a conversation with your president there. Great conversation. And hopefully we can find ways to work together on the on the water front, especially with regard to Parks and Rec, because it's so expensive forthem to maintain their their fields, etc., that, you know, our kids are on every weekend. And this isn't just about water, this isn't just about grass. It's also about what we want as a community for our kids. So that's a big deal to me.And with regard to your fund balances you have down here, I noticed the water fund and there's probably one on the sewer fund too. You talk about your ending fund balance. I'm assuming beyond your ending fund balance, you have reserves for your CFP projects too.So with these be separate from your CFP project, set it set aside dollars.You know, there's no there's no additional. So there is no it is. Okay. So I guess so it's that thing. That's it.Okay, great. And one other question for our I'm going to punch back to you on page ten of the community handbook. It talks about some one time expenditures and fleet. And I thought the way we funded fleet operations typically and you could correct me was that we bill interdepartmental so that when let's say you know the policedepartment has as a vehicle public works bills them I don't know maybe on a monthly basis $600 per vehicle. I don't know what it would be. And that would cover, you know, the maintenance and the cost of the vehicle.So my question would be, what are those one time expenditures? I believe they're $8. If off the top of my head, if I'm correct, 4 million I'm sorry, 4 million. It's a jump. And it says one time there.That's what piqued my curiosity. Council member.The fleet operation is under finance so I'll.Answer that question.The that you are exactly right as the funding this is the expenditures related to collections from the departments to buy replacement vehicles for them in FY 14. The amounts of purchases were kept low below the amount that was collected in FY 15.We are proposing that fleet replacements start to catch up with our aging vehicles and have a more normal fleet replacement schedule. So that increase of four is just to get us to our normal replacement level with money collected from the departments.Okay. So if it's.Money collected from the departments, why? Why? Or is that figure that we're seeing on that chart from the departments?Yes, it is revenue. So it's from the different departments. And then what you're seeing is the expenditure of that, an increase of four.Okay. Got it. With that, thank you.Thank you. Councilman Price, would you come back up?Sorry. Mr. GROSS right on that same point. Is it possible for us to get a list of. What specific priorities you and or department heads contemplate in regards to the Fleet Fund?We are. We are. And Councilmember O'Donnell talked about innovation and the whole area of how we replace vehicles and fund vehicles we are looking at from top to bottom. So at present, that is a a holding point for what we know will be a required replacement list.But we are engaging a consultant to help us look at and review which vehicles should be replaced to do it in the most cost effective manner so that we are not replacing vehicles where it is more cost effective to keep them in service a bit longer, and that we are replacing those specific vehicles that are costing usmore money than it's worth keeping. So we are in the process of reviewing that and we can certainly that probably will take several months and we will not be spending that money, but we know that based on our study.But that management partners suggested that that $11 million, which is the total amount for FY 15, is an amount that we will need to spend. We just don't know exactly what vehicles they will be yet.Well, then, is it fair to say that we also aren't ready to spend the money until that study is complete, and that that probably won't be for another 4 to 6 months?It will be shorter than that. And we and so that money will be needed fairly early on in the FY15 cycle because we have to meet when the cars are available, the new models are available, we have to order at that time.So we'll be ready for that.Thank you.Okay. Thank you. Just I just have one comment. Mr. West, also through as far as the health department. I'm really happy to see another one making a lot of changes to adjust to the changes in the Affordable Health Care Act and all the new the new reality of where we are with health care.I just want to make sure that that one we're reinforcing with all of our part time employees at the city what their options are when it comes to the Affordable Care Act. And I just mentioned it because I casually was talking to one of our part time employees who was mostly a Spanish speaking employee who didn't feellike she had the information about what her options were. And so I think the more that we can do to provide all of our our workforce, that particularly the part timers that may not be met may not be getting the medical benefits through the city, as much information about their health options.That would be that would be great. And then second to that, I think that we can do as a city hopefully a lot more moving forward as we partner and promote the Affordable Health Care Act. I think it's in our best interest to get as many Long Beach residents signed up as possible for the long term healthof the entire city. And so if there's ways moving forward that the council and the city can partner to and really begin a larger campaign that's already happening through that through obviously to the federal government and that we can get our our residents signed up.I still find large amounts of people in our city that don't have all the information, particularly those that don't speak English. And so I think we need to do a better job of that, particularly in in different languages.Mayor We've worked very closely with our community partners to holding events throughout the throughout the different times. And we are certainly willing to reach out to our, you know, to our employees and and broader community as we do that.So we are part of a large a large consortium of people, and we'll continue that process.And the work you've done so far has been great. And so I don't take it as a criticism because I think I see the Health Department out there all the time. I see the table and the community worked with the nonprofits.It just I think there's opportunities for us to go beyond that. And hopefully we can we can work together on that. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. So with that, going to turn this over and open it up for public comment on the budget.Please come forward.Hi. My name is Gregory Moore. I am here to speak in favor of one of Mayor Garcia's budget recommendations, and that is a one time $50,000 in matching funds for a marketing plan for the Arts Council for Long Beach.I. I have a pretty good.Lay of the land in Long Beach artistically. I have covered it a lot as a journalist. I'm also a musician and a writer. Long Beach has a tremendously vibrant art scene. It's definitely one of our cultural strengths, but I think, as we all know, Long Beach has never really done a good job establishing itself as a destinationlocation for outlying areas. It's something that we all want to see, and culturally it's one of the things that we can attract. We we have this great scene going. So a marketing sort of a marketing plan developed, good marketing for this would be really helpful.And one of the things I understand that would be would be used, I understand from the new executive director of Victoria Brian.Is would be.For a comprehensive arts calendar something we don't have no publication in Long Beach provides a good arts calendar, something we desperately need not only for outlying areas to be aware of what's going on, but for people within Long Beach, which is a pretty big city, to be aware of what's going on.With their own community. So I haven't got a.Good chance to know this, Brian, yet. I do know Mark Austin, Michael Sugarman, the president of the Arts Council, the city of Long Beach, couldn't have a more a better presence and a better advocate for the arts than Marco.The Arts Council recently released.A.Strategic plan where they did some self analysis. And one of the things that they themselves noted in the past is that they haven't done a great job marketing. That kind of self-awareness, I think, really bodes well for this money being spent to some new strategies to really put Long Beach more on the cultural map.Thanks very much.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Good evening, Bear. Members of the council. My name is for de Castro and I'm a resident of the third district. My address is 616 Grand Avenue. And I'm speaking tonight on behalf of our housing advocates. And I had the pleasure of being at the Budget Oversight Committee that Vice Mayor Susilo Atwal facilitated.And I think tonight as well and last week, just seeing the complexity of the decisions you have in front of you, I'm really I have to say, I'm really impressed with the amount of homework each of you has done and the work that you're doing to really ask critical questions.So really appreciate that. I'm here tonight to urge you to engage us, the community, stakeholders, on the critical issue of housing that is affordable to Long Beach working families. As we heard tonight from Director Kelly Collopy that the city has provided safe and affordable housing to approximately 21,000 residents in 7000 units through housing authority.But we still, as she admitted, there's still a huge gap with regards to housing production. And as all of you know, the Council of Governments instructed the city that we need 4009 new units by, I believe, 2021. So we're still in a housing crisis.And I realize.This is a really, really long road we're on, but we have to begin that journey with one step. So I encourage you to to engage us on this issue. It's been a discouraging, to be honest, that we've been at every budget oversight committee meeting, council budget hearings, sharing testimony, written materials regarding dedicating the boomerang funds for affordablehousing. Yet there has been no council dialog or response to our presence. It's also very significant to have this level of community involvement, as you can imagine, this complex time to have residents provide their testimony, either, you know, their personal stories on this issue.So there's been a lot of community engagement on it. I also want to share I facilitated back in 2005 actually for the department Health and Human Services, the ten year plan to end homelessness. And there were five key elements that we identified back then.And the first is, and I'll just mention it right here, the first finding was how the housing goal was increase the number of homes that homeless and low income people can afford. So I think Director.Colby is doing a great job of helping to meet that need. But we again, we.Need new housing production and let's let's begin that journey and let's work critically together. Thank you.Thank you. Speaker, please.Good evening, Mayor and City Council. My name is Carrie Gallagher. I'm the executive director of housing Long Beach, and my information is on file. You know, last.Week, 100 people came out to the city council meeting and stayed very late to show their.Support for the use of boomerang funds for housing. 35 people were there at the Budget Oversight Committee tonight, and even 20 people have stayed linked to the night as well tonight to show their support. And we're here especially tonight to address housing as an issue of health and as an issue of infrastructure health.It's a pretty simple connection, right? I mean, the health department does an excellent job at addressing homelessness, but.We do not prevent homelessness until we actually make sure that people have affordable homes in which to live.And as it relates to infrastructure, you know.We don't get homeless people off the streets by building more streets. We get homeless people.Off the streets by building more homes.And so I want to make it very clear, since so many people have asked, well, if we, you know, put the boomerang funds towards housing.Or a percentage of the funds, where will the money come from? And so we are proposing tonight that infrastructure is the first place.Where the money should be realigned and rebalanced to represent the full.Extent of community infrastructure with.Housing as one of those basic building blocks of community infrastructure. So for those of you who are not at the Budget.Oversight Committee tonight, like Mr. Ranga, thank you for your.Question. I will give you a quick recap.We were very grateful to see the agenda item or to see boomerang funds. Finally, agendas. But unfortunately, because of time constraints, the many speakers were only given one minute to.Speak and council made absolutely no comments before receiving and filing.The recommendation.So we recognize again, we were on time constraints, but we are here again and we will keep coming to urge you to take this behind the.Rail and please have a meaningful discussion about housing and the boomerang funds.I'd like to spend the rest of my time reacting to the staff report that was given to the Budget Oversight Committee and CC Blanc, a carbon copy to the City Council.Around the Boomerang funds. This report paints an.Inaccurate and misleading.Picture of housing resources available for housing creation in Long Beach, and it diverts the conversation from addressing the topic at hand. Now the eight page report made an extensive list of different resources available in regards to housing, but.Unfortunately it does not actually.Address the question of creating a.Permanent new local revenue source. Many of the funds.That were identified, over 9.Million were home and call home dollars, which do not create new.Housing at all. These are rehabilitation and homebuyer assistance programs. Other monies that were identified were debt obligations that are legally required to be spent, such as the 24.7 million from the mayor's proposals, and the rest are state and.Federal dollars available only to developers, not to the.City. And though these are resources, this is not addressing the actual need for funds. Lastly, the.Report was discouraging because it seemed to assess that we're doing more.Than enough for housing.And we cannot have a meaningful discussion with you around housing until we actually admit that.There is a housing crisis.And so we hope that we will move forward. This discussion tonight that you will address the issue of boomerang funds behind the rail, and we urge you to support the.Commitment of these funds for housing. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Hello, counsel. My name is Ben Fisher. I'm a resident of the First District. I'm here to let you know. I personally attended multiple community meetings on the housing element, multiple planning, commission meetings, council meetings, budget meetings, budget committee meetings, and frankly, my opinion.Yet nothing has been done around funding new housing stock. Nor do I feel the community input process around housing has been sincere or impactful. This is set to be the fourth year without any new city funding for housing.Please do not be fooled by the recent report touting state bills or some of the other things I've seen touting things coming from housing, rental assistance from the federal government. This is said to be the fourth consecutive year, despite needing to produce 4000 new affordable units by 2021.We've been asking that 20% of the funds returned to the city go to housing, and many of you in your actual campaigns have said that housing is a priority issue and even specifically mentioned that 20% of boomerang funds should go to housing.The funds would not create a deficit, but it would redirect existing funds. So I have a question for all of you. Do you feel you have the power to shape a budget someone else created, which is pending your approval?If your answer is no, then what is a function of your approval? What is your role in this process? Assuming there is no political will to move the funds around. And if you guys want to have a meaningful dialog about where those funds would come from, we would love to have that conversation.I ask that you please make sure that during your tenure you do not allow a fifth year to go by without any new city funds for housing. If you feel that you do have the power to shape a budget someone else created, then please take time to evaluate where housing is in the infrastructure, safety and health prioritiesof your constituents. I particularly emphasize this for those of you who spoke of housing as a priority during your campaigns. If housing is a priority to you and those elected to you, it should be prioritized in any budget that you approve.Someone once asked me after the seat took on none of the community and housing element. Why is it so hard? I answered, Because it's the most important element, the biggest part of people's budgets. So if it's the biggest boat to turn around, it'd be easier to just let it be.Don't be a council that lets the big important choices continue floating on into the sunset. Roll up your sleeves and turn it toward your constituents voices. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker.Good evening, Mr. Mayor and council members. My name is Gloria Rivera, resident of the second District and a community organizer with Housing in Long Beach. We are here before you yet again today to talk about boomerang funds because it was advised by the city council during the housing element last year that we bring it to the budgetand talk about it within the context of the budget. We came today during the Budget Oversight Committee hearing, and as you heard before, not only was our time cut down to one minute, but there was absolutely no discussion behind the rail about this.So what good is coming to the budget hearings if there's not going to be a healthy, vibrant, robust discussion about this housing crisis and its need? Recently, we have heard from you, Mr. Mayor, that the next big issue city leadership is going to be tackling is affordable homes.But before we talk about building new homes, we have to talk about where the local, permanent local source of funding is going to be coming from. The community continues to present themselves in support of remedying this housing crisis.Just think about what this would mean to the community and to the members, which you all serve. It would allow us to to as a city, to leverage other resources everywhere to help foster safer and healthier community and neighborhoods.More importantly, it would demonstrate your commitment to the well-being of your community and your city. It will set a higher standard of leadership for the region, and it will establish trust through your support of the community's needs. On the other hand, imagine what happens if we don't allow boomerang funds or locate any kind of local source offunding. Are you willing to be the one to say to a homeless vets, Sorry, you can't find an affordable place to live or to a single mother? Sorry, you have to decide between paying rent or your medical child's expenses.You know. Sorry. I understand that this is a hard decision to make. I understand that this is politically challenging. I understand that these funds have supposedly been allocated within the budget. But when you do what I do and you hear these stories day in and day out, you know what?It's not that hard of a decision because you see firsthand how this will affect thousands of lives in Long Beach. We recognize the resources that the staff has discussed in the memo, but they are not new. They are not local and they are not permanent.And if not boomerang funds, then what funding are we allocating? And if not in this budget, then when we have heard over and over again that now is not the time, how far down the road are you willing to kick this can?This is an issue of health, of public safety and an overall benefit to the community. So if the question is where do we pull the funds as it has been, then pull it from infrastructure because it's a benefit to the overall community.The time is now to show your leadership and to show your commitment of service to the people of Long Beach. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please. Just to make sure I'm unless there's another speaker who's going to line up, I'm cutting off the speaker's list. If you haven't, unless you want that, please line up, sir. Okay. So that gentleman will be the last person on the speaker's list, please.Honorable Mayor Councilmembers.Dave Sterling.With the IAM and as many of.You already have expressed.Tonight, I'd like to express our support on behalf of the roughly 3500 employees within the city that we represent for the mayor's budget recommendation of stopping the pursuit of outsourcing, street sweeping, but rather searching in word inside the operation to find efficiencies and cost savings or at the same time maintaining the high standard of service that existscurrently. The idea of city management partnering with our members, the city employees who perform the work. On a day to day basis makes sense, and it should serve as a model for other operations as well rather than than outsourcing.Look at ways to make current operations better, more cost effective. The employees who perform these services, many of them live here in the city, and they.Take ownership and pride in the work they.Do. And that's something you won't find by excising an operation and outsourcing it. And if the charge truly was to find cost savings and efficiencies, it's my hope. Management partners would have found this solution long ago, as we already could have been saving the amount of money that we hope it will.Thank you.Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.Hello. Good evening. My name? Gigi Fusco. Ms.. I am a proud member of the Arts Council for Long Beach Board of Directors, and I'm here to speak about the one time allocation that's in the budget proposed for for our organization.It's a great group, the Arts Council of Long Beach. We are very committed to the arts, the artists and all the art performing arts, visual art groups here in our amazing community. They bring they bring up the raise the quality of life for all of us.They feed our souls, and they're also big employers in town as well. If approved for this money, it will help in our strategic plan and mission to make Long Beach a number one artistic destination, arts destination in the state of California.And I think it's real easy to do. We are so lucky. I love Long Beach. You don't have to leave the city limits to find anything you want. We have the Long Beach. We have a symphony, opera, ballet, the Long Beach Playhouse, Musical Theater West, the Found Art Exchange, the Expo Building.We have so many wonderful organizations which time will not allow me to list them all here tonight. So don't get mad at me, guys. We have so many wonderful things. What a lucky group of elected officials you are that you have these treasures in your town, in your own districts.We went out and talked to them and we found that they really need our support. They have weathered the financial downturn. They are still here. A lot of organizations, museums, performing arts groups, they have not weathered the storm as well.And they need our support. We need to see them thrive and grow. We need to see them bringing in new people into town and also providing all the wonderful educational programs that they have. We need to let people know that they exist and they need to be supported.I know this firsthand. I ran the Long Beach Playhouse for many years and worked with musical Theater West and it's really great to see the faces of people who come to Long Beach for the first time to see an exhibit or a show.And that is not just something that's fun and to to feed our soul, but it drives the economic engine of our community. When you go out for dinner, for a show and dinner or to go see an exhibit, you're employing a babysitter or a parking attendant, you know, waitstaff, restaurateurs and maybe a bartender or two.That being said, this money will help us really shine a light on the arts in this amazing community, drive tourism and let our residents know about all the wonderful assets that they have. They don't have to leave the city limit at all.Long Beach is the best place for arts. We need everybody now. Thank you.Thank you so much. Next speaker, please.Oh, hello. I'm Joe Weinstein. Eighth District of the Community Budget Book encourages citizens to come out and say, what are the services that matter to them? And so that encourages the kind of special pleading you have heard tonight.And we'll hear more of I'm not here for that. I'm not here to endorse or oppose a specific recommendation for this budget. I would like to point out that those of us who would like to take a broad picture rather than advocate for one program and expand one program, and if the money somehow won't have to comefrom somewhere else, I'm here to advocate for those of us who are ready to make trade offs. If only we had the information to suggest those tradeoffs four years ago and more. The budget, as posted in its papers, provided a certain basic amount of information to allow you to cast out specific services and therefore compare their costsand therefore decide maybe you would like more of this and less of that. The one signal example that I have seen tonight and I commend I commend that example is the Water Department's presentation, which showed us the difference in costs between MWD and WMD or WMD.At any rate, that enables you.To make a comparison, enables you to make policies that don't call for increasing funds, but says, Gee, we ought to shift things a little bit if we only can. Well, we don't have such guidance in the budget ever since four years ago, even recommendations that I made based on cost comparisons and another occasion of ordinary trash collectionversus straight sweeping, they were based on cost that I could assemble only from the budget of four years ago and more. Because you have given because the budget's given the citizens no real tools to suggest rational alternatives, and they apparently give yourselves behind the rail.No more such tools either. I find it very difficult to participate any further in this kind of so-called budget process. So I suggest that if you really are serious about crafting a budget, give yourself more time between the first public unveiling and the time you've got to pass a budget.And second of all, make sure that that budget document once again breaks out unit costs for specific services. Thank you.Thank you, Joe. Joe, you will be happy next year where we're looking at some new budget software and the end also is restructuring the process a bit to make it much more open and interactive. And there's some great stuff happening out there with some open government budget software and some of the process, participatory government stuff that's happening, budget stuff that's happening in some of the districts. And that's all going to come together next year in a new way. So I think you'll you'll be back here, I hope, saying that you look forward to it.Okay, great. Please. Hi.My name is Kathleen Irvine. I am the president of Whitmore City Heritage Association. And first of all, I want to thank the mayor and the council members, because I have no idea how with a part time job, you are able to take care of this budget oversight and take care of your districts.So thank you very much for everything that you guys do. I really, really appreciate it. I came here basically to thank the mayor for his recommendation to put in a preservation planner into the budget. I understand that it's not supposed to cost any more money, but I want to emphasize how important it is to our districts.We have 17 historic districts. It is not just about paint, color or fence heights. Historic districts are wonderful because they speak to the character of our city, the craftsmanship of the people who lived here. It is a sustainable solution.New buildings are always less sustainable than repairing old buildings. So I just want to thank the mayor for his suggestion. And please all of you support this suggestion for a preservation planner. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Hi. My name is Jim Darrow. I'm also with Willmar City Heritage. How do I follow that? That's exactly what I'm here to say. Thank you for suggesting the preservation planner. It helps with the integrity of the or the historical historical integrity of our neighborhoods.Really quick, also, I want to thank public works. I wish all departments in the city were run as well as you guys. You guys have always been there for every call we've had regarding everything from new parks, helping us with planners and such as well as street sweeping.So thank you very, very much. You outstanding. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker.Please. Hi. My name is Jenny Searson. I, too, live in Wilmore City. I just wanted to thank you, Mayor Garcia, for coming through on your campaign promise of supporting preservation in our historic districts.And I love the Long Beach.Next speaker, please.Good evening. My name is Michelle Dobson. I'm a third district resident, grew up in the seventh District and my business is in the fourth. So I am here tonight to speak on behalf of the Arts Council and the Arts Council Board of Directors and the Board of Directors members and and the staff.I am in my final third year term, final three year term, so that's nine years total on the Arts Council. During my first three year term on the Arts Council, our meetings were at the ungodly hour of 730 in.The morning at Bixby knows, but we had 45 people at those meetings, including a staff member from each of the council districts, a member from the mayor's office, a staff member from Economic Development, a representative from the cannabis office, and a representative from the police department.Those meetings were full. Everyone was a participant and everyone had a buy in to the Arts Council. What we were trying to do. I'm not an artist. I'm not a photographer, a singer, a writer, a director, a Delson, an actor, a professor of art.I do none of those things. Nonetheless, our board has that level of diversity where we have arts professionals alongside accountants, college professors, lawyers and marketing professionals, each with a full buy into the new strategic plan. So I urge you to adopt the recommendation for funding to implement that strategic plan.When I was interviewed as an Arts Council board member for the Strategic Plan, I reiterated why I have served three three year terms as an Arts Council Board of Directors member. I expressed to the Strategic Planning Committee that it continues to be a priority for the Arts Council, that we increase our engagement, our presence at arts events, and providing marketing support for arts organizations in all districts in the city. Full engagement from west of the Los Angeles River. The Los Angeles River, which we call the flood control. If you grew up here to north the area around Jordan to Long Beach Poly, which we call the east side, when I was growing up because Ididn't know there was anything further east in Pali and to the true east of Long Beach over by Eldorado Park. It turns out that other Arts Council board of directors, members and stakeholders had the same ideas about what they desired for the Arts Council.That we become engaged in all nine Council districts and we make everyone aware of the events that are going on within walking distance of their homes. We recently partnered with and co-sponsored a joint skateboarding BMX art event where we featured skateboarding and BMX artists.We had a second event where we set up a mobile gallery at the Long Beach Formula Drift Racing event and featured Long Beach, Long Beach artists. We also partnered with Stuart Ashman at Miller, Chris Stokes at the University Art Museum and Michele Roberts at the Carpenter Center.So they would show each of these artists works and would also give free entry to their families so their families could come and see what they were doing. The implementation of the Arts Council Strategic Plan will bring us right back to where we were, where we're asking you to partner with us, assign a staff member to cometo our meetings and be a part of each one of our meetings and help us implement the strategic plan.Thank you so much. Next speaker, please.Hello, everyone. My name is Aaron James Lawrence LeMay. I'm new to Long Beach. I've been here about six months now for those months out of the six, I've been on hiatus, so I really haven't been involved when it comes to making money for my living in Long Beach, but I have spent from my living here, I liveat the sovereign across the street and I notice actually called the previous mayor when I saw the advertisement for the up and coming mayors. It should be noted with the assistant that was there, I called and I said Hi, I'm curious about running for mayor and the assistant transfer me to the person taking care of the currentmayor and then said he's already endorsed him. I said, Were there any other positions available in the city? It's a true story. I was at the Newport Beach AT&T store, where I was account consultant for a year and a half with businesses in and around Irvine and Newport Beach.Before that, for about 15 years I was an entertainer and I took myself.To I just want to make sure this is budget.This is this is budget related. This is well, I reviewed my budget. I came in tonight because your door was open and I literally just got off the train from going to Universal Studios today where I was visiting lots of friends.So budgets are everywhere. The reason why I felt compelled to speak to this budget matter and to all of these issues, I'm deciding whether or not to stay in Long Beach for my own personal housing. If that issue didn't come up tonight, I wouldn't.It came up a lot. So I came to throw my personal voice instead of everyone else with budgets and studies and paperwork's in there pledging everything. I'm just giving you a personal perspective, saying that I'm deciding whether to move myself to North Hollywood or other places that I can be involved in arts.Because I studied I lived in Japan for a year and a half. So I know a lot about technological homes and living and working in Japan. There is technology where I could take a card and it's still there.At the Shinkansen station I would get off and I'd go to my home and I'd put a card in and the electricity would turn off. When I would take that card out to leave, the only way I could get in is by tapping it, getting in, putting that in the slot, and then the electricity would come up. So I know that you guys are going to do everything that you're going to do to study to make sure that Long Beach does the best it can do. I just wanted to throw my name in the hat and say, I hope that the decision.That everyone makes to make the city better entertainment wise and bringing in consistent revenue for everybody. I hope it keeps me here. You know, I'll be around. My name's they. Call me A.J..Thank you, A.J.. Hope you stay in Long Beach. Okay. Thank you. That was. Thank you for the attorney for the the budget hearing. With that, I need to take a motion to table the discussion to the next budget hearing.Second.There is a motion and a second on the floor. All those in favor say to table it. Okay. Budget hearing tabled. And from there we're going to move on to consent calendar. Kate in a second I was in favor say, okay, we're going to turn that over now to the item that Mr. Mayor.\nSummary:", "answer": "Recommendation to conduct a Budget Hearing to receive and discuss an Overview of the Proposed Fiscal Year 2015 Budget for the following: Department of Health and Human Services, Public Works Department, and Water Department."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nI. Madam Secretary, closed the voting and announced the results. 13/8 13 ies council 20 20637 has passed. Councilmember Ortega, would you please put Council Bill 20 2-0694 on the floor for final passage?Madam President, I move that council bill 20 2-0694 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.It has been moved and seconded. The required public hearing for Council Bill 20 20694 is open. May we have the staff report?Good afternoon.Members of council. My name is Jump Benefit Senior City Planning Planner with Cabinet Planning and Development. And today I'm going to present your rezoning for 51 to 1 lead. Still drive. The applicant is requesting to resign from duty for 36 to EP to be.The proposed rezoning is located in Council District five, which is some of the district. And it is a vacant lot in the Washington, Virginia built neighborhood. The property owner of Standard Lutheran Church of Denver, Habitat for Humanity of Metro Denver, are proposing to rezone part of their property from B2 436 to E2, which would allow for thedevelopment of four duplexes that they intend to sell to households making up or below 80% of the area. Median income. The proposals are given it to unit based on district allows for the urban House, detached accessory dwelling units, duplex and tandem housebuilding forms.I would like to quickly note here that while the others for the site is leads still drive, the main access to the property is on Dakota Avenue and in Fairfax Street. The next slides will illustrate better this linear axis on leaves still drag.You can see it there. The current zoning of the subject side is beauty. 436. The beauty was adopted in 1997 and applies to whole parcel as shown on the map. It was intended to allow for the construction of a single building with 66 units for a special care home for senior citizens.It allows a maximum height for a building of up to 35 feet. The facility was supposed to be an extension of the ministry of our Standard Lutheran Church, but financing was not secured and the special care home was never developed.The duty also allows for the development of uses allowed in R-1 district, which is a predominantly single unit district in former Chapter 59. The existing land use on the site is vacant. It's surrounded by mostly public possible uses where the church is to a north west single unit, residential uses to the north, northeast and east, and commercialretail uses doing so while the subject site is currently vacant. The portion of the solar that is not being resolved is currently being used as an informal open space and vegetable garden. This slide shows the existing context surrounding the subject site.With the proposed rezoning site on the top right on the bottom right image. You can see the commercial uses just south of the site on Lidl, on the top right image, the existing informal open space and vegetable garden located just west of the subject site.Throughout the rezoning process, application notifications have been provided according to Code Requirements. Planning Board recommended approval anonymously on May 18. Since the staff report was published, we have received two letters of support one from the preservation of residential South Hilltop Neighborhood Association and one from a community member.Stuff also received one letter in opposition to a rezoning that expresses concerns with increased traffic and density. As you'll know, there's five review criteria when analyzing the appropriateness of the request. The first criterion is consistency with adopted plans.There are two plans applicable to his rezoning. We have comprehensive plan 2040 and we have a blueprint under. The rezoning is consistent with several of the strategies in the comprehensive plan and they can be found on the staff report.Now looking at live in Denver, the future neighborhood context is urban edge. Within this context, we find a range of uses from single unit and multi-unit residential to commercial corridors and centers. As the rezoning would allow a variety of building forms in an urban setting, the proposed district is appropriate and consistent with the blueprint.Denver Context Description. The future place of this area is called Community Corridor, which typically provides some mix of offices, commercial and residential. And heights generally go up to five stories. Dakota Avenue and Fairfax Street are designated as local or un designated streets, and little is classified as a commercial ideal arterial future street type.The proposed E2 district is consistent with this description because it is a residential district that allows for a single unit and two unit uses and is intended to promote existing and future patterns of lower skilled multi-unit building forms.The subject property is located within the community centers and corridor's growth area. These areas are expected to see 20% of new employment growth and 25% of new housing growth by 2040. The proposed rezoning is consistent with the growth strategy map in this area.Blueprint also has policy language around rezoning properties from the former. Chapter 59 Zoning Code and out of customs zoning such as the site plan specific conditions on the subject property. Therefore, it still finds that this proposed rezoning is consistent with urban Denver.Stuff also finds that the requested zoning meets the next two criteria. The rezoning will result in uniformity of district regulations, and it will further the public health, safety and welfare of the city, primarily through its implementation of adopted plans and through improving design standards.Additionally, rezoning out a portion of 5436 will not have a negative impact on the remaining of the site and development under the current, but would still be possible. The rezoning would bring this property from former Chapter 59 Soni into the Denver zoning code.Such a change is listed in the zoning code as an appropriate, justified circumstance. Lastly, staff finds that the proposed rezoning is consistent with the Sound District purpose and intent of the E2 based on district. Based on the review criteria does recommend approval based on finding or review criteria has been met.Thank you. We have six individuals signed up to speak on this this evening. We will begin with Michael Sumwalt. If you can re-introduce yourself when you come up. Thank you.Yes. Hello. My name is Michael Dumont, a resident of Highlands Ranch, Colorado. And my daughter and I have been members of August and a Lutheran church for over five years now. So thank you for this opportunity to appear before you in favor of this of this proposal.For the past two years, I've been serving as the president of the coronation and chairperson of our church as governing body or counsel. It's a privilege to stand here before you as a representative of my church, which is overwhelmingly shown its support for this initiative involving our undeveloped property, to hopefully be used in a very small wayto help alleviate the challenges to affordable housing that our city of Denver has been facing for some time now. In our partnership with Habitat for Humanity of Metro Denver, we feel strongly that we can contribute to making progress in this area of need.And as an added benefit, they have helped us build an even stronger relationship with our community through this initiative that we believe will be a benefit to everyone involved along with our church. This effort is greatly supported by our local councilwoman, Mansoor Sawyer, the South Hilltop Neighborhood Association, which represents the neighborhood just east of our church andseveral of our closest neighbors. One of them actually has their house backing up to the lot that we are hoping to develop. So as a member and representative of the Augustine Lutheran Church, I ask for your support, this rezoning effort to help alleviate the need for affordable housing.Thank you.Thank you. Our next speaker in chambers is Scott Kilgore.Hello. My name is Scott Kilgour. I live at 435 South Fourth Street, just around the corner from the subject property. I'm a board member of the Preservation of Residential South Hilltop Neighborhood Association, and I'm here tonight to speak on behalf of the R.A. and reiterate our support of this rezoning request as outlined in our letter of support. We feel that the current party zoning is not compatible with the neighborhood context and that the proposed zoning district will result in a building Forman scale that is much more similar to the surrounding homes. While allowing for a gentle increase in density, the proposed development will add new homes and amenity rich central neighborhood while cleaning up anunderused personal property, fixing existing drainage issues at the site. We are excited that these for sale homes will be offered to buyers under 80%. AMI and the applicant team has proven a willingness to collaborate with our neighborhood. We've had multiple points of engagement with them and they've been very responsive to our feedback.We do not have a good neighbor agreement in place with this rezoning, but we feel confident that the applicant team will continue to engage with the neighborhood and be responsive to us. They've already agreed to a number of things in writing, as described in our letter of support.This rezoning request only impacts the 51 to 1 sale parcel that faces Dakota and Fairfax and Augustana Lutheran Church. And the applicant team has reiterated to the neighborhood multiple times that the remaining piece of the parcel will continue to be used as a park and that that will stay.Discussion among our members and board has been overall very positive on the rezoning. We had eight board members vote in favor of supporting this rezoning, a zero voted opposed and one member that abstained due to the lack of response when voting electronically due to COVID.So yes, the preservation of residential South Hilltop Neighborhood Neighborhood Association urges City Council to support this rezoning request. Thank you.Thank you.Ann Hultquist.Hi. I'm in Hillcrest on the senior pastor at Augustana Lutheran Church. I've been there for six years and I'm also a resident of Denver. In 2018, our congregation began to have this dream together, knowing that we own this piece of very vacant, dilapidated property and hearing from the Interfaith Alliance at the time about the ways they wereencouraging many different faith communities throughout the metro area to continue to consider building affordable housing. Interfaith Alliance helped us begin to give shape to the dream of serving our community and neighbors in this very concrete way, using our property and our resources.We've been privileged to partner with Habitat for Humanity Metro Denver. As the project has moved from dream to close to reality. We've also been privileged to receive support from the South Hilltop Neighborhood Association, as you hear and from Council Representative Sawyer, Augustine is a congregation that is firmly planted in our Denver area.We've been at our present location in Hilltop since 1958. Our core values are worship, grow and grow, and that last word go means to us that we are not turned in on ourselves, but that the purpose of being a faith community is to turn outward to see what we can do to make the world a better place. We have a number of outreach ministries that connect us to our neighborhood in the metro area, but we're so excited to imagine these townhomes, the neighbors who will live there and the way that we can play a part, a small part of bringing decent, affordable housing to people who will call our neighborhood home or call as afaith community is to love and serve. And this is a wonderful way for us to be able to fulfill that call. I urge the Council to support this rezoning.Thank you. Thank you.Kim. Sarah.Good evening, members of City Council. My name is Sarah and I reside near this location and I'm here tonight to support this zoning. I have been so impressed by the work between the community Habitat and Augustana. It's a great model to see people really welcoming affordable housing in our neighborhood.It's a great neighborhood with wonderful schools, beautiful parks, transit, and it's the perfect place for affordable housing. This also meets the criteria for a rezoning, and I'm hopeful you will support this evening. Thank you.Thank you. Corey Whittaker.Good evening, counsel. My name's Corey Whittaker and I live in Lakewood and I lead the real estate team with Habitat for Humanity, Metro Denver. I'm going to talk a little bit tonight about our application to Arizona. So back in 2009, Habitat from the partnership with Augustine Lutheran Church to execute the vision that you've heard of using someof their property to address that critical need for affordable homeownership in Denver. The rezoning request before you tonight is one step in making that vision a reality. Going to talk a little bit about how we arrived at that zoning designation that we're asking for and how it meets the approval criteria.Habitat approaches all of its developments. Balancing three things. We balance affordability, which is key to what Habitat does, and it's key to our mission livability. This really speaks to creating a functional and successful development for those who are living in it and neighborhood context.We want to respect and we want to respond to the surrounding character habitat in August and are proposing to rezone a portion of the property from PUD to E2 B to develop four duplexes for a total of eight homes that you zoned district are a two unit allowance for that duplex building form, which fits that urban edgecontext that this area is in and it's a more efficient building type to build. So one step in helping us make these homes more affordable. These homes will be three and four bedrooms in size with one dedicated off street parking space per home, as well as one reserved space and the adjacent Augusta in a parking lot.The additional space per home is being provided by Augusta to help alleviate some of the concerns from the neighborhood, from the neighbors about an increase in street parking along Dakota. The homes will also respond to the surrounding context by being two stories in height with pitched roofs and a mixture of siding materials.As part of our continued dialog with the R.A., Abbott has agreed to bring the building design to the R.A. for comment prior to submitting for permit. The rezoning request also meets all the required criteria, including aligning with the goals of the 2040 comprehensive plan, such as develop housing that is affordable to residents at all income levels.Goals and Blueprint Number 2019, such as expanding family friendly housing throughout the city. And it is consistent with the urban engineering context as outlined in Blueprint Number. I would like to thank Augustana for having this vision. I would like to thank the R.A. for being receptive and supportive of this project, and I would urge you to approvethis rezoning. Affordable homeownership is a critical need in Denver, and this development is one small step in addressing many.Thank you. Thank you. We'll move to our Zoom platform for Heather Lafferty. Heather, if you would accept the promotion, we can bring you into the panel.Well, greetings, city council members. Thank you for allowing me to join this evening virtually. My name is Heather Lafferty and I live in Denver's first district. And I'm speaking tonight on behalf of Habitat for Humanity of Metro Denver and our project proposal in partnership with Augustana Lutheran Church.I know many of you have worked with Habitat or certainly familiar with our work. We have built and repaired hundreds of homes across the metro Denver area. I should say across Denver. And we continue to seek opportunities to be innovative, to find new ways to find land and to build homes so that more and more people havethe opportunity to have a good, safe, decent and affordable place to call home. Habitat supports and advocates for policies that expand our housing affordability. And just want to take a moment to applaud City Council for the work that you have done in this arena.We appreciate that you are trying to find ways to help address the lack of affordable housing and support for this rezoning. Tonight is one step towards that. Not only do we think this is a great project, we think that it is a unique collaboration between a church, a neighborhood, and a nonprofit developer like Habitat to find newways to create the most needed, much needed affordable housing in our community. So we hope this will serve as a model. And many of the speakers before me have talked about all of the benefits of this. So I won't repeat those, but just want to take the opportunity to say this is exactly what we need in ourcommunity. We're grateful for the community support. We're grateful for the the imagination that the congregation at the church has and certainly for our city council's support as we have put this forward. Encouraging quality, infill development that's consistent with neighborhoods like the Hilltop area is a great way to get housing accomplished.So thank you for considering this rezoning tonight. And I do urge you, we always would love a unanimous yes. In support of this project. Thank you so much for your time and for your consideration.Thank you. That concludes our speakers questions for members and from of counsel and council. Bill 20 2-069 for Councilwoman Ortega.Thank you, Madam President. Libby, I wanted to ask you a couple of questions. First. It looks like excess of the lead steel is primarily off of Dakota, is that correct?Yes.Okay. And is there any other access to the remaining part of the land off of lead steel, or will there be access off of Dakota because it looks like only part of the pad is being resolved. Right.Yeah. So the I can show you a slide if it helps. But there is there's a street. It has a lot of it's very steep. And that's the connection that comes from lead steel. So it's like a it's a dirt road right now.So there's going to be no connection there. My instinct is that when the dude like back in 97 when they did that project that was planned to be like the connection to lead still not anymore. Like the access now is going to be.And you can see it here. I have an image that shows where the is. So here you can see the corner. So it's this image on the right. So you can see that it's like direct access to the townhouses is going to be there.Okay.Can I just jump in for a minute to answer that question as well? So the the access from lead steel, it's only about an 11 feet wide. It's a very weird shaped parcel. It looks that way. Right. Exactly.And and it's an incredibly steep hill. So there's and with the drainage challenges and the infrastructure that would have to be built out. There is no way to to make it make an entrance or an exit up that hill.It has a lot to do with like flooding, water flow and stuff like that. I could get really nerdy on you, but I'll spare you. So the back. So the entrance is going to be on Dakota and Fairfax, which right now is just an ELL that ends in this empty parcel.And then the Augusta in a parking lot is right there.So access is then partially on this site or adjacent to it. So we're not just trying to understand that. I see my colleague has a map right now of the of the property looking at it.Corey, I don't know if you have any info on this as well.Because part of the reason for asking the question is it looks like at some point the the remainder of the vacant land can be available for development, but access to it seems very limited from Leeds Steel and then the access from Florida sorry to Florida Dakota.So prior to prior to something for the rezoning we submitted for concept plan and we worked with Daddy specifically on the corner of Dakota and Fairfax. And Daddy approved kind of a T intersection right there for a future entrance onto the property.So if the pad was ever to be developed, there is an entrance from Dakota and Fairfax County that.Okay. I see it on this graphic. Thank you, Libby. And if you get this back, happy to give it back to you. So I want you to just ask a couple of questions about how many units can be on the site.So I think the plan calls for units. And again, we keep it. So it's so duplex. We see it.It's okay. And then. So I think we clarified the questions of Dakota. So I think that's all I have. So I appreciate you helping me understand what that access looks like and the fact that there will continue to be opportunity for development of the remainder of the site.So thank you.Thank you. Councilmember PANITCH.Thank you so much. You probably said this and I missed it, but I didn't see it in the PowerPoint when I went back to look. So I'm really excited about the affordability. Is there agreement with hosts to do this as an alternative or they will just satisfy the ordinance at the time?How are how are we dealing with the current and or future ordinances that will be in effect when they pull the building permit?So there's no agreement. I mean. Habitat is doing 100% affordable housing. That's because they're working with the church and they own it. But there's no good neighbor agreement. There's no.Yeah, yeah.So so 100% affordable homes are exempt from the ordinance. So you're just are you playing do you want to just answer? Are you planning to just state that exemption at the time of building permit? Okay. For the record, there's a nod from the back room.Thank you. That's it.Thank you, Councilman Flynn.Thank you, Madam President. Fran, I'm curious to follow up on Councilwoman Ortega's questions, being a math geek myself. What is the purpose of the remnant that runs along the south side of this parcel rezoning? Because it seems to me it would have no utility at all.As Councilwoman Sawyer pointed out, it's a steep hill, but it's still part of the Peabody, but it looks a dead ends at a private property line, so it looks like it has no independent utility at all. Why would that not be included in the in the rezoning?Honestly, we have the same question. A planning board. So it's good. I'm noticing that it's very steep, as you say, it's very steep. It's not really developable. The applicant proposes an area that they want to develop, and that's the area like when you got we talked about like redeveloping the whole site.We talked about going all the way to south, but it didn't make sense because they just that's the area that they wanted to build the townhouses. And we looked at it and because it's so steep in the south, we figured it doesn't really matter.So the boat on the south is going to stay part of the rest of the beauty.Could would someone from the church be able to answer what future plan for the rest of the PD might incorporate that little strip? Is there? Do we have an outlook for development of the rest of the property because it still is under the old PD that that is very, very highly specific and particular it is.So when we when we looked at the property, there is a very steep slope, I think it's about 20 feet that stretches along the further than the portion that we are rezoning. So when we looked at what we needed to rezone, the parcel of land worked without including that.And since that feature kind of ran along the entire property, we felt like it was best to exclude it from what we were rezoning because at some future time they might be able to to redevelop that entire property.Now, I don't want to speak for behalf of the church, but currently the property is a park. It is a privately owned park, but it is open to the public and the church has no intention of changing that.Use anything. All right. Thank you, gentlemen.Okay. Um. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council. Members of Council and Council Bill 20 20694 Council Member Sawyer.Thanks, Madam President. I just want to thank you guys so much. This is. It's so exciting. I'm so glad we're finally here. The first meeting that we had, or maybe was the second meeting before they filed their application was like three days before the COVID shutdown, and it looked like maybe this wasn't going to be able tohappen after all. And there was a lot of challenges. The original hope on the site was to be able to build 20 units. And because of that, because of that crazy slope, it just can't be done. But there would be there would have to be retaining walls built in drainage.And like I said, I can infrastructure nerd out about it for you guys, but you don't need to hear the whole story. It's a shame that it is that it is exactly that way because it is a fantastic plan.It is a fantastic location. And I wish you guys would have mentioned, but you didn't. So the Congregation of Augustana Church actually voted on what to do with the land and what and this is what they voted on.They wanted to develop this parcel to support families of middle income earners in our community. And I don't know how many of you are aware, but others stand to have the most incredible after school program and preschool programs.And so most of the community members around the hilltop and south to help them across more areas have been in and out of Augusta on at least 100 million times with their young kids. And so this is a really exciting opportunity for the community.It is consistent with the adopted plans. Absolutely. And fits all of the criteria. And I just want to acknowledge the the neighborhood association, they have been so wonderful and supportive. Of course, there are residents who had questions and concerns and they were wonderful about going out, setting up Zoom meetings, asking questions and just really getting in backand forth with Habitat and with Augustana to see, you know, where those pain point issues were so that they could be worked out ahead of time. Just really, really excited. I think for those of you who might have missed it, this is it could have been a 63 unit senior development.And so it's a down zoning and that that sort of left hand section on the map that you saw where there is kind of nothing there, it looks like there's nothing there. But what's actually there is the most extraordinary, you know, park and community garden, an area that is open to the public even though it's private land. Augustana has been just extraordinary partners to the community for many, many, many years. And I don't know if you can tell, but I am super excited for this so I can support it strongly enough. I am so grateful for your partnership and for Habitat's partnership and for all that you guys have done.And I just I'm so glad we're here tonight and so thrilled to get started. So let me know when we need some volunteers to get building for Habitat, because I cannot wait. I'm really, really thrilled that this is just going to be such a wonderful thing for our community.Thanks.Thank you, Madam Secretary.

Colleagues dutifully remember this last August when we had a chance to celebrate the retirement of Chris Curtis, who's the founder of the Neighborhood Farmers Market Alliance. In the early nineties, Chris got together with some neighbors and friends and about 15 different farmers and decided that they wanted to find a way to allow those farmers to selldirectly to the public. They sold their produce to 800 shoppers on their first day in 1993, and now the neighborhood Farmer's Market Alliance runs seven outdoor markets, supports over 125 local family farms, and attracts over half a million shoppers a year.Those of us who are in those farmer's markets know what a wonderful place it is to build community and the district. Farmer's market is one of, if not the oldest ongoing neighborhood farmer's market in the United States. The District four nomenclature here for Chris Curtis Way was applied to a two block section of the AV between 50thand 52nd. Even though that's only one block long, it doesn't change the name of the street. It just installs one of those great honorary Brown signs and gives Chris the recognition that I think she rightly deserves for her 25 years worth of service on behalf of folks in small family farms and those of us who want toget access to their good work and good goods from around the city. As I mentioned this morning, our friends of the Neighborhood Farmer's Market Alliance are really hoping that Chris doesn't spend her retirement watching the Seattle Channel. So they're trying to keep this on the low down.So when you run into Chris around town, please don't mention it to her. But it's not going to take too long for us to unveil this at some Saturday morning at the User Farmers Market. And I'm grateful to you all for your support.Like you, are there any further comments or questions? I look forward to supporting Chris as well. What a treasure. Okay, I'll move to adopt resolution 31874. Second is removed and second, the resolution be adopted. Any further comments? Those in favor of adopting the resolution please vote.I. I. Those oppose vote no. The motion carries. The resolution stopped and chair was sign it. Is there any further business coming for the council? Herring. Then we stand adjourned. And everyone have a great rest of the afternoon.Thank you.\nSummary:", "answer": "A RESOLUTION providing an honorary designation of University Way NE, from NE 50th Street to NE 52nd Street, as “Chris Curtis Way.”"}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nOh he's excited about the owner supported. Yes so it is an owner supported this is for the entire block and it is divided into contributing and non contributing areas. The contributing areas include the 1926 schoolhouse as well as in 1847 and 1956 editions.This was submitted to CPD on April 1st. It went through the Landmark Preservation Commission. It went through the committee first reading and second reading is right now. All of the notices were done correctly. It was posted on the website in legal journals and all of the RINO's were noticed.This is a slightly different application, so I'm going to kind of talk about this as being Denver public schools were involved as this is their property. They have a policy called the fee policy, which deals with historic schools.And the intent is to facilitate the long term preservation of the school district's most architecturally and historically significant schools, but also to meet the board's ongoing responsibilities for educational requirements and to provide flexibility for future generations to construct new facilities.The route for this particular designation started with a certificate of non historic status in 2012. Denver Public Schools withdrew it after historic Denver expressed interest in landmark designation. They initiated the FB policy evaluation. They hired the architectural firm of Slater Paul to complete the historic structures analysis.The HSA confirmed the National Register of Eligibility Determinations that there was that it is eligible and that there are adaptive use potentials for the building. So Denver Public Schools convened the Historic Evaluation Committee, which is made up of historic Denver Landmark Preservation Staff and History, Colorado.They basically agreed with the HSA findings and the committee determined to prioritize the designation of the Welton Street site as an option. Denver Public Schools formed a sales advisory committee and they wanted to balance capital needs, downtown development, zoning needs and preservation values.The city and county of Denver then hired Humphrey Polies and there is actually a representative of them in the crowd as well. If you have questions to do a study of this and to rate the designation and they felt that that they wanted to preserve the most significant buildings, which are those along Welton Street.And so the recommendations from this study were the basis of the application that's before you. This is a slightly different application. It's going to be kind of three parts. There's the standard designation that you guys have seen in the past.And then there are two other sections, one that deals with the design and development patterns, and it's an addendum to it. And then there's also a supplemental design standards and guidelines, which is an attachment. So part one for the Emily Griffith School.It is designated as a structure. Its zoning is DC and you one it's for the entire block of 170, which has been the historic boundary of the school since about the 1940s. But we understand that there's a large redevelopment for this particular area.So this is an opportunity to integrate the older historic building along with new construction. So the contributing area is along Welton Street. These are architect designed buildings. They were purposely planned and designed as the main street of the school.They were the primary operations and classrooms here. And these have the strongest association and history with Emily Griffith herself. The non contributing portion along Glenn Arm has some consistency in the architectural style, but it's much more simple. These parcels were purchased over time and there's less of a design plan for those.So in order to be listed, it has to have integrity and it has to meet two out of the following three categories and relate to a historic context or theme. This particular property has very high integrity. The school, while it was originally built on the edge of downtown and had more of a mixed residential and commercial settingoriginally still is in the same location. The original architect's design is intact, the brick and terracotta is visible, and it still has a really strong street presence. It meets the criteria under history for direct association with historical development of the city.The school was founded in 1916 and it provided an alternate education for the residents. It's a very innovative and early form of this kind of education. There was a lot of work for workforce training, for auto mechanics, plumber, plumbers.It helped build a competitive, competitive workforce for Denver. And there were a lot of partnerships during World War One and World War Two with the Emily Griffith School for Training the Workforce. It's also directly related to Emily Griffith herself.She was the driving force behind this. Behind this school, she is was the principal until 1933. She founded in 1916. And she is recognized at the state capitol as a very important woman within Colorado history. The property is also significant for its architecture.The original 1926 design has Renaissance revival styles with Beaux-Arts embellishments, and it's done with a lot of brick and terracotta details. The 1947 and the 1956 additions integrate the brick and terracotta, but they use an international style. And this would be one of the first international style buildings in Denver if it is designated.And finally it meets it under geography. This is a prominent location. It's just off of Colfax. It's highly visible. This school was called out on travel maps of the early 20th century, and it's one of the few remaining historic schools in the downtown area.It relates to the themes of vocational and continuing education, as well as women's history. And the period of significance for this property is 1916 to 1956. The Landmark Preservation Commission determined that it had physical integrity, that it met the criteria under history for historical development, as well as being associated with an important person that embodied distinguishing characteristicsof an architectural style or type, and that it had a prominent location and was geographically significant. They also believed it in its historic context and themes of Denver, and they voted unanimously 6 to 0 to recommend it going forward.So part two of this particular designation is intended to help preserve the most significant parts of the building that are associated with Emily Griffith to retain the sense of massing and form as these distinct buildings and to make sure they're visually, visually prominent on the site.But it's also to accommodate new construction and the idea that there's going to be new, dense development primarily along the glenarm side of this. And so it's to ensure that you can integrate both the old and the new.So within this there will be a contributing a non contributing section within the non contributing section. Applications for demolition would not go to the Landmark Preservation Commission, but would be approved by staff. However, they would not be released until there was a replacement plan that was approved by the LPC.That is actually also true within the most part of the contributing areas. There's the demolition area for contributing that could also be approved by LPC staff for demolition. However, it would have to have a replacement plan improved in place by the approved by the LPC and also a plan that would show if you demolished part of thecontributing building that the rest of the building could still be retained and would still stay up. That does not include the demolition, does not include the initial 1926 building, building, as well as the facing of the 1947 and the 1956 addition.Within that, what we're calling the preserved area that would go through the typical landmark preservation design guidelines would go through on the typical design guidelines that are currently in place. It includes the significant buildings along along Welton Street on the key Frontages and retains the cantilevered vestibule that's on 13th Street.Any part of demolition that would go through on the preserved area would be subject to the general chapter 30. So in terms of design parameters for this, there are two areas that are restricted, firm, any type of development.There the small yellow areas, restricted areas one and two. And the intent of that is to preserve the size of the buildings and give some sort of allow those buildings to remain prominent, the historic buildings on the site, while also allowing for development and growth in the transitional height area, which is the area that can be demolished, although it is a contributing building that would be allowed up to 112 feet. The remaining part is only restricted by zoning and the state owned state capital of you in terms of the size of the development and in the.Part that faces glenarm. And so this is kind of just to illustrate some of the areas that could be preserved in the areas that would allow for development. The yellow portion of that is the preserved area, and it's illustrated above is the part that would be protected and then you would have the non restricted height envelope andwould allow to go as high as a zoning would allow for that area. So in order to sort of enforce that and to maintain that part of it will preserve, but also allowing for new construction. There are design standards and guidelines, and these are intended to be customized design guidelines for this particular site.It's to allow significantly larger construction abutting or connecting with the historic building. And so it's to encourage and integrate both the old and the new and to ensure thorough and high quality architectural design, articulation and materials for new construction.This is a separate document that would be approved as part of this designation process. Landmark Preservation reviews the design guidelines and standards as part of the designation as a whole, and then they in the preserved area in the other areas, they would combine the traditional design guidelines with the new design guidelines that are attached with this designation. Those design guidelines are intended to address the transitional height area, the restricted areas, as well as the zoning restricted areas. And there divided into four parts with an addendum that talks about the character defining features of the historic building at the Landmark Preservation Commission.There were there was a letter from historic Denver, which is a co applicant, as well as 30 additional emails and letters of support. We have not received any other emails since the Landmark Preservation Commission Commission hearing. There were four comments from the public.Three were in support and one was in opposition. And the Landmark Preservation Commission passed this unanimously.Thank you. We have four speakers and I'll.Call all.Four and you can make your way up the beat to Bruce and Levinsky, Jane Chrisler and Sarah McCarthy so you can make your way up and Ms.. Bruce can begin your remarks.Thank you. Good evening, everyone.I am DEVITA Bruce.I have the pleasure of serving as the director of operations, outreach and engagement for our Denver Public Schools. Mr. President, Councilman Brooks, and other distinguished members of Council, thank you for the opportunity to speak speak briefly regarding the historic designation bill for the Emily Griffith Opportunity site.What you have before you is a culmination of years of thoughtful dialog and a broad with a broad spectrum of stakeholders with varied interests. As DPS prepared for the sale of the site.We were seeking to.Create a designation that honors the legacy of Emily Griffith and the countless contributions she made to the field of education.The city of Denver and the state of Colorado.How fitting that this designation bill occurs and the year that we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Emily of Emily Griffith's first school. We also recognized that it was important to establish a set of design guidelines that provided greater certainty and clarity for potential developers as they determined how this prominent square city block could continue to bea catalyst for future opportunity. What we.Discovered.In the act of this exploration was a pathway that allowed committed stakeholders to proactively resolve competing interests to get to an outcome that met the needs of all. Each step of the process leading to the has this.Historic designation.And design guidelines has been carefully considered. Having the support of the historic community as evidenced by historic Denver being a co applicant. There is a testament to what is possible.With the synergy.Of collaboration, the willingness of the civic, business and development communities to engage and provide input on how to balance the goals of the school district and the interests of the broader community has been invaluable. Just as Emily Griffith herself opened the doors of opportunity for all who wish to learn.Our hope is that the certainty provided with this designation will yield continued opportunity for downtown Denver and ultimately for the.91,000.Students currently served by DPS. Thank you for your consideration of this bill. As Denver Public Schools seeks to utilize all available resources to ensure that every child succeeds. Thank you.Thank you. Annie Levinsky and this 76 minutes.Thank you. Hi, I'm Annie Levinsky. I'm the executive director of Historic Denver, located at 1420 Ogden Street.And I'm really thrilled to be here tonight. And it's not quite.The 11th hour.Yet. And fortunately, it's not the 11th hour for the Emily Griffith Opportunity School. We've been.Working on this.As the beta mentioned, for several years, more than three years of analysis and.Conversation and planning.And so I really want to thank DPS for their willingness to take a really careful look at this site before it transitions out of public.Ownership for the first time in 150 years.And I also want to thank the.City and.Brad Buchanan's leadership in helping the stakeholders.Work through the details related to this designation and the redevelopment concept before you.Tonight.Historic Denver does have a long history of working with DPS regarding historic schools, and in the 1990s we received a National Trust.Honor Award for efforts that.Encouraged student led designations of many of our most important public school buildings. And Sarah McCarthy will.Speak in a minute.But she was one of the volunteers that was really intimately.Involved in that.In the early 2000s, the program was further structured through.The DPS policy.RFP, which.Karen mentioned the policy at that time. DPA also conducted a survey.Of many of its UN designated buildings and ranked them from Tier one through Tier three, with Tier one.Being the schools that were most appropriate for historic.Designation. And Emily Griffith.Was identified as one of the Tier one schools.In 2012 when word spread.That DPS plan to move the school program from the.Site. Historic Denver heard from many concerned.Community members about what would happen to the buildings. We reached out to DPS to express the importance of preservation and they agreed to work with us and implement the policy outlined in policy. F.B. The process outlined in policy be the Emily Griffith.Site and specifically the Welton Street side of the campus, has been in public ownership for more than 150 years, with.The first public school opening there in the 1870s.In 1916.DPS granted Griffith, who was then principal at.Crofton Elementary.School, still standing, and Curtis Park.The permission to open a.Nontraditional school for all who wish to learn in the vacant building on the site. Based on her early teaching experiences, Griffith recognized.The needs of not only her students, but also their parents. Her first offerings at the Opportunity School included English language courses, citizenship.Courses and technical training programs. By the 1920s, the school.Was so popular that DPS.Invested in its expansion, constructing the classical.Revival style building that now sits at the corner of 12th and Welton.It was later expanded with Annex to.Significant international style.Additions that complement the 1920s building.One in 1947 and one in 1956. And that really.Completed the build out of the Walton Street side of the.Campus and replaced that earlier school, the Longfellow School, that had.Stood and been first used.Gradually and incrementally.DBC then acquired the property.Along Glenarm place to build a variety of one story shops. The 1926.47 and 56 buildings along Welton Street are interconnected.And today are experienced as one.Building.With multiple entrances.The interconnected structure clearly and definitely meets all three criteria.In the landmark ordinance for designation.Representing the most historically, architecturally.And geographically significant.Aspects of the Emily Griffith site.And serving as a symbol of her legacy.It is through the doors along Welton that more than a million students have access to education and opportunity, and it is above these doors that the school's values of opportunity and achievement are emblazoned. Griffith's legacy is.Profound and historic. Denver feels strongly that it deserves.To be physically represented in a.Place that has deep and authentic history. We are confident that the Welton Street buildings, deemed most significant through this whole process, can meet the.Site's.Story and represent its architectural character. The designation application before you clearly identifies the structures on Welton as the structures for preservation and the smaller one story structures on Glenarm place as non contributing. This means the buildings on the Glen own side of the block may be approved for demolition without a public hearing.And historic Denver fully anticipates and is aware that a new and most likely quite large development will take place in this location.DB has officially listed the property in the same week the designation was filed and we are commend them and thank them for doing this process concurrently so that both the prospective buyers of the site as well as the community will have certainty about its future.Before those discussions get too far underway. Preservation, as Devina mentioned, is most successful.When it is collaborative. We are grateful to the city, the Community Planning and Development Office.Humphreys Polay Architects, the Downtown Denver Partnership, and all these stakeholders for engaging in thoughtful and productive planning for a place with great importance in our community. The Emily Griffith process demonstrates that property owners and the preservation community can work together to find solutions that make our.City more unique.More vibrant and more adaptable for the future. So thank you.Thank you. Ms.. Levinsky. Jane Chrisler.Good evening. I'm Jane Kreisler with Humphreys Poly Architects. And we acted as a consultant to the city and Denver Public Schools. And I am here to answer any questions that you may have.Thank you.Thank you. Sam McCarthy.Good evening. Thanks for your attention. More than 20 years ago, a collaboration began between Denver's preservation community and Denver Public Schools, led by Jennifer Moulton, who was then the president of historic Denver. This effort sought to identify the district's architecturally and historically significant schools.We found dozens of them. More than 500 students researched the history of their schools in their community, its architectural style, so they could nominate their schools as Denver landmarks. Many dozens of these students came happily before this body to defend these nominations.DPS and historic Denver received a national award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation. For this program, I spoke of it as raising little preservationists. But we ran.Into a problem.Since the 1880s, DPS has been hiring noted local architects to design its schools using high quality materials and craftsmanship. These schools represent a spectacular 130 year span of the spectrum of architectural styles, ranging from.The 1880s. Richard Sony In Style through the.1920s Collegiate Gothic style to the 1950s Usonian and international styles until 1952. No. Two Denver schools were built alike. Denver schools were built to last 100 years and more. And they have, consequently. All the schools first surveyed met Denver's landmark commission criteria for designation to designate all would devalue the recognition.So a tearing system was to was developed to identify the districts most architecturally and historically significant schools. The Denver Board of Education established its policy to recognize this.Unique ranking process to support.The preservation of schools like Emily Griffith Opportunity that was ranked Tier.One while balancing.The district's responsibilities to educate our young residents. Schools are tangible symbols of the value the community places on education. And in Denver, the value of our history, especially our public assets. I applaud this continuing collaboration. I wholeheartedly support this.Nomination.And encourage you to vote yes quickly.Thank you, Ms.. McCarthy.That concludes our speakers. Time for questions of members of council. Councilman Flynn.Thank you, Kara. Could you would the height of anything that's going to go behind it? 112 feet? What is the height of the 1926 building?I am sorry. I don't know that off the top of my head.I'm just trying to get a relative sense of the.Changes that it's three and a half stories. I'm sorry, three and a half stories.So.Four 4147.5157.Thank you. That's almost perfect. I just want to get a sense of the scale.Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Brooks?Yeah. Kira, quick question. Thank you, Mr. President. Gina is the Gina guy. Is he the one who who wrote or that person? Is that the one who wrote the letter of opposition or spoken opposition?I can double check the name. I don't have it right here in front of it.It is. But just can you give us for just this?She was basically concerned that designating the historic property would lower the value that Denver Public Schools could get for the land. Another member then of the community then spoke up who was part of the sales advisory group and felt that this would allow for a good value for Denver public schools.Knowing the surface.Is Gina a part of DPS at all or just a concerned citizen?I not that I'm aware of. I believe she's just a concerned citizen.Okay, thanks.Thank you. Councilmember in other questions, 311. Seeing on public hearing is now closed. Comments.Councilman Brooks, how many questions for this one, huh? I am excited and really happy to support this designation. I always love to hear KERA Dona Dona owner support it, but I personally was involved this couple of years ago with in the process and was in the early meetings with Down Syndrome in partnership with Davida, leading those meetingswith Annie Levinsky with many stakeholders. And I want to be clear that we are celebrating today, but there were many days in that room where I think I think folks were pretty far apart. And it's just amazing to see the community kind of come together.And I think Bradley can and played a huge role in that as well with his ideas as well. And so I'm excited to support this. Sara, I appreciate you bringing up Jennifer Moulton. You know, for for some of us younger urban leaders, she was a visionary that we long to live after as we're city builders here.And so I appreciate you bringing her up. The other reason I really am supportive of this is I think it sets a precedent for what we can begin to to see the integration of new development in historical buildings in downtown begin to look like.So thank you for the Denver Public Schools for being a part of this and being so open around this whole issue and everybody else who works so hard to be supporting this.In Katherine Brooke. Councilman each.Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Councilman Brooks, for the role you played in the process. I was actually going to remember a time slightly even before that, which was with my former colleague, Councilwoman Raab, who really we have to credit her for helping to start the conversation early when the certificate of non historic status was filed. Our first meeting that I went to with Councilwoman Raab with the district was not so supportive. There was a flat out statement that there's just no market potential for this site if we do designation. And Councilwoman Raab, with her experience, was really able to offer the ideas of bringing in developers with expertize to get their input.And I think there was a walk through that happened really early in the process, even before there was a commitment to the committee. And that walk through is an example where folks were in I don't remember who we got.We had suggested folks like Dana Crawford and Charles Wooley and and but to to hear from folks to say there are ways that this could be done. You know, and I think that that first seed of it could be possible.I just want to thank Councilwoman Robb and for her, I think, diligence in helping to kind of help plant that seed and and help do a little activism. And I'm very glad that we have the happy story that we do.But sometimes in those early days, it takes a strong advocate to get that started. And so in this case, I just want to honor her and I'm excited to support this today. My experience with Emily Griffith is through the amazing construction apprenticeships that they have hosted at that school, all of the construction apprenticeships, including most of theunion and a few of the nonunion, they get 42 hours of college credit and they've been earning them through a certification that Emily Griffith provided. So one of the things I hope with this designation in this redevelopment is that we get apprentices working on this building as it's rebuilt around with the new development.That would be a great way to bring Emily Griffith's legacy to a completion. So I hope you negotiate that in your sale contract because it would be a missed opportunity if we didn't anyway. Happy to support it tonight.Thank you.Thank you. Councilwoman. Can each next. Councilman Espinosa.Yeah. Comments. I just wanted to say, this is brilliant. This is a genius. Love it. Love how creative everybody was. And I like the councilman, Brooks said. I hope it sets a precedent. I know this is not easy work and we can't always do this, but I do think we should.We should be able to figure out how to when we have those buildings that we go, oh, when we see it, when a proposal comes in, whether they've applied for historic MENA status or, you know, it's going to lead, there is do we have the tools to sort of capture both new development in a creative fashion?I think part of the charm of Europe is they figured that out. And so we sort of have the two extremes. It's either preservation and maintaining it in its in in an intact form or gone. And there's actually a lot of potential in in this sort of blending.And so where we have those opportunities, I'm glad to see this this happen and this tool exists because I think we're seeing it over there potentially at the tavern as well. So thank you to historic Denver, Annie and John Annie.You guys are doing a wonderful job and CPD staff. Thank you, Brad. Thank you. So thanks.Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Flynn.Thank you, Mr. President. Shooting. There are very few places in Denver that I think can match this site for its historical significance, along with its connection to so many, probably thousands of residents of Denver. I can think of maybe Union Station as another example where not only a historic structure, a magnificent structure, a beautiful structure, but onethat has a connection to the daily lives of of so many people who grew up in Denver. And it's just a pleasure to to see this. It's it's almost an emotional connection to this building with a lot of people in Denver who took advantage of what what Emily Griffith established in 1916.And I think, Mr. President, my only regret is that the building on the on the Glenarm Street side is is going to be demolished because we taped so many programs from DPS on Channel six of Don Kinney's State of Colorado show in there.And I think just for that reason, it ought to be historic, but it'll be sad to see that one go. Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilwoman Black.Thank you, Mr. President. I know the answer is no. I know you want us to stop talking, but I just have to say, I have a long personal history with this school. My dad taught there in the fifties.He taught bookkeeping and accounting. And I have a very long personal history with the Denver Public Schools. Hello, David. A long time supporter of DPS and the Emily Griffith Opportunity School, which is no longer called that. And as co-chair of the 2012 Bond Committee, we talked about this building a lot because its sale was supposed to fundthe purchase of 1860. Lincoln, which is the home of the new Emily Griffith Technical School and High School. So I know everyone figured out a way to make it all happen, so I couldn't be more thrilled and also thrilled that Emily Griffith's legacy continues at 1860.Lincoln, which is now called the Emily Griffith campus and all of the things that she worked for are still happening today. And it's really incredible. And it is one of the greatest success stories of the Denver public schools.So thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman Black. Councilman Lopez.I am picking that up from that screen. I am super enthusiastic about this designation. You know, I think Councilman Flynn really hit the hammer or really hit the nail on the head and that it has so many such a big connection to so many people in the area.I talked about him earlier, but my grandfather was pictures right here and played the role of my dad. He was called to service in World War Two before he can finish high school from Ault, Colorado from up north and really use a beat picker.He ended up coming back and was able to finish that a program for folks who if they had, he was an older high school student. So after they came back from the service, he came back and finished his high school diploma at Emily Griffith.And that was the impact that that had for him in his life. But there's so many people around that time in Denver. Emily Griffith was the school. It was the school to go to. Yes, it was west and east and north and south.But you still had Emily Griffith right there. And he was able to do that, finish out and. You know, provide a foundation for a lot for a lot of his children and grandchildren. And I think, you know, that that's the historic nature of the school.We can talk about the architecture, but in its walls and in its brick and mortar, those kind of stories throughout Denver. So, you know, thank you. I'm proud to vote yes for this.Thank you, Councilman Lopez. I believe that all the speakers.Are actually all the councilmembers are chime in our.Screens. Kind of crazy right now. I think that's everybody. So they were good. All right. So you know the comments, Madam Secretary, wrong call. Roll call.Brooks. Hi, Clark. Hi, Espinosa. Hi, Flynn Hi.

However, instead of using this revised plan for the proposed new oil drilling project within the zoning area, the old outdated sea dip plan was used for the air and coastal.Commission applications. This has required a number of changes to CDEP to allow for different land uses in four parcels, including oil drilling in places where it was not allowed previously. We are confused by these changes to sea dip, since Sea Dip will now be updated by tonight's changes.Does that mean that C CIP will not be sent to the Coastal Commission for approval? If C sip is to replace c dip with all of these changes you're making tonight, be automatically transferred to c sip or we'll see cip also have to be amended to allow the oil drilling.Especially troubling is item M on page 28, which discuss an extension of Studebaker Road. The extension of Studebaker Road was removed from c cip. And must be removed from sea dip on August 18th. The Coastal Commission approved oil drilling on the most storied US Wetlands Authority, five acres and pumpkin patch with many requirements.What you will find listed in your staff report. It wasn't read to you tonight in the in this report.Although Coastal.Commission staff has worked very hard to attempt to modify and mitigate the potential.Harm.Which might be done by new oil drilling in an environmentally sensitive area. We find that most of these modifications are inadequate. There is an argument as to whether the five acres in the pumpkin patch are esher but there is no argument that the lost Cerritos Wetlands, the San Gabriel River, Alamitos Bay and the Pacific Ocean could be. You know, your time is up.By an oil.Spill. Thank you.Corliss Lee, of course.Thank you very much. Next, the next speaker.I see.Yeah. Okay. Thank you.Okay. Carelessly. And my address is on file. I am also a member of carp, continuing on monitoring sensors and shut off valves will have little use in a large earthquake. Your yes vote tonight is saying that you are willing to add the following 15 modifications to sea dip in order to allow oil drilling.Please consider carefully what you are voting for. Here are just a few. Modification five environmentally sensitive habitat areas as defined in the Coastal Act shall be protected against any significant disruption of habitat values and only users dependent on those resources shall be allowed with these areas.And the carp comment on that is, I repeat, that oil drilling will be disrupting the habitat areas. The pumpkin patch contains wetland, obligate plant and animal species, which will be permanently destroyed by both drilling and industrial uses. Modification seven.All development that would be adversely impact archeological or paleontology or logical resources shall include reasonable mitigation measures. And the question is what are these measures and reasonable to whom the local Native Americans do not find digging in, drilling on or degrading their sacred lands as reasonable?Modification eight The scenic and visual qualities of coastal areas shall be considered and protected. And here's the carp comment. Most people do not consider a 160 foot drilling rigs and 18 foot block walls as scenic or visual qualities.Modification nine All development shall minimize risks to life and property in areas of high geologic flood and fire hazard. And the carp comment is both. Both of these proposed drilling areas are near the Newport-Inglewood fault area in a tsunami and flood zone.The best way to minimize risks to life and property in these areas is to not allow oil drilling. Modification ten All development shall assure stability and structural integrity and neither create nor contribute significantly to erosion, geologic instability or destruction of the site or surrounding area.And the carp comment is it will be impossible to drill hundreds of feet down next to an earthquake fault, extract oil and then force water back into the void and guarantee geologic stability. So there's several more on here, and I don't think I can get through them in the next 15 seconds.But you might want to look intensely at this report and realize what you're signing up for. This isn't something to take lightly, and you don't want to commit to something you can't do. So thank.You. Thank you very much. Speaker.And Christensen protect the Long Beach Low Cerritos wetlands. It said in the agenda item that you've read all the enclosed materials, but I'm just going to highlight some of our statement from Protect the Long Beach Low Cerritos Wetlands.And it really has a lot to do with environmental racism. So we would hope that people could find a moment to listen. The city's stated intent is to amend Sea Sick to comply with a new oil drilling project that that you guys already approved over the objections of many tribal members.Given the fact that oil production facilities proposed for both the site, the new sites were completely altered the surface areas and allow for toxic chemicals to be used and stored on these sites. Given the fact that oil drilling operations would extend for miles under the low cerritos wetlands and include the instruct extraction in re injection of millionsof gallons of water. Given the fact that the construction of massive storage tanks, pipelines, methane burn off towers will disrupt damage and destroy wildlife and habitat. Given the fact that the operation of these on any new or other new oil accessories will extend the life and massively increase the volume of fossil fuel extraction from the Sea Cityarea, pollute air and water and involve spills, possibly on a scale that cannot be contained. Given the fact that fossil fuels contribute to global warming and sea rise, one must conclude that all of the above are to be sacrificed in order to promote new oil drilling operations in the coastal zone and in and adjacent to the lowcerritos wetlands over and adjacent to the Newport-Inglewood fault in an area subject to liquefaction. And in an urban area because Caesar proposes housing 4000 new residents. Actually, it's apartments, I think, more or more along the edge of the low cerritos wetlands.Place is central to the identity and continued existence of tribal peoples. The history, the health, the future of tribal peoples is rooted in the connection to specific lands and waters. The connection is one of stewardship, not exploitation or extraction of resources.To remove is to disconnect the people from the land, to remove the evidence and erase the tribal history of the land, and to devalue the meaning it has to present and future generations. Directly to Coastal Commission staff member Kate Hucker Bridge Chief Anthony Ramos.You honored a couple of chiefs tonight. Here's another one. Chief Anthony Morales. Gabriel Nino. Tonga. San Gabriel. Band of Mission Indians voiced his tribe's opposition, his tribal council's opposition to the proposed amendments to the LCP, which is what you're voting for tonight.Chief Morales raised concerns that proposed oil and gas production activities would adversely impact sacred sites and anti ancestral mean. He called them genocide.Fine. Thank you for telling me that.Uh, good evening, Mayor Garcia and council members. My name is Michael Assad, on which the beautiful mineral sport bump. I'll keep it brief. I just wanted to say thank you to the city staff for their diligent work and coordinating with Coastal Commission staff to get this LCP approved at the Coastal Commission and under a year.That's truly remarkable. So we say thank you. I also wanted to say thank you to all the public support we got here at city council hearings at the Coastal Commission, especially by the CWA, the nation, the coast, Reno's Wetlands, Land Trust and the El Dorado Audubon Society.Um, so I wanted to thank all of them as well, and we urge you to support the staff recommendation and the Coastal Commission's actions on this. Thank you.Thank you very much. Is there any more public comment on this item? If not, please take a vote.Motion carries.Thank you. Now we'll go to a hearing. Number three.\nSummary:", "answer": "Recommendation to declare ordinance amending and restating in its entirety Southeast Area Development and Improvement Plan (SEADIP) (PD-1), read and adopted as read.  (District 3)"}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThank you. Now we move to item number 34.Item 34 is a communication from Councilmember Richardson. Councilwoman Cindy has councilmen subpoena recommendation to request city manager to work with financial management to waive used user fees and charges for the most valuable Long Beach independent food service restaurants with an emphasis on equity and request.Director of Economic Development to develop a Long Beach restaurant retention plan.That's when Richardson Bank Vice Mayor. So a few things. So it's been an ongoing discussion on. Again with a few months back comprehensive really difficult to move forward. Most recently, I want to thank Councilman Supernova for continuing that discussion and having some discussions earlier this month about additional resource for restaurants.The idea here is that we want to sort of build on the two from four memo from city staff that we requested that looked at sort of breaking down the cost and give some direction on how we want to proceed on in the immediate term, but also take all of the larger conversations and package them into arestaurant retention strategy that can roll out over the months to come. And the goal with the retention strategy is really to set some benchmarks and goals. If we've heard rhetoric, about 50% of restaurants not surviving. We want to beat that.We want to increase that 60%, 70% survival rate. But that means we have to be intentional and focused. So the idea here with this motion we want to take, based on the 2.4 memo from staff, they identify what the cost would be.And we we see that the full service restaurant portion, the total cost was like 23 million bucks. But when you narrow down the full service restaurants, you're talking 2 million bucks, $2 million to address some of the health fees, bar fees and some of these other issues.And we want to narrow that down also. We want it to be local, independent. We're not talking about, let's say, a fast food chain. Right. We're talking full service, local, independent repair. That number down a bit. And that's the direction we want to give the staff.This should be we should be thinking about this in terms of we know that we offered some relief up until September 31st. We want this to be sort of at the go back, you know, from March. This past March to sort of into the next year.You want to add some type of relief in the program that Steph brings back? And so that's the idea here. We've got a lot of a lot of discussion, a lot of research already done. We want to give this discussion and also give some general direction on how we move forward more broadly around restaurants.Thank you so much. And that's my final thank you contribution. When you probably comment on this item.No public no public coming.By.Vice Mayor. I think we need a second. I'd like to see motion.Yes. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Okay. Any other council member comments on this?And I would just like. Sorry. I would just like to say that I'm really looking forward to this item. I think it's very important that we really focus on helping out our restaurants who are, of course, suffering a lot through this pandemic.It was already too much when they were closed for one month. But now we're going on six months. And it's they're struggling, especially the small business restaurants. And I think that that's this item is really designed to help those local that that have been struggling through this time and, you know, really emphasizing on helping them stay openafter this pandemic. So, again, let's let's support our local businesses. Thank you.Pretty much any other councilman would like to speak on of.Vice Mayor, this is Tom. If I can say something when the council's done speaking.Yes, sir.Vice Mayor. Councilman Mungo?Yes, go ahead.Thank you. I appreciate that. This continues to be a focus. It's something that I feel strongly about and continue to work on. I think that it's important for us to maintain the focus on the criteria that was outlined two weeks ago.And so I just had a question for the maker of the motion. It talks in the agenda item about a couple of variations, but the item that was approved by the council two weeks ago talked about prioritizing any kinds of funds that could become available from.Either a fee waivers if there ends up being a limit or suspensions to be prioritized based on restaurant losses, based on either a mix of loss of revenue and on avoidable costs or just a gross loss of revenue.I just wanted to make sure that this item just mirrors the item of two weeks ago and that that is still being maintained or if I needed to make a friendly amendment to maintain that.Sure. I think what we want to bifurcate quickly, I think we're talking on the first part of this motion, just on the fees. I think we want to be just very clear on the criteria we outlined, which is full service restaurants, local, independent.I think.That's.Ongoing. Right.I get I get that. And what.I'm asking. Yes.I'm let me just finish the thought. And I think we're we're speaking past each other. I think what you're talking about is the ongoing incentives moving forward and that yeah, I think we can conclude that those sort of issues as we factor into the larger retention strategy.So I think the answer is yes as it relates to the sort of the broader strategy, because we haven't defined what those incentives would be. But we do know enough about sort of fee, the fire fee and those things.Some have paid we want to see those get some rebates and then we want we want to have that relief. So some who are paid get some rebates, some who haven't paid. We want to get them some relief.In terms of the fees that we talked about last time. We're talking about the same universe counseling other.Right. So it does exactly what we already did two weeks ago, which is. And. And if there is only enough. So are you or is your expectation that the study that Councilman Super Nine requested would also come back with.Um. Let me go back. My expectation and maybe this is the question from Mr. Modica, my expectation is that Councilmember Supernova's request, along with Councilwoman Price's friendly amendment, commuted those fees immediately and that we are hoping to give rebates and refunds.The report you provided quickly, which, by the way, city staff need a significant acclimation for being able to provide that report so quickly. And we appreciated receiving it last night. It is a wealth of information, but now we know that the number to be able to mitigate those full-service restaurants is just over $2 million.If every one of those categories are waive or refundable and that and my understanding of Councilmember Superstore's request would be that we find a place to get that money from. It's great to have a feasibility study, but it's only feasible if revenues can fill that hole because you can't just not pay the fire workers the fire service, and you can't not pay the the health service health office staff.Thank you. Councilman, do you have one minute, please?Mr. Monica.Yes. What we understand is what she passed two weeks ago was a feasibility study. I agree with the way you summarize it with one small change. We didn't go ahead and waive all fees during that time. It was a feasibility study.What we did in response was to bias. More time was to it was all going to be due August 30th. That was how long the council had given previously. And we and I've extended that to October 31st provided the Council doesn't have alternate direction on that.So that gives us some time to do the study that Mr. Zupan asked for and the council approved. And then what is in front of you tonight is is providing further direction on how to look at that data and for what steps should be bringing back in addition to what DRC Burnard put forward.And what would you say those additional things are that need to come back? Because I thought. I just. I'm curious.I would leave that to the maker of the motion to really describe it as I understand it. It it has to do with looking at a smaller subset. It has to look at some equity. It has to look at, you know, businesses that are Long Beach focused.That's my understanding, as well as coming back with a larger restaurant retention plan that we can spend some time on and come back with ideas.Public safe. Well, I hope that equity could be found in that all $2 million. Excuse me. Oh, I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you. Super frustrating. I hear you.One more minute. This is Mongo. You have one more minute.Thank you, sir. My hope would be that all restaurants included in that category, should we be able to come up with the right criteria, would be able to get that abatement. And so that would be approximately $2 million.So I appreciate the prioritization, but now that we know that the number is only $2 million and these restaurants do put so much back into the economy in terms of employing people, especially those in the Latin and African-American communities, that that the priority would be citywide to take all of those businesses.So those are my comments. And thank you for owners who worked with us on that, on the the issues at play and the city staff who contributed excellent work from Mr. Gross's office.Thank you very much, madam. Anyone else I can speak on the side of? Okay with that, we have a first and second question of interest in motion and second by Mrs. Sanders. Would you please call the vote?District one. I district to district three. I just took four. I just took five.I.District six.By.District seven. District eight. District nine. Tie motion carries.Thank you. Okay. With that, I would like to make a motion to continue the rest of the items pending tonight, next week. Can I please get a second? Second were. Thank you, councilman austin. No. Please. No.\nSummary:", "answer": "Recommendation to request City Manager to work with Financial Management to waive, from March 1st, 2020 through March 31st, 2021, user fees and charges for the most vulnerable Long Beach, independent, full-service restaurants, with an emphasis on equity; and\r\n\r\nRequest Director of Economic Development and other appropriate departments to develop a Long Beach Restaurant Retention Plan, designed to improve the economic survival of restaurants impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic across Long Beach."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nI received. Thank you. Item 26 Report from Financial Management Recommendation to receive and file the results of the user fee and cost recovery studies for the Energy, Resources and Public Works Department citywide.So, Mr. Mayor, we've done this several times with the council over the last probably two years where we pick a department and we go through and we do a really in-depth analysis of the fee structure of what a service costs and what a fee should be set at and determining the right subsidy level.And so we do have a presentation for you tonight. We have gone in-depth into public works and energy resources. You're not adopting or approving any fees tonight. Tonight is the ability to get informed on the work, to ask us questions, to raise any concerns you have.And then we'll come back in April with the actual fee increases and changes. And so I will be turning the presentation over to our finance team to walk through it with the departments.Great. Thanks, Tom. This is Grace. Good evening, Mayor, and members of the city council. As Tom mentioned, this is our second round of the city wide field study and has been completed for two departments, public works and energy resources.And as Tom mentioned, there are no actual changes to the master fee and charges schedule being proposed tonight. But again, the purpose of today's presentation is to provide you all with an overview and an opportunity to make comments, and we will come back for formal approval on April 12th.So with that, I will pass it over to Geraldine Vallejo, our revenue officer, who will be first providing a general background on fees and the citywide fee study. Then we will turn the presentation over to public works and energy resources will each go over the highlights of their department's study findings and their recommended fee changes.Thank you, Grace. If I can get next slide. Next slide. Next slide. Good evening, Mayor, and members of the city council. As a reminder, fees and charges include two types of categories user fees and regulatory fees, both of which are included in the city wide measure fees and charges, schedule rent and penalties are also included in masterfees and charges. Schedule for convenience, but are not subject to the cost of service limitations. Next slide. User fees and regulatory fees may not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of providing the service or program. City policy requires that fees are set at the cost of service, except where there is a greater public benefit using a lower fee. As the department presentations will highlight. This includes pandemic related financial hardship and maintaining and encouraging access to popular services. Next slide. The city currently has routine processes in place to ensure that these are reviewed and updated regularly to capture annual cost increases.The city implements an annual inflation adjustment based on city cost increases called the City Cost Index. The master fees and charges schedules are adopted each year with the budget with any proposed changes by the departments and CPI updates.Mid-Year adjustments are also periodically submitted to City Council. The next citywide fee adjustment letter will be presented to City Council on April 12. Next time. Each Fee Adjustment Council letter includes an estimated revenue impact from proposed changes. The revenue impacts are theoretical and may not necessarily result in a budgeted revenue change by the same amount.Any adjustments to actual budgeted revenues must be evaluated holistically and consider a variety of factors such as the stability and certainty of the revenue source, as well as whether the department is meeting its current overall budgeted revenue commitments.This review and update is typically part of the overall budget development process. Next slide. The next slide. As a reminder, in fiscal year 19 and at council's direction, staff initiated an updated city wide study. Each department study will identify and review the fees charged, calculate the full service cost, determine intervention rates by comparing fee revenue to thefull cost of service and provide recommendations or fee levels or structures. Next slide. This is a multiyear project, and the project continues to move forward with city manager departments anticipated to be completed by the end of 2022. The first round concluded in fiscal year 21 and covered development services, parks and a portion of health.The second round includes energy, resources and public works. We'll be presenting study findings and department recommendations today. The third round is in progress and includes by our city manager and the remainder of Health and Human Services. Preliminary results and department recommendations are anticipated for summer 2022.Next slide. The consultant applied a consistent methodology across all department studies. Cost components are based on the 21 budget and includes direct costs and indirect costs. The cost components are then included into a fully burdened hourly rate per position.The allocated cost is determined by multiplying the fully paid in hourly rate to the staff time spent to support each service. After the fully allocated service cost is determined, it is compared to current fee revenues to identify the source of the revised service.Next ranks. This table is a summary of the cost, recovery and subvention rates per department and shows that the city is under-recovery for calculated service cost by 2.4 million. More information will be included as part of the fee department presentations.The cost and subvention rates are reported as general service categories or areas. Next site. The departments have reviewed the results of the studies and have the same recommendations. The majority of department recommendations align with the study but do deviate in some cases based on prioritizing different goals other than full cost recovery, as I noted earlier.These factors will be noted as part of each departmental presentation. Next slide. The departments will share more information on the recommendations. But to summarize here, the first table is a summary of the department's 22 midyear recommendations, which include no changes to current fees, rate increases and decreases.New and revised fee structures to align the services. And finally, there are fee deletions related to revised fee structures, as well as clean up to fees schedules for services no longer provided by the city. The department recommendations are anticipated to result in a theoretical annual revenue impact of $334,777, which will be reviewed during the budget process andwill vary based on usage and market or economic conditions. Next. This concludes this overview. I will now turn it over to Joshua Hickson of the Public Works Department for an overview of study findings and the department's recommendations for fiscal year 22.All right. Good evening. Thank you for that overview, Geraldine. And good evening, Mayor, and members of the City Council.The next time, please.Perfect. Thank you. The Pew study before you here tonight is really focused around the public works fees that are recovered based on the cost of services provided. So this study does not include fees related to reviews which are being studied separately as part of another effort and other fees that are not determined based on cost of services. Next slide, please.So the study's broken down.Into four different groups and overall the current fees are below the cost of service provided. Note The one exception is traffic engineering services, which we'll dove into a little bit further on a future slide. Next slide.In aggregate, taking into account the.Fee increases, the decreases in the percentage of cost recovery that Geraldine had had mentioned. Theoretically, the recommendations, if approved, could have a positive revenue impact of over 400,000. Next slide, please. So a couple of key items that we want you to consider.The proposed changes further enhance and streamline our planning, checking, permitting and inspection efforts that have been underway for the last couple of years. The commonly requested items that we receive, such as curb painting, have been added and the costs have been spread out over the next three years to avoid a steep increase given the importance of theseitems to the community. And finally want to highlight the traffic control plan review is separate from the planned check the as currently outlined in the current schedule. This recommendation will reflect the true cost of services which are actually higher than the cost of service today.Next slide, please. So roughly a quarter of the fees are recommended to be decreased based on processing efficiencies. Since the last study, a quarter are recommended to be removed to align with the current business practices. And you can see a couple examples here on the slide.Next slide, please. Another quarter are recommended to increase for full cost recovery. And approximately the last quarter of the fees are new fees or a restructure to existing fees to better align with today's current operations and to continue providing the critical services to the community.Next slide, please. So in.Summary, if.The recommendations are approved, the public works fees will be in line with or slightly lower than other local agencies. And this concludes the public works portion of the presentation. I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to Tony Foster with energy resources so he can move forward with presenting his portion of the presentation.Good evening, mayor and city council members. I'm here with our utility services office serving some of our teenagers to present a brief overview of the Energy Resources Department. Cost Recovery Fees, study results. Next slide, please. I'll keep it on the slide.Currently, Energy Resources lists 81 fees on the master fees and charges schedule. 75 of those fees are reviewed under this cost of services study. The remaining the remaining six fees were not included in the study because those are not what we call customer facing fees, but are rather related to internal administrative fees that do not impact costto gas utility customers or ratepayers. The subject fees being discussed here fall across four service categories construction and pipeline, gas services, engineering and Construction and Utility Services. Call center of these fees, the overall department cost recovery is 85%.Therefore, subvention currently falls at 15%. Next slide, please. Okay. This matrix illustrates cost recovery intervention rates at current levels across the four service categories by revenue and by percentage of total service costs across all four categories. The total calculated cost of services was 9.8 million, of which 8.3 million was collected, yielding a subvention of 1.5 million or85% recovery. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that a study of this type has been performed. So as you can see, the cost of recovery by service categories are not uniform. Next slide, please. All right. Based on the energy resources cost recovery frame, study results.Staff recommends proceeding with 56 rate changes in order to recoup costs and maintain operational needs. If all of the study recommendations were to be accepted, the estimated theoretical revenue impact is $8,675. In other words, energy resources would collect roughly 80,000 more than it currently qualifies.However, Energy Resources staff emphasized that this theoretical increase would present a hardship for many of the gas utility customers and ratepayers and support a partial acceptance of these recommended changes. The recommended total theoretical impact based on partial acceptance of the recommended changes is projected to reduce the pension to $104,525 based upon certain assumed variables such as thenumber of certain services or projects undertaken. In other words, based on the partial acceptance of the recommendations, if the projected number of product projects and services is accurate, energy services subvention losses fall to under $34,000. Next slide, please.Again, full cost recovery is not being recommended for all fees as some relate to. Utility. Ratepayers and department staff strongly believe that increasing these rates would cause a hardship to our customers during the rebound period from the COVID 19 pandemic and should therefore be delayed.The decision to proceed with changes to 56 fee items is based on infrastructure and operational needs as identified by the study. It is related to new construction, engineering projects, gas meter purchase and installations driven by requests for new services.For example, no contract or developer developers request for new gas services. Next slide, please. The next two slides summarize energy resources staff recommendations by change, which, for example, increase or decrease, no change and so on. So let's look at no change.Of the 17 fees recommended not to change, eight in the gas services and utility services were validated as accurate and are currently at cost. Recovery nine Gas services and utility services fees are recommended by staff to hold at current levels for the future, i.e. post-pandemic for review by staff and present.Tony. I think you got muted.Oh, I'm sorry. That's odd. So let's just start going with slide 30 here, if that's okay with you. So for the Fiji decrees, three fees in the engineering and construction services are recommended to decrease to better align with cost recovery and operational need.16 fees and the gas services segment are recommended to increase to better align with cost recovery and operational need and 35 fees across all energy resource services areas are recommended for restructure to better align with the provision of service.The detailed breakdown of these fees are presented in the attachment. B2 Next slide. The Energy Resources Department's rate structure does not easily compare across utilities in other jurisdictions. A primary reason for jurisdictional uniqueness is due to the specific policy goals and objectives of each city or utilities governing body.And it's important to note, however, that energy resources does consider consumer utility costs as they relate to the Southern California Gas Company to ensure fair and equitable rates. Specific fees are not compared to so-called gas, as energy resources is a municipality as opposed to an investor owned utility and therefore mandated to follow specific local and state guidelines. And this concludes our report, and we're happy to answer any questions.Thank you, Tony. So to wrap up this presentation and summary, three key points. The city is generally under-recovery for cost based on the study done for public works and energy resources. E through departments have proposed recommendations that generally align with the study's finding for full cost recovery.Exceptions to full cost recovery is based on the prioritization of other goals, such as resident's needs and the ability to pay and maintaining access to popular city services. And lastly, the theoretical revenues potentially generated from the proposed fee changes will be evaluated and included as appropriate as part of the proposed budget process in line with our financialpolicy. And again, we'll come back we're scheduled to come back April 12th, where city council can officially adopt these changes at that stage. This concludes the presentation. And Geraldine, the department and I are available for questions.If you have a motion by Councilmember Ringo to make it a second place. Second Bay Councilmember Sara Canterbury Aranda. Examiner During the presentation I saw some of my questions were answered in regards to where we stand with a market study in terms of where our fees lie compared to our competitors or our neighboring cities.Are we competitive? Are we in line? Or what's what's the status of our fees as compared to those of other jurisdictions? Geraldine?Yes. Council member. Each department presentation included the the comparison to comparable jurisdictions. And in it we found that we were generally inline, but it will depend on particular services or areas that you are inquiring about. So if you had a specific area as part of this presentation, will be happy to have the department answer that.Service calls an example. So, for example, getting on certain stuff is good.We're not changing the rules.Yeah, but those remain the same. And in short, they are comparable to other jurisdictions, in our case, Southern California Gas Company. Yes, it's a careful analysis because while we the city charter does mandate that our rates are comparable to their rates, their rates do bake in some cost of services, like turn on turnovers.As you mentioned, our laws do not. So it's not quite apples to apples, but we are mindful of equitable charges for our services. Q What do you see as challenges in the future as we continue with this pandemic?Should it go on another another year or even possibly two? That's a great question. You know, we the state is not giving much guidance as to when we can end moratoriums. In a in a recent memorandum that's coming to you, we plan to end our moratoriums against shutoffs no earlier than June of this year.So with that, you know, as our arrearages continue to grow, you know, we need to try to be mindful of maintaining operations. And it's going to be a balancing act to make sure that we're mindful of hardships to customers but being whole as a as a gas utility.So we'll just move forth cautiously. We're awaiting some assistance from the state in terms of mitigating some of those arrearages. And then when we can finally return to the end of moratorium and. Have a tool to encourage payments will be in a better position to evaluate what total cost of services will be.Okay. Thank you very much. That's all I have there. Council member, Sarah.Thank you, Mayor. So I definitely understand why we need to make sure that we are evaluating if our fees are ensuring that we're breaking pretty much a balance of it being even and not. And but at the same time, it's always hard when we have to increase fees, especially when it's things like and you know, that impactsthe quality of life of our residents that could range from, you know, parking permit, driveway parking permit to, you know, driveway type repaint and all of that. So I'm just wondering how how, how, how, how would we go about making sure that the fees, like some of them, they're increased by almost 50%, if not some higher, andthere's some 82 where it's recommended to lower fee. So I'm just wondering, at what point do you decide, hey, we're going to maybe break those costs out over a number a year? Or like, for example, is it the percent threshold that you say, well, we're going to break them up into two years increment of how we increaseit, 25%, one year and then 25 the next. And I'm just wondering how how would we go about making sure it doesn't impact people kind of kind of shop in the fees changing and also making it kind of palatable for for residents.Well, with regard to the gas fees, yes, Councilwoman Sara, we're very mindful of that. And so any fee that throwback recommended for a substantial increase, we will defer those increases and implement them slowly so as not to be an undue hardship on ratepayers.Some fees we are quite happy to keep at current levels simply because we can maintain operations at those subvention levels. But where we are massively under collective, we do need to slowly roll in. So to better. Manage the cost of our services.Thank you. What about public works? Is that similar or because there's there's a lot of things here that might. You know, removing certain things that you in the city like in front of businesses as well. I'm just wondering, is that the same approach to.It is the same approach. Yes. And as far as implementing over a period of time, specifically for a couple of those items that you mentioned, the the curb painting and the the other items there, we are facing those in over a period of three years.So it'll be one third each year over the next three years, which would then get us to two whole in year three moving forward.Yeah, because I didn't realize there was 175 per location and then it would be increased to 325 just to do a painting, a driveway like painting the red. Right, kind of red, what you call red tips, right?Yeah, that's correct. So the study takes into account all of the efforts to actually get out there and do it, including the labor and the materials. The existing fee is currently 175 for the driveway tips and the repaint is 87.So the RCC study did recommend a higher fee to recover those costs, but we do understand it was a pretty significant increase and therefore our phasing it in over the three year period.And thank you so much.Thank you. I have council member Austin. Thank you so much for the presentation and I do understand, you know, the need and I do I think we need to be smarter as a city in terms of, you know, recuperating our our cost for poor services.At the same time, I'm also mindful of the fact that we are not for profit entity. And many of the services that we provide as a city will never bring the cost for. And that is that that goes along with public works and our gas and energy, energy and gas departments, but with several other departments as well. I am. And I guess it may be lost on some, but for me I'm concerned. Any time we're talking about raising rates or fees on the gas, the increase in gas fees for services has me a little concerned because of where we are right now with the the the rates going up and increasing literally.At the same time, I think to to councilmember sorrows point, you know, children are concerned about the impacts on our our lower income residents and those seniors who are on fixed incomes and who are being challenged with those of.The rising price of natural gas. But also, you know, now the city is is looking at raising fees for various services. And so, you know, I would ask that we would be doing very, very well with extreme caution here and being very sensitive to the those of those individuals who we all represent, say senior citizens, low incomefamilies who would be impacted by by these fees, rates and or fee increases. Also wanted to. And I. Raise this issue with the city manager a little earlier. But I think it's worthy, too, for a public discussion here.You know, some of the services that our public works department provides are obviously indirect services to businesses and residents. But, you know, we as city council members, we may get a complaint. We may be responding to a constituent request or just a notice, for example, you know, painting curves in a business district.Right. Anything, you know, of green curves. Of red curves. These are these are things that we don't necessarily you know, they're not celebrated and talked about. The city council members have to be attentive to those those issues, particularly in support of our our businesses, communities and where it relates to the safety of it in those those areas. My question to the city staff is how if a city council office would request those type of services, are we going to be charged to see a budget that we may control for such fees? Or is it coming from somewhere else?Can't remember. This is Eric Lopez. I know you won't be charged. We still have our regular maintenance crews that do street maintenance that will handle some of these requests. This is for either more regular service from, say, an apartment complex or another private property owner.Not for our regular maintenance. So no, you will not get charged for the regular work will still continue repairs incurred in our right away and maintaining them. This is this is just an added an added work to recover some fees for working extra work.Well, thank you for the clarification. It helps a lot, you know, from time to time. You know, Mr. Lopez, you know, we have a request, special request waiting in the alley. Know whatever it may be, sometimes those photos or even of speed bumps.Right. Because those those those are those works. Those come from our our our our district budgets. All right. I just wanted to get some clarification and show that this was a where we were going. So thank you so much for that.Again, like I say, my concerns, you know, please do not take this into account. Are our rate increases or fee increases for for those who are already rate payers or for gas and energy who are lowest income. I think we need to build in some small provisions to account for those type of hardships.Thank you. Councilman. Awesome. Thank you so much for your comments. I just really want to emphasize that of the proposed fee increases, none of them are to individual ratepayers. All of the increases are directed at construction and new development in fee increases.Nothing to that an individual gas ratepayer would incur. I definitely appreciate that clarification. Thank you. If you count on her supernova. Thank you staff for the report. I have kind of a general question and I hope there's a simple answer, but my question is, how do we how did we get to this point?I, I just to foster use the phrase areas where we are massively interconnected. So if we have a city price index, I'm just wondering how we get so far behind. I assume that might be due to regulations that you're subject to.But if there's a simple answer, I would like to hear it.Council member. So our last piece of citywide study that we had was back in 2006. So fast forward to now, it is through this citywide study where we are taking a very close look at our fees and charges and realigning to the cost of service.So it's been some time and even in the interim, we do have the routine processes in place for us to review as well as the city cost index. The city cost index is a general inflator that is applied to all departments, are all applicable fees and of course that's captured across all departments versus this more specific in-depthstudy per department at the service level area.Okay. So if I hear you correctly, it's it's it's the the time passage that has done this. So we 2006, that's a while back. So if we did this on a more regular, consistent basis, we probably wouldn't fall this far behind.That is correct. Councilmember And I do want to note that following the completion of the study, there is a cost of service model that will be available to departments as applicable. And as we move forward, departments will be able to reassess their cost and then also their levels of fees and charges.Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I have Councilmember Allen.Inky so much. I just have a couple of questions. I thank everyone for the presentation. I am with regards to temporary no parking fines. Does that fee change also apply to no parking fines related to neighborhood cleanups or community events?Absolutely. It does not apply. So the idea that it does not apply.Okay, great. Thank you. And then also, Bob, thank you for your your informative presentation. I wanted to ask if your team has looked into subsidizing like home weatherization, like insulating attics or the walls as a way to incentivize gas uses reduction in older homes.I see Bob's on the line, but I can I can answer that question. The short answer is yes. We do have several home efficiency programs that are available offering rebates and in-house services to help customers be more efficient in their consumption of natural gas.Wonderful. Thank you.Thank you. Very public comment. On this report.If there's any members of the public who'd like to speak on this item, please press star nine or use the right hand function. Our first speaker is Dave Shuker.Good evening. Nice to see this agenda. Right after the previous item. Can you hear me? Yes. We hear you. Thank you for confirming. So. We're talking about gas and energy, but not specifically about which utilities other than gas, not electricity, not waste services refuse collection.It'd be nice to only see some more specificity, but how these different institutions relate in the city now specifically calling for a market study for comparisons is a very good idea. And yes, it depends on which particular services the city kind of wants.This is something I think community choice aggregations as well as the DWP. I mean, there's different models, but more integrated models are just better for, you know, deployment. They're they're more effective. They're faster, more responsive. The community owned and controlled the city owns its own assets.It's something I got to keep telling you until we're entirely corporatized. Um. What else? Oh, yeah. So, what are the big things that I wanted to say on this item when I first read it last night was that I'd like to see some dark sky principles for our city lighting and city contracts with lighting.Look at Pittsburgh as a comparison. It works for safety. It works for cost. It works for the environment. There's a lot of things in the city that we could do. But again, you know, we need to. We need to we need to do so.Here is an immediate truth and reconciliation freebie. It's not a rape, nor is it a read. A real estate investment trust. Moderate. But you could restructure measure U.S.. To be in line with signal. That's that there was a missed opportunity.Putting it indexing it to the consumer price index instead of the producer price index. And that would more than double the money, especially now that we're going to have a period of ramp up in the markets, even though we shouldn't.With oil and gas, this is the year. Ladies and gentlemen, science tells us we should stop oil and gas. Period. So every moment that you delay is something that you know you're doing wrong. And it's important to say that on the record.But yeah, you know, if we're going to keep using oil, tax it properly and let us use those moneys properly. Thank you.That concludes public comment for this item.Thank you.

Do you have any comments on that?He. Good evening. I'm Julian Boyer. I am substituting for Elena Adair, your finance director, for the three weeks that she's on vacation. This item comes before you each year to adopt new fees or to improve the fees that have been on the list.And each year, they are increased by either the CPI or the building building index. So I've checked the fees. They comply with that. There are a few new fees, not very many, but there are the fees that are new are in the Community Development Planning section and they are actually for a smaller entity.So a bigger entity had a higher deposit, smaller entity, lower deposit and there are three of them and they appear on pages 33 and 34.May I just ask for clarification, Ms. BOYER So CPI would be Consumer Price Index?That's correct. I'm sorry. Yes. It's one of those terms that you just get so used to saying that you forget. And then there was one fee that was removed from the list that's on page four and is in the police department and Alcoholic Beverage Control License approval.And, and it was originally a $50 fee, and it applied only in our case to nonprofit organizations that got a one day license. And the chief of police recommended that we move that fee to zero, since it's a signature only.And what we were charging was removing fundraising efforts from the nonprofit. So that fee has been proposed to be reduced from 50 to 0. Those are the only real major changes. There are some minor wording changes, but not in the fees themselves.The language changes were to be clarify and be more descriptive. And that makes it easier for staff to apply and for the public to understand what the fee is. Staff members who participated in creating this fee resolution are in the audience and would be available to answer questions.Should you have any?Very good. Are there any questions, comments from council members?ASHCROFT Thank you. I think there was some clarification that the means for assessing penalties on overdue business license fee. Do you want to explain that?Well, we didn't include that in this document. The that is actually included in the municipal code. And so Ms..

Um, Councilwoman Kinch, will you please put 129 on the floor?Yes, Council President. I move that council bill 18 dash 0129 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.All right. It has been moved. And second it a public hearing for 1 to 9 is open. We have the staff report council.Do I have my presentation?Counseling. Counseling?Sorry. I'm looking for Amanda. Where is she? There she is. Sorry, guys. We'll get started here in a second. Yeah. Load up.You want to do an intro for us?This is the slot home moratorium. The Council bill 129. Am I just there? Oh, sorry. I know what I'm supposed to do.What?I was floundering. Okay, let me do this officially the.Way I see it.You don't have to do that. Council can do it that you can just. Yeah, you can go right into the bill.All right. I wanted to just go through the presentation. This is slightly abbreviated for some of you who have been part of Rudy committee. This is going to be a little bit redundant. So before I get started, I just want to acknowledge the importance of Councilman Wayne New, whose building form development is on your desk.Councilman, news efforts on the misuse of the garden court, much like what we were just talking about, resulted in the moratorium that we're about to consider coming forth, because his work and the collective actions of this Council have advanced the creation and work of the slot Home Task Force, which is a group of very capable individuals fromall sort of walks of Denver that have tried to tackle the difficulty, difficult challenges that slot home to present. Anyway, the task force has made many recommendations that this Council will consider for adoption later this spring. But is the task force last recommendation that is before you tonight?That recommendation called for a faster end to the use of existing form standards used to create slot homes while a solution is advanced. The slot home moratorium is a means to an end in preparation for potential changes that the task force believes will greatly improve the detrimental aspects of side by side attached dwelling units.The purpose of the proposed bill is to place a moratorium on the approved the approval of site development plans, otherwise called steps for side by side attached dwelling unit projects. Formal SDP applications that are eligible for approval once the moratorium is active have until 4:30 p.m. on November 10th of 2018 to be approved using the existing zoningstandards. The moratorium shall expire upon the adoption. Next slide, please. The moratorium shall expire upon the adoption of the slot Home Text Amendment or June 4th, 2018, whichever occurs earlier. As you know, slot homes are derivatives of many different building forms in Denver's form based zoning code.The forms that are used to create smart homes today include Row, House, Townhouse, Apartment General and Shop One Shopfront Building Form Standards. And fortunately, through a combination of previously adopted text amendments and the current garden court moratorium, the use of the duplex and garden court forms to achieve unintended developments have has already been ended.The proposed site Home Moratorium specifically addresses the remaining building form standards so you can go to the next slide. So highlighted in yellow are the remaining building form standards where projects characterize this lot of homes can be built.The building forms that the moratorium addresses specifically are the townhouse row house, apartment general and shopfront building forms. In part due to concerns expressed by this committee during its November or not. This Committee, the committee during its November slot, Home Task Force Braking Briefing.The task force in January reconsidered its implementation recommendations. The task force voted unanimously, unanimously to put forward the following recommendation. The task force chose to keep. And I apologize for the slide. Hopefully the task force chose to keep its prior recommendation that was presented at that ludi meeting for a November 10th approval deadline.Cognizant of the expressed desires to have both additional STP approval time and earlier in an earlier end to the creation of slot homes, the task force agreed to recommend a proposed earlier stop date to the acceptance of the steps at the time in mid-January.It was unclear how soon that could occur, but the intent was as soon as possible. Working with staff, we determined that the moratorium is the appropriate means to achieve the task force recommendation, and that is what's up for consideration tonight.So. So as of right now and as of the last week in January, early first week of February, CPD has and will review and provide comment based on the new on the proposed urban townhouse standards, which is going to be what's used going forward.If sorry. However, completed reviews will not be approved until the urban townhouse form is adopted, which is anticipated in May. The approach of allowing developers to begin reviewing under proposed standards is similar to what we had done for the for 38th in Blake when it was being proposed for the incentive and design overlays currently.So at some projects may be submitted right now and could have for the last month and a half using the new standards even though they're not able to be approved. So during this moratorium, the Slide Home Text Amendment will follow.The normal adoption sequence has shown in normal adoption sequence and schedule mean. Planned for a council hearing as soon as May 7th. It is that May 7th date that then establishes the the end of the. In the end date of November 10th of 2018.On when. Well, actually, you know that that establishes the end date of November 10th on when the approval process. I may have gotten that. Eligible projects mean. Sorry, I'm confused by my own language. The last day for. Uh.Scratch that.So. So I just. For those that are paying attention. I'm talking about two different things. So the slot home moratorium is effective as soon as it's executed upon to the council tonight and the slot home test text amendment which will result in that urban townhouse standard which you can submit and review under.Won't be available until council for actual approval. Until Council adopted in May.Things. Sorry.Okay. We have no speakers signed up for this, so I'm going to go into questions. Members of council, um, and actually councilman new do you want to chime in here as a kind of co-sponsor on this?Yeah, it was, it was a very collaborative process, really appreciate and at least the leadership in committees leadership on this and the attorneys recommending the moratorium for us for this two month until the new criteria is developed and finished and approved.So we're we were real pleased. It was it was like Councilman Espinosa said, we had a well-rounded committee and we went through a lot of discussion and it was a very collaborative process. And so it was very interesting to hear all the different perspectives and and through the real deals and after we came up with some actualcriteria. So I really appreciate all the work that we did and I think we've got something very good in there will be coming forward in the next cycle. Planning Board should have CRC and Planning Board and so it'll coming up to Louie again and then the approval process coming in May.So we're looking forward to it. I think you'll be pleased when you see the new criteria. Thank you. Mr..All right. Thank you, Councilman. New members of Council. Question. And I'll just just start off off for the edification of folks who were not able to tune into the committee meeting and ask maybe and a Elise to come up to the podium real quick.And just Councilman, you just talked about the collaboration with CPD on on this effort. Obviously, this is an effort put forth, you know, by the councilman. Just want to make sure from Speedy's perspective, it was unanimous. I heard from my constituent, Maggie Miller, that it was unanimous to move this forward.But from Cbd's perspective, you all are supportive, etc..Yeah, and I spoke with Community Planning and Development, senior city planner leading this Home Tax Amendment and evaluation project. Historically, CBD has not taken a position on moratoriums, but we're willing to provide the technical support to ensure that the task force recommendation does move forward with support of the council members.Okay. So you're not opposing it?That is correct.All right. The other question is, you know, there's been a lot of question of who in the pipeline gets to get their project done. And so I know there are several individuals who are in the pipeline. So can you just explain that again?And I know Councilman talked about it just for a second, but if you can explain it, I'd be great.Absolutely. So what this moratorium aims to do is to allow for projects that were submitted prior to the 14th of this month to continue under the existing regulations. That is what is currently adopted under the Denver zoning code, which does allow for a slight outcome.And those projects will have until November ten to complete and gain approval under those existing regulations. So in that pipeline, there's approximately 30, maybe a little bit more projects we can expect to see be approved in that pipeline project.And kind of that was an important compromise that I think we heard in Ludy as well as from the task force, is that we stopped this as soon as possible. But people who have already made significant investment and invested into the formal process, it was important that they were allowed to continue forward.Okay. So these 30 projects that are in that formal step will not be a part of the new design standards and guidelines that will be coming through planning board. When will it become into the planning?Yeah. So they'll be going to planning board on May 21st and then becoming the City Council for full consideration on May 7th. They absolutely have the opportunity to adhere to the new standards, but they are not required to do so.Okay. Thank you. Very helpful. All right. Seeing no other questions by members of council. We're going to. No. Yep. We're going to close the public hearing 129 and go to comments by members of Council. Councilman Espinosa, you want to make a comment?Yeah, I just wanted to explain. Was flustered and I had to look at my own bill to understand it. So I got when the task force made its recommendation in November, we ended up circling around November 10th. That was based on six months from a, you know, projected adoption date.And I, I got confused myself that, yes, it is, in fact, hardcoded in this moratorium that these existing SDP approved steps have to be done by November 10th, even if council doesn't adopt the if even if the urban townhouse text, it means thought home text amendment, urban townhouse form gets at all delayed.So it's a bit of a detailed nuance, but it is hardcoded in this moratorium that the existing city approved steps have until. Um, formal steps not approved. Sorry. I should have looked at Annalise.I think we got it.She explained it.Is that it, Councilman?Yeah. I shouldn't play CPD planner on TV. Thanks. Oh, actually, but I do want to comment. I just on Elise's has been you know, she actually wasn't the the leader of the task force at the time it started, but took it over quickly thereafter and has run with it and just done an incredible job leading that groupto two solutions and compromises. And we'll talk more about that. You know, as the as the Urban Townhouse Forum comes to council, but even on this thing, this was this was, you know, the conversation that council had at LUDI was an interesting one.And it presented some challenges that she led that discussion and navigated it so well that the developer, a developer from the development side, is the one that actually proposed this idea that we're of this early in date and it won unanimous support in the end, which I don't think was an outcome that anyone would have necessarily predictedwhen we entered the room. So it's been great. Thanks.Okay. Oh, Councilman. No, go.Ahead. One last thing. And it also we really emphasized to the developers with these 30 projects, if they could use the new criteria, we should really, really encourage them to do that is it's going to be an excellent improvement to that building form.And we just really want to just encourage them to use the new criteria.

She's going to go ahead and do the presentation on her screen.Okay.Is this an openness?It meets all the requirements. I mean.Okay.All right.Here. Okay. So 4402 Umatilla Street proposal is to rezone from a former Chapter 59 PD number 358 to urban context. Main Street two storey height limit. Property is in Council District one in the Sunnyside neighborhood. Just at the corner of 44th and Umatilla, the northwest corner south of I-70, east of Federal Boulevard, west of Chaffee Park.I'm sorry. I'm not saying that I'm moving the slides. I am now on request. It was three slides in. It's force of habit. Property is about 12,000 square feet or nearly a third of an acre. It is an existing office sort of industrial use.Property owner is requesting to redevelop the property, add some height, repurpose the existing building, add a new building. So again, the the request is to reason from 8358 to urban context. Main Street two storey. And I'm moving on to the urban neighborhood context.This is a context that has similar use uses to the B to zone districts, which was the basis of the PD commercial land uses and small scale embedded in the neighborhoods, single family and multi-unit primarily located on local or collector streets and multi-unit along mixed use arterials or main streets.And so it is in the urban context and regular pattern of square blocks or rectangular blocks with or without alleys. So again, this is a former Chapter 59 PD. There is also on the property a it's within a view plane, the 51st Avenue and soon a street view plane, which is protecting a view of downtown from thepark at 51st and Zuni. The allowable building height would be 59 to 61 feet, and so would not affect this property because the two storey height limit is way below that. So again, the it's an existing industrial warehouse land use.The PD, the terms of the PD restrict the gross floor area built on the property to about 6000 square feet. The height limit is 25 feet. There are, as I said before, the PD was based on the beat, the old B two zone district, which was a neighborhood serving zone district.So the PD also added a few more intense land, uses special trades, contractor assembly and fabrication, wholesale and retail sales repair, renting and servicing and parking and commercial storage of vehicles. And the PD excluded adult business and single and multi-unit land uses.So I'm moving on to existing context zoning. The we see the existing PD surrounding on the north and east is urban main street two zoning to the south, urban to unit zoning and to the West urban main street to ex zoning.And then to land use existing context. It is an existing one storey building. There are adjacent commercial on either side of 44th Avenue and then adjacent to low density residential land uses on the north and south and then existing context building form and scale slide.These pictures give you an idea of the context we're talking about. The building itself is on the upper right. Another commercial building to the east on the lower right. Duplex across 44th Avenue. On the bottom. Duplex just north of the site on the top.And then another commercial building to the west on the left. So moving on to the process. Notice of receipt of application went out in May of this year. Planning Board heard this on July 20th and by a vote of 8 to 0 recommended approval plan committee saw this on August 16th.And of course, we're here tonight. All of these meetings had the proper public notice and sign postings, as has tonight's meeting. These are the general neighborhood organizations that were notified today. We have no comment letters on this application.So moving on to review criteria, you know this well, consistency with adopted plans. Uniformity of district regulations. Furthering the public health, safety and welfare. Justifying circumstances. Consistency with neighborhood context and zone. District purpose and intent. Review Criteria. The plans that apply our Comprehensive Plan 2000 Blueprint Denver and the Sunnyside Neighborhood Plan, which was adopted in 1992.So consistency with adopted plans. The Comprehensive Plan. Consistency with adopted plans for a comprehensive plan is detailed in your staff report, so I skipped that one. We are on Blueprint Denver. The land use concept is pedestrian shopping corridor, which are these neighborhoods serving areas which are low scaled compatible with the surrounding residential neighborhoods, similar in land useto our town centers, but definitely lower in scale. And this is property is in an area of change, which is of course where we want to direct the majority of our growth. Moving on to Blueprint Denver Future Street classification, Umatilla Street is an undesignated locale.West 44th Avenue is a residential collector, and the collector is a balance between mobility and access to the properties and local is more focused on access to properties. So. The Sunnyside Neighborhood Plan. Next slide is has a land use goal of maintaining and stabilizing the residential character of the neighborhood and encouraging small scale shops and offices, particularlyin commercial zones along 44th Avenue and Tyrone that would advance and serve the neighborhood. And in their design guidelines for 44th Avenue. They definitely want to discourage auto related or liquor licenses, but encourage development of small scale, neighborhood serving business and small offices and in an economic development recommendation.The plan states we should work towards a goal of concentrated commercial nodes rather than scattered site development. All of the commercial so under review criteria for consistency with adopted plan staff believes this criteria is met by zoning out of a custom zone district to a standard zoned district.We believe we're furthering the uniformity of district regulations citywide, and by implementing our plans, we believe we are furthering the vision for the neighborhood and furthering the public health, safety and welfare. So under justifying circumstances for review criteria, the criteria, the circumstance justifying circumstances changed conditions.The land or its surrounding environs has changed or is changing to a degree that it's in the public interest to encourage redevelopment of the area or recognize the changed character of the area. Property owners cites this as a high profile location with changing conditions and the obsolescence of this.Chapter 59 PD staff believes that changing this building from light industrial to commercial, that is neighborhood serving commercial and implementing the plan and furthering the reinvestment in this in this property is a justified correct is a justifying circumstance for the proposed rezoning.We did talk a little bit about the urban context, single two unit small scale multi-unit commercial land use is usually embedded and the block shapes that are uniform and in a grid street system. The Zone District is intended to promote safe, active, pedestrian scaled commercial and staff believes that this zone district is the appropriate, that this proposalconforms with that. So with that, staff recommends that all of the criteria are met and we do recommend approval.Thank you, Ms.. Lucero. All right. We have one speaker tonight. Ben Gearhart, you have 3 minutes. Good evening.Counsel. Her name's Ben.Gearhart. I'm a resident at 3931 Julian Street. I'm here to answer any questions, so. Yeah.Thank you. Thank you. All right. That concludes our speakers. Do we have any questions from members of council? Right. But we're hearing from Council Bill three, four, two, one is close comments for members of Council Councilman Espinosa. Now, I just want to thank Ben and the applicant and the CBD, but Ben, for taking the time to bothtalk with my office and with the community, the R.A. and the Pcdi there and having a good dialog before you pursued the eventual application, because I think this is a very sensitive community to the development. There's a certain ethos there, like there are in many other parts of Northwest Denver, and here it's still intact.And so I think they'd love to see neighborhoods serving businesses. I think you're you're proposing to bring in your development capacity, certainly would allow that. And but to be mindful of that community. And thus far, you have been.So I just hope that that continues as if you pursue any future licensing or anything else along that line. But I do appreciate you being willing to have that dialog dialog with the community. Thank you. Thank you. I will be supporting this rezoning.Thanks. Great. Any other comments by members of council? Madam Secretary, roll call.Espinosa. Hi. Flynn. Hi. Gilmore. Herndon. I can. I can eat. Lopez. Ortega.

I'll do a quick recap. Under resolutions, Councilman Sawyer has called out Resolutions 1073 and 1074 for questions under bills, for introduction. No items have been called out under bills for final consideration. No items have been called out and under pending.No items have been called out. Madam Secretary, would you please put the first items on our screen? And, Councilman Sawyer. Go ahead with your questions.Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to just be talked to the airport quickly about these two oil and gas contracts. I just want to clarify a couple of things, if you guys don't mind. Thank you.Hi. Rachel Marion, director of government affairs for Denver International Airport. Hi. Thanks.Thanks for coming tonight. I appreciate it. Just wanted to we sort of went through this in committee, but I just want to make sure for everyone watching at home this evening that we just clarify exactly what's going on with these contracts and what's happening as they come through.So can you just kind of talk a little bit about what these contracts are and what they're doing?Sure. So we currently have 76 oil and gas wells on airport property, most of which existed prior to the airport being built on that land. And what these contracts do are they fulfill our environmental and safety regulatory obligations.So checking on them daily to ensure that that leaks aren't happening and then responding in the case of any sort of emergency. What these contracts do not do is enable any sort of oil and gas production at the airport.Okay. And so the requirements that are in place, we are. Can you just explain we are required to have these contracts. In place.Sure. So on the federal level, we have Environmental Protection Agency, EPA requirements. At the state level, we have code CC, which is the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission requirements. And we also have Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment requirements with regard to all of our existing oil and natural gas wells.Okay. And so as long as we keep any oil wells that could potentially go back to being active, we are required to maintain these these contracts as active. Is that true? Correct. Okay. And so these contracts are for how long?The contracts are for three years with two one year extensions. One of the contracts, the existing contract expires at the end of this month. The other expires in December. So we're bringing them on to the same schedule. But it's three years with two one year extension options.Okay, great. And so there's just to clarify then there's no option for us to have these contracts not continue forward. We're required to have these in order to maintain these 76 wells on the airport land.Correct. So these contracts are necessary for us to meet our environmental and safety regulatory requirements as required by federal and state regulation.Okay, perfect. Thank you very much for clarifying. I really appreciate your time.Thank you. Thank you.Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilwoman, to our Councilman Hines.Thank you, Mr. President. Hello. Hi. How are you doing?Great. How are you?I'm all right. Thanks for coming. So I have a few questions. So there was one example last. So the last actually couple of questions. When was the last time we extracted anything from these wells?All of our wells have been shut in since May of 2018.Okay. And there was one instance of a leak identified between May of 2018 and today. Is that correct?Correct.No more than one.No more than one. And then prior to the leak that happened earlier this year, the most recent leak was in 2014.And do you know how much leaked in the in that the 20. The one the recent one?I do not I do know that as a result of these contracts, we were immediately responsive and there were no incidents of environmental contamination after the leak was identified and remediated.Okay. How much would it cost to permanently close? I'm sorry. There's 76 wells. Four or five have been permanently closed. Is that right?We're in the process of the the correct term is plugging and abandoning. So we're in the process of plugging and abandoning five wells this year.Okay. And how much would it cost to plug and abandon all wells?The most recent estimate we have is $9 million to plug in, abandon all of the wells.Okay. Final question. I asked you this and I'll ask you again. If you if the if ten does choose to consider resuming production from any of these wells. You will give us the opportunity to discuss that in advance.Is that correct?Yes, absolutely. Okay.Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilman Hinds. All right. Seeing no other questions on that item. That concludes the items to be called out this evening. Our bills for introduction are ordered published. We are now ready for the block vote on resolutions and bills on final consideration.Council members remember that this is a consent or block vote and you will need to vote. Otherwise, this is your last chance to call an item out for a separate vote. Councilman Sandoval, will you please put the resolutions for adoption and the bills on final consideration for final passage on the floor?I move that resolutions be adopted in bills and confine on final consideration, be placed placed upon final consideration, and do passed in a block for the following items.

This agenda item and the next agenda item were just I do it for the approval of the city budget as a whole. Just like in previous years, I intend to vote no on the budget, even more so than in previous years.This year's budget is an austerity budget, a budget based on the interests of big business, which makes further cuts to the needs of working people and the services they rely on. Every year since I first took office in 2014.We have built a people's budget movement to fight for progressive changes to Seattle's but business as usual budget. And every year our movement wins important victories that make a real material difference in the lives of regular people. On November 7th this year, we held an inspiring people's budget town hall on affordable housing at the Yes Community Center. And I want to thank the activists and the organizations, including labor unions, that made that such a powerful event. And I've had the courage to fight back against this austerity budget. As a representative of working people, it is my job to talk openly about the realities and challenges and setbacks we face.Our movement faces and to not define things. We have to be clear about what is happening in the movement for affordable housing. Last summer, when Amazon issued its threats and big business fought back against having to pay even the modest tax, the Amazon tax, the majority of the council marched in step behind the chamber's drum and betrayedworking people by repealing the Amazon tax in a quintessential backroom deal. They robbed the movement in Seattle of the right to fight it out at the ballot box. To answer big business lies by going to the doors of working people around the city.Fortunately, in several other cities around the country. The talk of taxing big business to address the growing national affordable housing crisis was carried forward, inspired in part by the tax Amazon movement here in Seattle, in California, San Francisco, East Palo Alto and Mountain View.All put big business taxes on the ballot and in some cases, far bigger ones than we had in Seattle. And in every city, they passed by large margins here in Seattle, I promise you, we will be we will continue to fight to tax Amazon and big business to fund housing for working people, our people's budget movement.One important victories this year. Thanks to our collective organizing, it is important to recognize these victories of social movements, even though they are less than what is needed, because they underscore an essential message that when we organize and fight back, we can win.The LGBTQ community did fantastic organizing and won funding for LGBTQ senior services to backfill the trans services, funding unacceptably cut by the mayor, and funding for the LGBTQ Health and Wellness Center at Noble High School. The People's Budget Movement Activism made sure that the residents of share and real shelters can continue to keep their shelters open thisyear, despite the ongoing IT terms of the establishment to shut it down. And I don't think we've seen the end of it. This is the second year in a row that the mayor tried to close their doors, driving them to the streets.And this is the second year that they have organized and that we are one we successfully won the first ever eviction. City funded eviction. Defense attorney to help Seattle residents facing evictions to defend their rights. This is an important precedent and we will be back to fight for more attorneys so that in the ongoing assault against tenantrights, where the rampant evictions in this city, working people have access to legal help, we need to fund the right to counsel so no one is expected to go to eviction court unprepared. And we will be pushing next year to overhaul the predatory tenant eviction system.Renters have far more right in eviction court in other cities and states, and that needs to change. Here in Seattle, the indigenous community finally won stable funding for the annual Indigenous People's Day celebration. Our movement has fought for this every year since we first forced the establishment to end Columbus Day and create Indigenous Peoples Day in 2014. And this time we have won the funding in an hour movement one funding for many other things that will make a real difference in people's lives. We also won what are called statements of legislative intent to continue to push forward the process of creating a public bank in Seattle and to demand progress from the mayor in choosinga location for a safe consumption site. But while all these victories by our movement were important on the burning crisis of affordable housing facing working people, the establishment was completely unwilling to match its flowery rhetoric with action. When she delivered her State of the City address in February, Mayor Durkan said, quote, Our first priority, though, must beto build a more affordable Seattle. Number one, we have to build more low income and middle class housing as quickly as we can. End quote. But the reality is those words are a lie. Building code, more low income and middle class housing, unquote, was not the mayor's number one priority.It was not her number two priority or even her number one priority. It was less than 1% of the budget that she proposed for affordable housing, and that included only funds that legally could go nowhere else. Not one new dollar was proposed for affordable housing by Mayor Austerity Durkan.And we have to be honest. The majority of the Council has also completely failed to do anything substantially different. The people's budget movement put forward 11 different options to fund building, more affordable housing, and made it clear that we would support other ideas also.The majority of the council voted down all of them while proposing no alternatives. The majority of the council voted against funding affordable housing again and again and again. They would not authorize a bond for affordable housing. They use bonds again and again to benefit big business approved projects in addition to the billions of state funds to digthe tunnel. They are investing hundreds of millions of city funds to build the waterfront, to make millions for the big developers and increase property values of super wealthy people downtown. But they will not bond for housing. They refuse to bring back the Amazon tax.This is not surprising, but neither did they put forward any alternative ways to tax big business or the rich in this increasingly unequal city in this state which has the most aggressive tax system in the nation. But the burden of taxes falls overwhelmingly on working people instead of on the richest man in the world and his billionairefriends. They would not fund affordable housing with revenue from not opening a new big business tax loophole for Big Pharma's drug research. They prioritize spending 1 million on studying how to create new downtown street tolls, which are yet another regressive tax.Instead of using that money for affordable housing, they funded sweeping homeless encampments on one corner to another, rather than using those funds to build affordable housing. In fact, we have now heard most councilmembers extoll the virtues of the euphemistically named navigation team with zero evidence.After hundreds of sweeps last year and hundreds every year before that, the city has failed to provide evidence of even one person transition to permanent housing by the navigation team. They measure every other homeless service based on transitions to permanent housing or even hygiene services, which are only meant to provide shower, bathroom and laundry services to homelesspeople so that they have a lifeline to be able to get to their jobs, are asked to drag their transitions to permanent housing. But the sweeps, which are 100% about moving people are never asked where do people actually go and how many get permanent housing?Council members talk about data and in the same breath they support the sweeps with zero data. Councilmembers talk about race and social justice initiative, which is based on asking affected. Community is what is needed. But then they ignored what we have never heard one single homeless person say, which is that the navigation team actually helped them getpermanent housing. In my committee we have heard testimony from someone who has been swept eight times. It has been such a cruel and ineffective waste of money, but councilmembers would not support using these funds for affordable housing instead, which is the real solution to homelessness.We proposed funding affordable housing by collecting the costs of staffing special events. Council members voted no. Council members voted against redirecting funds to affordable housing instead of prioritizing new computers in police cars. Council members voted against capping city executive salaries or reducing the number of city executives, or slowing police hiring to fund affordable housing.Council members voted against reducing their own salaries to the area median income of $17,200 in order to fund some affordable housing. In fact, when there was money left over from the balancing during the Budget Committee meeting last Wednesday, council members voted against using that extra money for affordable housing.Budget Chair Bagshaw said that at that time that she suspected Gordon there would be another need for that funding and so she couldn't support using it for affordable housing. In other words, this political establishment has spent interminable hours talking about affordable housing, but those words could not be more empty.This budget increases the police budget by over $70 million, but it cannot find $1 more for affordable housing. We need to be crystal clear the housing crisis in Seattle is not because of a lack of ideas or creativity.This crisis is purely a result of a lack of political will to stand up against Amazon and big business. The political establishment has made it clear working class people are not welcome in Seattle. If you are Amazon, if you are downtown real estate interests, Seattle will give you whatever investment you want paid for with the ever increasingregressive property and sales taxes on working people. But if you are a hard working Seattle struggling to pay rent, they are happy to push you out of your home, your neighborhood, and possibly out of the city. Remember, not only as homelessness continued to rise, but for working renters that are housed, almost half are rent burdened who aremaking ever greater sacrifices in other aspects of their lives to be able to stay housed. So like in previous years, our people's budget movement one important victories. But big business interests continue to dominate the large swaths of the city budget.What we are able to win depends entirely on the strength of our movements. That is why the same council voted against the Amazon tax first, then in favor of it, then repealed it all in the course of a few months.Their votes were not based on facts or evidence or data. Their votes were certainly not based on principles. They were being pushed by the balance of power in society between big business and the affordable housing movement. When the movement has a greater balance of power, then we will see the right votes.The way will push them back again is by building our movement. 50 years ago, Martin Luther King Jr said, quote, If our nation can spend $35 billion a year to fight an unjust, evil war in Vietnam and 20 billion to put a man on the moon, it can spend billions of dollars to put God's children on thereto feed right here on Earth and quote his words from 1967 are, if anything, more meaningful today in a city. But a single billionaire is financing his own spaceships. While thousands of people have been driven into homelessness, have overflowed their shelters and are living on the streets.We did not win a people's budget today, but we are building the sort of movement that can win one in the future. And I am proud and honored to be part of that movement. This movement is not limited to Seattle either.It is building in other cities also, including in Queens, New York, where working people are right now protesting in their outrage at the sweetheart deals given to Jeff Bezos, while New York housing and its transportation infrastructure are in crisis.I also want to thank central staff director Kirsten Armistead and her staff Greg Dawes, Don Edo, Patricia Lee, Ali Banerjee. Asha Benko Drummond. Lisa Kay, Tracey Ratcliffe, Adam Lee, Eric Son. Brian. Goodnight, Jeff Sims and Kelvin Zhao, who all were directly instrumental in helping my office prepare the budget amendment.Particularly, I want to thank them for putting together the 11 different amendments with 11 different ways to fund affordable housing, which can seem like a thankless task, particularly when the majority of the council rejects all of them. However, I want general staff to know your work has given hundreds of regular people throughout Seattle a concrete solution tothe affordable housing crisis to fight for and to also show that it is not this or that technicality that the Democratic establishment objected to. It is the very idea of standing up against big business by taking action on the housing crisis.And we have seen that while we have won some things today, even the budget amendments we lose are a starting point for people to organize to win changes in the future. Like happened with the Amazon tax last budget.So thank you all again for everything you do. Let's keep building this movement. Thanks to all the hundreds of working people who came together this year to fight for a people's budget. You have collectively, yet again, set an example for working people around the country fighting for an alternative to austerity, inequality and the bankruptcy of corporate politics. I will vote no on this austerity budget today.Three. Thank you. Cancer Research Council member Beck Shaw as chair. Would you like to say a few words?Good. Thank you so much. Thank you again, all of you, for being here. I want to talk a little bit about the budget that we balanced, and it's taken us a couple of months to get here. But it reflects our collective commitment to invest in areas that we believe need our attention most.And we did this with revenues that we have in hand, those that were estimated to come in. And our balanced budget is focused on making our city a safer and more welcoming place for everybody who is in Seattle.And while we've taken many steps to accomplish these goals, what we all know is that we're going to have to have sustained efforts in 2019 to implement what we're doing and to really look at the regional housing that we've been talking about.So when I started off with this budget, I identified what available revenue sources we had so that we didn't overcommit or that we didn't expend money in areas where we couldn't continue next year and into 2020. I really wanted to focus on an action oriented budget as well, which meant I didn't want us to be spending moneyon more plans that we'd already been planning. Let's build on what we already know and get some things done. We identified individual council members, top requests and their values, and I did what I could to make sure that people were able to get and to put in for their own districts or their own most important items themoney that they needed to accomplish their goals. And also, I wanted to prioritize, and we did the kind of coordinated investments that we can make with King County and with our other counties going forward. So I've got a number of thank you that I want to make, but I do want to just express that through this budgetwe have managed to expand services for our most vulnerable populations, things like treatment on demand and services to address substance abuse abuse disorders. Many of you have heard me talk over the years about wanting to have expanded buprenorphine systems, places where people could get methadone.We have organizations like Evergreen Treatment that will now have more money and resources and more capital money. We're also going to be reforming our criminal legal system. And I want to express my thanks first to Councilmember Gonzales, who's been my vice chair throughout this.But working with her over the next year, there will be a lot of things that we can do where we're coordinating with our municipal courts, with our city attorney, with our prosecuting attorneys, with our defenders. There is much that we already know, but the coordinated effort is something that's going to not only save us money, keep morepeople out of jail, and make sure that we are providing to individuals the services and the help that they need. I also want to extend my thanks for the help in improving some of the systems that we have identified specifically.One of my top goals this this year, which we have managed to accomplish, is to create a low acuity response team. And this was something that we modeled off other cities Colorado Springs, Mesa, Arizona, for example, have what they they call a care program.What we're going to be doing is responding and helping our first responders to people who are chronically ill. Those people who are oftentimes on our streets or were calling or the people are calling on their behalf over and over again, whether they have behavioral health or mental health problems or chronic illnesses, rather than sending out multiple laddertrucks, multiple ambulances. We can have a system set up to ensure coordinated and effective responses that were our first responders with behavioral and mental health folks can arrive in something less than ladder trucks, but with the supplies that they need to be helpful.I also want to acknowledge that we have increased funding for mental health outreach, our expanded treatment for individuals with substance use disorders. We made whole the navigation team. I want to say thank you right in advance, Councilmember Mosquito for working with me on that.We have made sure that the 217 beds were protected, the additional beds for emergency shelter. From the beginning we agreed that that was not going to be cut and we have some additional day center work. And I want to acknowledge that we have additional services that will help Native American and Alaska Native women.More on that in a moment. So also, we have made some great capital improvements in neighborhood investments, such as in South Park that Councilmember Herbold had brought up. And again, something I'm excited about for 2019 is a child care facility.We put $100,000 into the budget to make sure we've got a child care center here at City Hall that will be dedicated first for our city employees and open to the public if there's spaces left. I'm anxious to.2019 to make sure that that happens. I also want to say thank you to my Parks Department, Christopher Williams and crew who are here. Thanks for your good help around the U.S. or Crescent. The help that we have for some additional capital money to really make some effective safety health and just really public vitality improvements between cityhall and the courthouse next door and then towards Pioneer Square. And really, before I get into individual thank you. I want to acknowledge what I really believe is that we've made some important investment here that are going to improve people's lives.But in no way do we have the ample resources that we need to make that big jump. In part what councilmembers want just talked about. I believe that we need to make significant investments in our regional programs as well, that the city taxpayers cannot do it all by ourselves.But we need to coordinate with the county and with our other cities within King County. Mayor Durkan has already gotten this started. A number of our council colleagues, including Councilmember Johnson here, Councilmember Claudia Balducci across the street, have been working on this.2019 will be a year, I believe, where we're going to make some big progress. So to Mayor Durkan and her departments, I really want to acknowledge that we took their budget and built on that and spent it just extending my thanks to all the departments that continue to work with us and once again acknowledging the good workthat our council central staff had. The clerks. Thank you to Amelia, Jody, Linda, for your constancy and your help. And you're creating scripts that would help me get through substituting motions once again. And then I just have some very direct, personal thanks to my colleagues up here and just starting from my left at the end, Councilmember wasalways the advocate for D5. Thank you for the good work that you did in bringing money forward for the food banks and the additional shelter Mother Nation, God's Little Acre Aurora Commons. They'd never seen the kind of help that you brought to them this year.So thank you for that. The Lake City Community Center, I know, is thrilled that that is going to be a place that will be really extended and expanded. So thank you for that. Councilmember Mosquito, since I'm just going to state coming down the row here, your 2% increase across the board for our human services providers.Thank you for taking the lead on that. It was wonderful today to be with you as you were bringing some workers forward and just tell me what a difference that's going to make in their lives, small but mighty and symbolic.And I also want to thank you for working with me on the idea of getting a child care center here in city hall. And. One thing I just have to say. Councilmember Mosquito, I appreciate you about you so much is just the amazing good cheer you bring every day to this dias.I'm very thankful to be a colleague working on these things with you and just the ways you seek compromises. It means a great deal to me. So thank you so much for that. Councilmember Sawant, I want to thank you for working on the basic shelter, the 217 bed, something that you and I agreed on from the verybeginning. I appreciated your advocacy for the eviction attorney and of course getting some stable money for the Indigenous Peoples Day. So thank you for that. Councilmember O'Brien, it's always a pleasure. Thank you for working on the green jobs, for expanding lead, for expanding the evergreen treatment hours that we know so important.The work that you did on the Equitable Development Initiative and frankly recognizing the importance of our Office of Sustainability and Environment Climate Director. So, you know, you led those charges, and I thank you for that. Council President Harrell sitting right next to you.Thank you for helping me through all this. But for your investments in historic Seattle and Northwest African American Museum. Of course, you did a lot around our community outreach, but also the money that you were able to add at the last minute around the central area community PDA so that we can get more more affordable housing inthat area and apprenticeship programs. Councilmember Gonzales, it's just been a real pleasure working with you. Thank you for your help. Helping me through as my vice chair on this. I think it was a very effective process having you there, helping and focusing and reminding us about the needs of many communities that you're very close to.So I appreciate that. And you know what? You did what you did with helping us get defense services for sexual assault survivors and immigrant and refugees, the LGBTQ senior community services, it's all going to make a difference. Councilmember Johnson, you've done a lot for your district around Magnuson athletic fields, getting those advance in the Sippy and theMagnuson Community Center. Ours open more investments in our community health engagement locations, as well as increasing dollars for food delivery services and some very important small but very important visual things such as your suicide prevention signs on the bridges.That was something that hadn't been brought up before. Thank you for that. And Councilmember Herbold, already one advocate. I'm very grateful to you for all of the things that you brought forward, whether it was a South Park public safety coordinator or increasing the pool hours in your community and getting additional funds for your school.But you've done a lot around making sure that 35th is paved. And you really brought home many of the things that I know the people in your community have needed. So I just want to recognize you and recognize you all for being super colleagues.And I know that there's been some stressful moments, but I appreciate the fact that everybody's worked together to reach that compromise. And again, thanks to all of you in the community who've been willing to come forward, provide your comments, your thoughts.Jonathan, thank you for wearing the walk with not by sweatshirt. I appreciate what you're doing as well. So to all of you, to those of you that are representing share, that are living in our community. You are always welcome here.And I appreciate so much the words that you brought to us. It helps us.Thank you. Chair Becky Shaw and Councilmember Bagshaw. Councilmember Johnson.I just want to say a big thank you to you, Councilman Bagshaw, for helping to get this across the finish line. You stole most of my speech with a little couple of three things that you had on that I'm proud to fight for.But, you know, in addition, there are many advocates who spend a lot of time and energy in city hall over the last several months as we debate and advocate for individual priorities within our purview is and one of those is still hanging out here.And I want to say thank you to her. So for the folks from the Public Defender's Association who fought so hard for the work around community health engagement locations, the additional $100,000 that we put into the budget this year brings our city investment to $1.4 million.When you couple that with the money from the mid coming from the county, we expect that number to be about $3 million. That should be plenty for us to make sure that we site an open a safe consumption site this year, which I think is critical for our city to continue to make sure that we focus onpeople who are alive, staying alive and thinking of our people as people. Because I don't believe that any human being is a lost cause.Thank you.Okay. We have a bill that's been amended. Councilmember Skeeter, you have the floor.Thank you, Mr. President. First, I want to start by thanking the budget chair, Councilmember Bagshaw. You have welcomed me into this budget making process and made me feel very welcome. Thank you for working with my team and my office throughout this process to make sure that our proposals could jointly be more successful.I also want to thank your staff member, Alison, as well. She has worked with us to make sure that this budget stayed on track and helped to juggle nine of our different priorities up here. So I really appreciate her work along with our central staff.Thank you so much for all your work throughout the last few months here. I do want to thank my staff. This was our first time at going through the budget process. So a huge thank you for SAGE, for her leadership in helping all of us get through this process.Thank you to Michael and Ruthanne Friday for all your incredible work as well. And we know that today we have made some significant down payments on some really pressing issues in our city. It goes without saying that we have a huge task in front of us.And today we make some inroads into trying address trying to address monumental tasks like taking on homelessness, creating more affordable housing, dealing with mobility needs for transportation throughout our cities. And we're doing this with no new revenue. So what we've been able to do in front of us really is an effort to try to address some ofthe most critical elements that we see in our city. And what you've heard from us is a commitment to come back and find additional revenues so that we can address these pressing issues with urgency and integrity. And I think that we all understand the significant revenue restraints that are upon us, whether it's through the types of revenueor the limitations on how we can spend that revenue. There's compounding issues also at play at the state level, multiple imon initiatives. The fact that the state is the only well, it's one of the most prosperous states without an income tax, without a capital gains tax, without a corporate income tax.We have a lot of issues in this whole state and as a region that we can continue to address to make sure that we're really getting at the heart of the regressive nature of our tax structure. In addition to that, though, as we talk about needing additional dollars for housing, you've continued to hear us call for usto more equitably invest in developing housing throughout the city and outside of the budget. I know myself and Councilmember Johnson and a number of other council members are committed to addressing the fact that 86% of our residential land is still zoned for single family use.When we have such a huge housing crisis, the need for apartments, first time home ownership options, the need to live near transit facilities and child care and jobs. We have to address the zoning limitations as well, and that is something that we will continue to address.And as we do, we also, I hope what you've heard from us in this budget is we're lifting up the words of renters. As a renter, we all know it's important for us to remember that over half of the residents in Seattle are renters.And as we create more house options that are affordable, we also have invested in this budget in tenant protections and tenant rights, which I'm really proud of. So I think I think my colleagues and the community for making sure that we were able to get some of these investments in there.And I will I am committed to continuing to work with you all to make sure that we have the funding that we need for housing, addressing the homelessness crisis, investing in health, and making sure that our communities are kept whole.Part of this work, I think, is going to be done in our efforts to look at the reset of Move Seattle so we can address the need for more transit options. Part of this work is going to be done through the Select Committee on Homelessness and Housing Affordability, which I'm happy to co-chair with my colleagues to makesure that we're not just looking again at what the route is, but trying to figure out how we can invest in the solution. And in order to do so, we need revenue. We also know that our interest in scaling up some of these easements is going to require us continuing to lift up our voices again.And much of what you have done in this budget is because you came to testify, you shared your stories. You were here every day over the last three months, let alone the last year that I've been here. It's almost been a year.And here's what we I am excited to lift up. In addition to what Chair Boxer mentioned, I just want to highlight a few pieces that I'm really proud about and want to thank you for your leadership in this child care facility, in this building, making sure that we're eliminating funding for jail beds that are not being usedand continuing to scale down the number of people that are going into incarceration. We're funding a study for looking at air and noise pollution and Beacon Hill, and we're making sure that our zip code does not contribute to our life expectancy and our health outcomes.We're funding a home zone pilot project to calm down traffic. We're investing in the Thomas Street Greenway. We're stopping our efforts while we're trying to curb our efforts to contract out so many positions, we are looking at how we can get rid of the tax on tampons.We are trying to create a more equitable tax structure, even though it's one of many issues that we need to take on. We're also addressing the need for us to have a more public health response in our communities.And we're scaling up our communicable disease response with our partners in public health. We're investing in creating an accurate census so that every resident in Seattle can get counted and make sure that every federal dollar follows that resident and that we're not leaving any of our community members behind.We've created a racial equity toolkit so we can analyze our Seattle growth strategy and do proactive work before the next comprehensive plan. And as you heard today, we're investing in the frontline workers, the mental health providers, chemical dependency counselors, those who are helping individuals with case management to keep jobs, find jobs, stay in the schools so thatthey don't go back out into the streets so that we can create true housing stability and hopefully one day build the housing so that we can help move people in. I know that this was not everything that we all wanted because we don't have the sufficient revenue need that we need.But I know that working together, we can continue to make sure that we are addressing these pressing challenges in our city. The pressing challenges that we have are not unique to Seattle, but I think that in the next six months to a year, we will come back to you with additional options for helping to invest in ourfamilies, our seniors, our children and our local small businesses. And with that, I thank you, Council President and Madam Chair, for all the work that you put into this year's budget.Thank you, councilmember skater. Councilmember Suarez.Q I wasn't going to say anything, but I will be very brief. This is my third budget. Here in Olympia, I sat through five budgets, and it was it's definitely a different process in the state of Washington. First of all, I just want to really and I really do mean this I really want to thank council member, our chairperson Sally Bagshaw, for doing a great process and taking the time to listen.And.Talk and agree and disagree and be okay when we don't agree.I appreciate that.I want to thank Alison.Alison, you were amazing.Thank you again for taking the time to come in our office and talk to us and work through difficult issues. And of course, a big thank you to director Kirsten Armstead and central staff and all of the people who help us and do the charts, work late at night, work on weekends, call us on Saturdays and Sundays. I don't think people.See what goes on behind the scenes, but I really.Want to thank them. And most of all, I really, truly want to thank my colleagues, all the people up here. We all work together. We work hard. We don't always agree.We don't always get what we want.I think there's a song about that.But we try to work together.With the limited resources that we.Have. I think every year I'm always I'm always awestruck and always still thinking about how we can make our city better. And for 2019, I look forward to a regional response to our most critical issues, and that is.Sheltering the unsheltered food.Scarcity, addressing the opioid addiction, and also addressing missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. I think one thing that I've always known in living in the city is that Seattle.Is a big city with big city.Problems, and sometimes I think we don't see.It that way that we aren't this small little town, provincial town anymore. We actually have big city problems which require us to reach.Out and across the aisle and certainly to have a regional response to the issues that are affecting.All of us. As my Uncle Billy used to say, if a stream is polluted or a watershed.Is polluted, it isn't Pierce County that just get sick, or King County or Thurston County. We all get sick. So it's all.Of our jobs to keep the environment clean, to have jobs.To look at health, to have a safety net for those that don't have what.Some of us are so lucky to have. And so with that.Again, I want to thank my colleagues for.All of us working together. And with that. Again, thank you, Councilmember. Our chairperson Bagshaw.Thank you. Councilman. Worse. Okay. Thanks for those words. Colleagues and I think we are ready to vote. So having said that, please call the roll on the passage of council bill 119392 as amended.Gonzalez I. Herbold I. Johnson Whereas mascara i. O'Brien Sergeant No. Bagshaw High President Harrell High eight in favor one opposed.The bill passes and the chair will sign it. And let's go with the resolution. Please read 35 into the record.\nSummary:", "answer": "AN ORDINANCE adopting a budget, including a capital improvement program and position modifications, for The City of Seattle for 2019; and creating positions exempt from civil service; all by a 2/3 vote of the City Council."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nMadam Secretary, please positively announce the results tonight. Tonight, 1937, as amended, has passed. All right. That's not the tempo for the next two. All right. Next, we have two bills, 69. Councilman Brooks, would you please put accountable 69 on the floor for final passage yet?Yes, Mr. President, I place Council Bill 69 to be placed on the floor for final consideration and do pass.Moved and seconded. Public hearing for Councilor Bill 69 is now open. May we have the staff report?Tourism research with community planning and development. How I ended up in the wrong place. So this is a rezoning located at 5050 South Syracuse Street. The request is to rezone from B eight with waivers and use overlay one and use overlay to two suburban mixed use 12 stories.Eight is the former chapter 59 zone district waivers will get into, and the use overlays are for adult uses and for billboards. So this is located in Council District four in the Hampton South neighborhood, generally north of Bellevue Avenue, south of Union Avenue, east of Interstate 25, and west of Goldsmith Gulch.It is within a half mile of the Belleview Station Transit Station. The property is about an acre or 55,000 square feet. Currently a restaurant use and the waivers are for fabrication and wholesale and warehousing and reducing the four area ratio from 4 to 1 to 2 to 1.Property owner is requesting rezoning to get rid of that far limitation. So again, the request is to rezone from eight, which was a heavy business zoned district and very intense business zoned district with waivers. Use overlay one and use overlay two to suburban context.Mixed use 12 storey height. So the suburban context is characterized mostly by single unit and multi-unit and commercial strips and office parks. Single unit is generally suburban house forms. Multi-unit are primarily located on archer arterials and collectors, and the block pattern can vary from a modified grid to in some of the office parks like in this location, very different block shapes and sizes depending on the street on the street system. So again, the context surrounding context is B eight with waivers u0102 The land use is restaurant. It is a one storey building currently. So the waivers that we're talking about do apply to all of the surrounding properties as well.Waive the right to fabricate anything other than art goods, custom clothing, costumes, custom furniture, jewelry and needlework. Waive the right to sell at wholesale and warehouse, but reserve the right to sell at retail. Waive the right to the amount of gross floor floor area allowed in the Bay Zone District, which was that four times the size ofthe property or the zone lot, and instead have a two times the area of the zone lot requirement. And then the addition of the you will want and you ought to use overlays, allowing adult uses and billboards. And so all of these waivers are the same for the surrounding properties.Again, it is an existing restaurant adjacent to another restaurant to the south, and then surface parking and office buildings of varying heights. You'll see that in the pictures here. The restaurant itself is in the upper right hand corner.The surface parking lot to the east is the middle of the right. The restaurant across the private drive is lower. Right. A five story office building across Syracuse and the lower left. And then a 12 story office building to the northeast of the property, surrounded also by surface parking.So that there is no registered neighborhood organization in the area other than I.N.S. and the Denver Neighborhood Association. So those are the organizations the applicant reached out to. And all of the written notice and posting has been correctly done for both the planning board hearing, the plan committee hearing, and for this hearing and of course, written noticeof the receipt of the application. As soon as the application was thought to be complete on November 5th, we notified council and the registered neighborhood associations and to date we have no public comment on this application. So you know the criteria very well.Let's get into them. The plans that are relevant. Our current plan 2000 and Blueprint Denver Current plan tells us to enhance the existing business centers, particularly the DTC Denver Tech Center, which is our second largest employment center, to preserve and enhance the vitality of our business centers and to encourage quality infill development that's in character with thesurrounding area. Blueprint Denver Land use concept for the property is employment, where we typically see office warehouse, some light manufacturing and some high tech uses as described in Blueprint. And there are definitely fewer residences with some commercial and industrial uses and the property is in an area of stability.Future street classification for Syracuse Street is mixed use arterial, where we want to see a high degree of mobility and these types of arterials generally interconnect major urban centers like downtown, major shopping centers, major office centers and Syracuse Circle itself is a private street, so we would consider that a local street.Staff believes that the criteria for consistency with adopted plans is met and that we, by getting out of the customs zone district of waivers, that we are furthering the uniformity of district regulations. And by implementing our plans, we are furthering the public health, safety and welfare.The justifying circumstances has changed conditions. The applicant cites the obsolescence of this, of the waivers on the property changing in the property from the restaurant to the office use and the new zone district, allowing care for the property to redevelop in character with the surrounding area.Staff believes this is the appropriate and justifying circumstance. So as far as consistency with the zone, district purpose and intent, we talked a little bit about the suburban and context, the single unit, multi unit in strip centers and office parks, the multi-unit and commercial uses primarily on arterials and collectors and the varying block shapes and sizes dependingon the whether it's a modified grid or not, even a grid street system. And then the mixed use zone district does promote safe, active, diverse uses and is appropriate on major arterials, which is, of course, or South Syracuse.So with that staff recommends approval of this rezoning, believes all the criteria are met.Thank you, Miss Cicero. We have one speaker tonight, Michael Campa.Good evening, Mr. President. Members of the Council. My name is Michael Campa and I'm representative of the applicant. And I am here and thank you. In the interest of time, I will remain available to answer any questions. Thank you.That concludes our speakers. So questions from members of the Council, Councilwoman Ortega.I have one question in all of the drawings that were in the PowerPoint. It shows the boundaries actually encroaching into Syracuse Street. Is that intentional or help me? Yeah, I guess if you could address. When we rezone property, we do rezone the street to the center line of the street.Okay. Okay. I hadn't always noticed that in many of the other applications that have been brought forward. No, that's the way we do it. So that there is no in-between. There's always the zone district right up next to another zone district.All right. Thank you.Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. Councilwoman Black.Thank you, Mr. President. I have a couple of questions for Mr. Champa. This building is in the Denver Tech Center, and this council is often asking questions about development plans, and you actually have development plans. So I think it would be interesting to hear from you about the architectural controls that are enforced by the Denver Tech Centerand also to talk a little bit about your parking situation.Okay. As you are probably aware, the Denver Tech Center has a very strict set of architectural controls. We've been through two of four meetings with them already. The building will be essentially a glass curtain wall facility. And rather than going to the sea of parking sort of approach that some of the buildings out there have, all theparking will be contained in a structure within the building envelope. So there will be virtually no surface parking on the site. As to the traffic movement, we had a number of discussions with the tech center as to how best to orchestrate the traffic on the site.And the parking in particular is three and a half spaces per thousand, which is one space per 200 and some square feet.Okay. Thank you. And another thing I found interesting about this project is you're fairly close to the Bellevue Light Rail station. And can you tell everyone here about your thoughts on getting people to and from that light rail station?We are the property is about a ten minute walk from the Bellevue Light rail station, which is easily walkable. We also have a bus stop at the property. We are looking at a bike station there and we are also talking with the tech center about the shuttle to transfer some of the building occupants to the light railstation.Thank you.Thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman Black. Any other questions on 69? CNN public hearing is now closed. Time for comments, Councilwoman Black.Thank you, Mr. President. This is in my district. It's currently a restaurant called Garcia's of Scottsdale, which has been there since I was in high school. So I'm sad to see it go, although I haven't been there since the eighties.Anyway, the Denver Tech Center is an office park. It's a very thoughtful development. The developer and I have met several times. I've been out to see the property and I think it's very thoughtfully done. One thing we didn't bring up is the fact that it's going to be LEED certified as well, which I think is another greataspect of the building. So I think it's very appropriate and I will be supporting it this evening. Thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman Black. Any other comments on 69? Scene on Madam Secretary, Roll Call.Black Eye. Brooks Espinosa. Hi, Flynn.Hi.Gilmore Cashman. Hi. New Ortega says Hi, Mr. President. Hi.Madam Secretary, please quote a very nasty result tonight. Tonight, 69 has been placed on final consideration and does pass. All right. We've got one more. That is Councilor Bill 87. And Councilman Brooks, would you please put 87 on the floor for final passage?\nSummary:", "answer": "Rezones property located at 5050 South Syracuse Street from B-8 with waivers, UO-1, UO-2 to S-MX-12 in Council District 4.

Now we're going to move back to item 28. That would be. She please.Item to item item 28 Communication for Mayor Garcia Recommendation to receive and file a report from the City Manager on earthquake preparedness in Long Beach.Right to have a report on that week.Mr. Vice Mayor, members of the city council. This was an item that the mayor has put on to really educate the community about what the city does in during an earthquake. So we obviously had those two right on the fourth and the 5th of July.Rest assured. Ah, we were responding. We were. Everything was working the way that it should. And we'd like to really take this chance to hear from Reggie Harrison on behalf of our departments about what it is that we do during an earthquake, what we recommend to the public on how they can help.And also talk a little bit about seismic resiliency hearing from development services. So with that, I will turn it over to Reggie Harrison, our director of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Communications.Thank you.Thank you. Thank you, Mayor, and members of City Council for this opportunity to present this update to you. Seismologists have for years been predicting a strong earthquake to impact this area. City staff has taken those predictions seriously at the beginning of the year, at the beginning of fiscal year in October.The city hosted a Homeland Security Executive seminar attended by our management team, all department heads, including the Port and Water Department. We were joined by 60 other participants, including including the L.A. and Orange County Sheriffs, the L.A. City Police and Fire, the FBI, National Guard and others.We brainstormed around a catastrophic event that would require all of our collective efforts, like an earthquake. We put it we put into practice the lessons learned from that seminar that day. To be clear, earthquakes cannot be predicted, not even by the famed Southern California seismologist, Dr. Lucy Jones.What we do know is that we live in an area prone to earthquakes, and we need to be prepared to survive as individuals, as a family and as a city. So on July 4th, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake rattled.Southern California was the largest earthquake that we had experienced in the last 20 years. The quake struck near the city of Ridgecrest and in Kern County, which is about 160 miles northeast of Los Angeles. People, however, felt the effects of that earthquake from Las Vegas to Phenix to Ensign out of Mexico.Then one day later, on July 5th, a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the exact same area. That the second earthquake was larger, higher in magnitude, and the first was alarming even to seismologists and of course, to many residents. There is no doubt had either one of those earthquakes hit closer to the metropolitan Los Angeles area, there would havebeen injuries. Compare this to the 1994 Northridge 6.9 magnitude earthquake, which killed 57 people and caused billions of dollars in damages. In Long Beach. We train our staff and work with our residents to be prepared for all hazards.Of course, we live on the Pacific Rim and with that comes the rest of us tsunami or sea level rise. We are responsibility for securing the twin ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. And with that comes terrorist threats and natural and man made disasters, as well as we're responsible for the Los Angeles and Long Beach airports. Again, terrorist attacks and natural disasters are major concerns there. Now, an earthquake is the most probable disaster that we face in this area because of the many earthquake fault lines that crisscross the region. Many fault lines are near Long Beach, including the Newport-Inglewood, Palos Verdes and Cabrillo Fault Lines.And you see some of those fault lines depicted there in that picture. The city has many disaster preparedness and response plans that comport with the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA's national standards. All of our plans have been approved by FEMA.The fact that we have plans that have been approved by FEMA allows us to be able to apply for additional grants as well as for disaster response reimbursement. Community outreach is one of our major priorities, and we take a whole community approach to disaster preparedness and train our staff and residents to be prepared for all hazards, whetherpreparing for an earthquake or tsunami. Having a family emergency plan is one of the most important things we can do. The plan should include where to meet if the family is separated, and a communications plan for contacting a relative who lives outside of the impacted area.And we also encourage residents to think about their pets as well. What are the needs of pets? We've we've seen across the country that people tend not to evacuate from their homes. And unless they're sheltered in us, their pets can also travel with them.We encourage residents to become members of certain, to be trained in areas to promote self-sufficiency. Residents should take disaster related first aid classes from the Red Cross and other providers. The really Long Beach, the the very Long Beach Disaster Preparedness and Resource Fair is one of the largest of its kind in California.Last year, we attracted over 3000 attendees for this event, the fire department said. And the Department of Disaster Preparedness. Our primary organizers for the event were representatives from across Southern California attend this event. The Red Cross. Los Angeles County Resources.The National Guard. SoCal, Edison and other utilities are there. We have events that include first aid demonstrations, emergency vehicle displays and preparedness booth for various vendors. This is a much sought after event. Representatives from Cal Lewis often come down to this event to just experience how large of an event this is.This year's event will be held on September the 28th at Cal State University, Lombardi's campus. Earthquake preparedness, in particular before an earthquake. And I talked about some of these already before the shaking begins. We should have family plans, go kits in place, and especially for an earthquake, secure, breakable items and large items that tend to fall overand of course, take first aid classes during an earthquake. I think we all know the drill. We practice that the last couple of weeks I believe now since the earthquakes to drop, cover and hold on drop to the floor and cover your neck and head and hands and get under a table and just hold on until theshaking stops. Running out of a building is not recommended. It's not a good idea as objects attached to buildings tend to fall off. In fact, the only people that got killed in the Paso Robles earthquake back in 1992 were people who ran out of the store and got hit by falling debris from the store after an earthquake. As a time to check for injuries to your family and neighbors, turn off gas only if you smell leaking gas and listen for updates from the city and be prepared for aftershocks. One of the programs that we are really promoting with neighborhoods and a number of you council members have seen me make presentations on this program, whichis really your Long Beach neighborhood. Recent events across the country have shown that the new first responders in the immediate aftermath of a disaster are fellow neighbors. Neighbors helping neighbors is the basis of the map. Your Long Beach neighborhood program that we are encouraging residents to participate.And through this program, we teach residents to understand and identify the risks in their neighborhood. Who are the elderly, the mobility impaired, the residents that are dependent on electrical medical equipment, and then to also identify the resources that they have in their community, who other residents that have plumbing skills, electrical skills, who's that neighbor that has everygadget in his or her garage that you can imagine? Who are the retired nurses and teachers? And so through this approach. Neighbors develop a plan for how they will help each other until a police and fire personnel arrive.They identify a meeting place who is going to check on the elderly, the children who are home alone, who will make rounds to determine if gas lines are busted. I place at each of your chair a backpack that we intend to be able to distribute a few to the neighborhoods that successfully go through this program, where thisdoes take work on the part of our neighbors where we have staff that's available to assist with that. Alert. Long Beach is the city's emergency mass notification system. And you'll recall during the power outage in 2015, system did not service our community well.We have a new system in place that we implemented shortly after the 2015 power outage. This is a system by which we would notify our residents what has happened. What first responders are doing and what actions our residents should take to protect themselves.Residents do have to sign up for alert based to be able to receive voice, text or email messages. During the Ridgecrest earthquake, we sent out three messages through this system and one of them for the first time ever, we sent a message to the entire database in the city of Long Beach, 197,000 phone numbers.We had a 45% rate reach and we gained 6000 new contacts either text voice or email contacts to the system. We have made signing up even easier for residents. You can easily sign up for alert lobbies by simply texting alert L.B. to 99411 and a sign up link will be sent to you.It's as simple as that to be able to receive these emergency notifications. Shakealert. L.A. is a relatively new app that has just come out. It was in effect prior to the Ridgecrest earthquake. Our residents need to download this app to be able to provide a warning of a pending earthquake.Lambie's beta tested the technology behind this app for the previous four years. We have confidence in it that it works. The public facing app test that has been released is set at a 5.0 and above earthquake. Hence, we did not receive an earthquake warning through the system for the Earth for the Ridgecrest earthquake.However, the city of Los Angeles has reset that threshold now, so it's a much lower threshold so that the notice would be sent out. The system provides information and English and Spanish is available on for iPhones or Android.You have to download that app and the city and the county and the city of Long Beach. Disaster preparedness will continue to work to perfect this notification system. We recently completed the development of a crisis communication plan, working with a consultant and a city manager's peer and peers from across the city.This plan provides guidance for the coordination of communications during during a crisis. The plan considers all communication platforms, including social media, media and press releases. The plan is also sensitive to the needs of our non-English speaking residents and those with other disabled access and functional needs.This slide provides an outline for how incident manager incident response flow works from the street level up to the federal government. The slide also depicts the scalability of this federal system. Every incident, regardless of the size, utilizes the incident management system.Every department has staff that has been trained in the system. Police and fire have personnel that have received advanced training and all has an incident management system. Often are all hands. Teams are requested to go out to assist other jurisdictions outside of the city of Palm Beach.Our fire department plays a critical role in in the event of an earthquake. A priority for them is to ensure the safety of their equipment or apparatus that it is not so that they're not stuck in firehouses. They're responsible for making critical facilities checks.And as you can see from the previous slides, fires do erupt during an earthquake. And so they all have a primary role of controlling those fires. Similarly, the police department, the police are our eyes and ears out on the street.They provide us with situational awareness in terms of what's going on across the city. The police would coordinate evacuations if necessary. Police would also enforce any curfews that may be established by the city council and much, much more responsibilities.Public Works has a responsibility to ensure the free flow of traffic by removing debris that might hamper first responder police, fire, emergency medical personnel. They also have a responsibility to check critical facilities. I hope the Human Resources Department is responsible for coordinating mass care and sheltering sites if necessary.The city health officer would issue orders regarding air quality or boil water any of those issues related to health. Our city health officer would have that responsibility. And with that, I'm going to turn this presentation over to Linda Tatum.Thank you, Reggie. I will be covering some of the proactive activities and a little bit of the history regarding the city's efforts regarding seismic activity. And the first is a just a piece of trivia in history regarding the 1933 Long Beach earthquake.It was that earthquake that where there were over 100 deaths caused and and more than $40 million in damage. And interestingly enough, the the deaths were caused by people leaving the buildings and being hit by falling debris. But as a result of that earthquake, the good that came out of it were two really critical pieces of seismiclegislation. The first was the Field Act. And what that did was establish or was the basis for the city's office creation of the state's Office of State Architecture. And that's the entity at the state level that actually permits and approves all of the state facilities, as well as critical care facilities, things like hospitals and schools, again, publicschools and hospitals. The second provision in the legislation was the Riley Act, and that was the legislation that required all cities and counties to regulate building construction. So it was a very early days of the California building code.So the very first and most vulnerable buildings that occur during that are that are damaged during seismic activity are what we call the unreinforced masonry building. So essentially buildings that are the brick buildings. And back in 1971, the city did an inventory of all of its masonry buildings, and it was a voluntary program for the property ownersto actually seismically reinforce those buildings. And it was amended in 1976 to make that a mandatory requirement for owners of those buildings to upgrade those buildings with retrofits. And from this program, the city did an inventory, and of the 936 buildings identified, the vast majority were actually repaired, but a significant number, over 300 were actually demolished.And the very last building that was completed under this program, which took a number of years, was the Masonic Temple that's located on Locust Avenue, one of the city's historic buildings in the downtown, and that was retrofitted as recently as 2007.So I talked a little bit about the soft story buildings. That's the I'm sorry, I talked about the unreinforced masonry. Another very vulnerable building that we have to deal with here in the city are what we call soft story buildings.And those are essentially buildings that where there is no attachment to the foundation. And this photograph here that shows the tuck under parking, that's essentially what the type of construction that we mean when we talk about soft story building.As you recall, during the the 1994 Northridge earthquake, that's when the city first implemented a voluntary program for other types of vulnerable building construction. And the slide here shows a list of those buildings. But of course, they include single family residential buildings that were not at the time they were constructed many years ago under the building codes. They were not required to be attached to the foundation. So that's one of the major categories. And then I talked about the soft story buildings. Again, this is an example of those were the the building the wall of the building is not attached to the building foundation.And there are a couple of other types of vulnerable construction types. And after the Northridge earthquake, that's when the city required these buildings to be seismically retrofitted. I'm sorry, a voluntary program for these buildings to be retrofitted. So what I'd like to talk about here is one of the city's efforts starting in the late 1990s, which wasan assessment district. It was the city's first attempt to try to establish a funding source for buildings that were damaged or buildings that were built under former building codes that were not seismically anticipated to withstand substantial earthquake activity.They created an assessment district and that covered about over 500 residential structures. And this was, again, some of the older, more vulnerable buildings built under older building codes, essentially pre 1934 buildings. And after the initial assessment, we added additional 65 units to this assessment district.So the results of the assessment district were mixed because of some of the extensive work that needed to be done to some of these buildings. There were definitely some some issues with the buildings. Some of the property owners were able to complete the seismic retrofits without any issues.But there were a number of problem areas where the scope of the retrofits were more substantial than the property owners could handle. That resulted in some some cases where a few property owners actually lost their properties. And this effort actually continued until I'm going to say about the mid-term, early to mid 2000s.But that program and that assessment district is is no longer active. So that's kind of a lesson learned for the city, because as we go forward, we'll be looking to make sure that any future program that the city structures will take into account the kind of the potential funding sources.And we'll be looking for ways to incentivize for property owners to be able to complete the the necessary retrofit. So this next slide just gives you a list of some of the buildings throughout the state of California that have actually undertaken a number of different approaches in terms of how they've addressed having their building inventory, in termsof a number of different approaches and how they funded, whether they provide incentives. So there is a lot of good information in some of the cities that have started programs. And as we go to the next step and try to and start to craft our program, we'll be looking carefully at each of these programs and making surethat we establish best practices from among the cities that do have active programs. And I think as anything, we'll just need to be aware that there is no magic bullet. There is no one city that has a perfect program.I think, like most of our other efforts, will need to look carefully at the city of Long Beach. We're different from many other cities in the state. We have an older building stock and our income levels aren't necessarily what some of the other cities that have more aggressive programs.So we'll be looking at all of those factors. So again, the next steps for us, once we get direction from council, we will be looking at picking up a program, an effort we started initially back in 2018, which is a scope of work that brings on board a consultant to take a look at the inventory of thesebuildings so that we have a comprehensive inventory of the vulnerable buildings. We would then look to expand that scope of work to include having someone take a look at possible funding options again so that we can provide an incentive to property owners to support their retrofit activity.And we've had a very last year's effort. There was a preliminary price tag to do this work at 1.1 million. But again, we'll be going back to relook at that scope, seeing if there are some ways to make sure we get a very complete list of that scope of work with the added benefit of having them lookat funding sources and hopefully try to get a better value on that. But we'll be doing that through an RFP process. So we'll be again looking at that and looking at other cities programs to make sure that we establish a program that that works very specifically for the city of Long Beach.And again, just to close out here to talk about some statewide legislation that was previously considered, this was the AB 2681 that was proposed to require local and state reporting of the inventory program for for building. And that's the type of program we're going to be taking a look at.That bill was vetoed by the governor. So it's not a requirement. But again, we think it's best practice isn't something that the city should be moving forward on. And again, there are other proposed legislation regarding seismic resiliency. And we, through our city manager's office, will be continuing to track those bills.I'll turn it over now to Craig back to complete the presentation.Thank you, Linda. I think we have seen that the outline this evening is really focused on all the opportunities that exist relative to preparing and preparing one's residents to be safe. But we just wanted to spend a brief moment highlighting some of the critical infrastructure that we have in Long Beach and what we're doing to make surethat it's safe for continued use. So we know right now that there is over 200 facilities in the city that we would consider a critical facility. So these are our fire stations, our police headquarters, our pump stations, our water and energy resource utilities.Certainly our city hall and other important government buildings. And then we we know we've identified some weaknesses, in particular some of our bridges. It's surprising to think, but we have over over 100 bridges in this in Long Beach, 131 that are owned by the city.So we need to start being diligent in analyzing those bridges and making sure that they're safe so we can provide access if we were to have a major event in the city. We want to make sure public safety can can get to those.But recently, as detailed, there's new building methods that really focus on the resiliency of a city facility. And I think the first city facility that really employed a lot of this was our echo. So there was actual rockers put within the building foundation.So it can kind of move independent from any motion that might happen in that was typical in an earthquake. Certainly our public safety building retrofit addressed many of those things, shoring up that structure and making it much more earthquake resilient.Our new passenger concourse at the airport is another example of where we strengthen the facilities and really build them from a place where we're understanding what earthquake motion does to a building and what improvements you can do in a building to help.You can never prevent 100%, but you make it much more resilient and much more likely to survive a major event. I really wanted to spend just a moment highlighting our City Hall and our main library. I know this council in the council before this this seated council really weighed heavy on this question about how safe is thecurrent city hall. And we know we have some seismic challenges in this building. And so when we took on the the project to build a new civic center and in particular a new city hall, seismic resiliency was one of the key issues that we looked at and that we really put within the entire RFP process.And when we we selected and finalized the layout of the building, it's really a matte foundation designed. So both the Port Tower and the City Hall Tower function together. And as far as resiliency, it was imperative that we are able to re-occupy the building in no more than five days of a major event, and that we wouldbe operational to the public. No, no more than 30 days from a major event. So that is built in and built into our contract with plenary. The project company in charge of the facility. And if for some reason they aren't able to meet those standards and they need to provide alternate space for us to look at them. So we take this all very seriously as we design any new project, any new facility, earthquake strengthening and resiliency is important to the project components. And just wanted to convey to not only the council but the community listening this evening that we are making our new facility stronger and any retrofit of an existing facility is done withearthquakes in mind. I'll pass it back over to you.So I've got the, the last line for presentation as a summary slide. The recent earthquakes really did crack our California cool over the 4th of July weekend. They motivated a lot of residents to get prepared. We saw an uptick in the number of residents who signed up for alert Long Beach.We saw an uptick in the number of residents visiting our website, looking for information. And then just anecdotal, just being out at department stores, hardware stores and others. You saw residents there getting fire extinguishers, water, gloves. It's never too late to get prepared.City department plans continue to evolve. The newly developed crisis communication plan allows us to quickly and effectively get messages out to our residents. Our first responders work as part of a regional response network to ensure we have resources necessary to manage an incident.And we take a ground up approach to disaster preparedness, starting with individual and family preparedness and working our way up through our neighborhoods and the city. We have to accept that we live in an area that is prone to earthquakes and we have to do our part to be prepared for it.Being prepared mentally and physically for whatever may come is what it's all about. We need to be ready to help ourselves and then each other. That concludes staff report. Various representatives from various departments are available to answer questions.Thank you very much. I want to thank the entire team. I think that was a very extensive and good report and a great update on our emergency disaster preparedness response, particularly to Mr. Harrison and your team. And also, of course, the entire public safety network that we have through public works and planning.And so are really, really important for us to always get updates on this. Just a few, a few comments. So I had asked Mr. West to kind of bring this back and to prepare a presentation, because I think it's important to put it out there and continue to put that information out there.We had a pretty, I think, you know, serious scare recently with with the quakes. And I think that it certainly got people's attention. It's certainly got my attention. And I was reminded as I had conversations with the chief and Mr. West and others in the minutes following both of the quakes, that that this information is really importantto review and to practice and to continue to review and to keep going through our our our our our preparedness consistently. A few things I want to note. I do. We made an effort the next day to increase our alert Long Beach sign ups and we doubled them or doubled more than doubled them, which I think isreally important. I want to encourage residents to please sign up for alert Long Beach, and I want to encourage staff to continue at every possible event to continue to to do that. I want to ask Mr. West also, we need to make a personal appeal to our city employees there, 6500 of them.They should all be on alert. Long Beach. And the fact that we have how many folks signed up already to have 10,000 folks signed up, maybe on alert. Long Beach, is that right, Mr. Harrison? On the cell phone.Of course, we can we can call, I think, over 150 or 160,000 or whatever the number is. But we need to I would expect that that all of our city employees would be interested in being on that system.And so there needs to be an internal effort to do that. And so I would hope we would do that. I'll also just add, I think that our our cert operation teams and the fact that ready Long Beach and those groups are out so consistently in the community I think is really great to see.I see them in all the events in the community functions, so I think that obviously should continue. It. We continue to promote those that work. I wanted to just note. I'm not sure. Maybe, Mr. Modica, you could you can answer this.You and I talked about this some. So our our resiliency program, I just want to make sure that I know that that that issue has been before the council, before we discussed it. We want to I want to make sure that the timeline I know we still have it may be possible to your timeline to complete thatwork. And I really would like to see that moved up if possible. I know it's a lot of work. I know it's not easy, but I think that that that's just a little bit longer than that I think most of us would like.And so maybe you can get back to us on an expedited timeline and what that would look like. But I think we need to cut that, you know, cut that in half, hopefully, and and get something in front of this body as to what the next phase of this is.In addition to that, I will say that I want to commend the city, because we the first thing that we have done is kind of taking care of our own buildings and facilities. And so the fact that in two weeks we are moving out, we're moving out all of the employees in this building, which is a structurallyunsound facility into a facility that is to the latest standards on earthquake preparedness, I think is really important. And I'm glad that we're making repairs across the city on so many public buildings to to continue that work. But I do I do think that whether it's, you know, the Los Angeles program or or the Santa monica program, there are other programs that are out there. And I just want to I want to make sure that we adopt a program. I think it's that's that is important. And I know that funding is always a concern on the on the private side for for for property owners.And we certainly don't ever want to overburden property owners. We also don't want to. We also want to make sure we do everything we can to to ensure safety and the continuation of of of every person and life.And so don't want to repeat the disasters that we've had in the past as well. And so the last thing I'll say is I have been so impressed with our emergency response when we've had these incidents that have not in most cases been major.But what what happens in the way the PD and the fire department and public works and everyone kind of rolls out these plans is really impressive. Has been impressive for me to see as mayor and and to follow.And so I just want to commend the team. And and I think we just got to redouble our efforts and really focus on this. I know that, you know, interest in this sometimes wanes from from from from time to time because there may not be the emergency in front of us, but we just got to be vigilantconstantly on this issue. And so I want to thank the staff. I'm sure Mr. Murdoch could want to add anything to that, but I think you guys are pretty on top of it.And there's a good comments and we agree on the study. So, yes, it does take some time to do an inventory of everything as we go back out and relook at the scope of work would be happy to look at what we can do in different chunks and we also want to really focus on that.How do we get those economic solutions? Because that's something that we heard last time that we didn't quite have worked out.And maybe and maybe maybe it's done in those chunks. Right. And so we can get to some of the, the, the the lower hanging fruit and quicker.We'd be happy to look at phasing that so that we can do something a little bit different.Thank you, Councilmember Erika.Thank you, Mary. And I certainly have to agree with the last point you made in regards to the response of police and fire and this last event that we had, the updates that were given to us in regards to their checkpoints and to going to public facilities, ensuring that they were secure and no damage had been causedby the quake that that happened at Ridgecrest. One of the most important things about this report here, and I really want to commend staff for putting this together. It's very thorough. It covered practically all points that you would want to hear, including that as you were going through the report.I think we should probably get a little historical perspective on Long Beach and where we were back in 1933 to the present. And you did that. And I think that was important because it's always is that, you know, would you learn from from from your moment in history?One of the points that I see here also, although we may be encouraging, of course, our residents to send up to emergency to the emergency alert system. I think it's important that we have this kind of report yearly, maybe even twice a year, because of the you never know what a disaster is going to hit.And just being at the forefront of our minds is always important. So, I mean, I hope that we can maybe not as extensively, maybe once every two years, but I think every year we should have some kind of preparedness report such as this.I know we do it at our events that we're going to be having that the Cal State, Long Beach. But, you know, not everyone attends that and not everybody is is aware of what we might have available for them.So I think that having this kind of report to seek answers is important. But more importantly than that, I think we need to engage our media in regards to getting them to also post some of these recommendations for public safety.Also getting the alert system published through a PSA or event or through other kinds of media that we could use for them to alert the residents that there is this system available for them where they can get this kind of information.And, of course, the the extended resources that we have with Facebook and everything else that we use. I think as we move into our into the technical era that we are in using all these different mediums and platforms to expand the information, to make people more aware of the issues that are out there in terms of publicsafety and disasters, both natural and manmade, that we keep them aware and abreast of what's going on in our in our system. So, again, I want to just commend staff for a very thorough report. And I know when you look at police affairs, they're always conducting exercises and sometimes they seem redundant and they seem like boring.But that's how we get to do the bit. That's how we get to be the best we are. It's practice and it's practice all the time. And while it may be look routine, you never know when that practice is going to become a reality.So thank again. Yes.Thank you very much, Councilmember Pierce.I yes, I want to thank you, Mayor, for agenda raising this so quickly. It was definitely something that we had talked about a ton in my district. Doctor, disaster preparedness has been a key issue for the second district.We have the coastline, we have our downtown. We have many senior homes, high rise buildings in our district. So I want to thank you guys for this. We're constantly having this conversation. And right after the quake, we had our third roundtable of senior residents that were meeting about how we can improve their lives.And one of the biggest issues that they all hooked on to was the fact that most of them lived in a high rise building and none of them had been through a drill in their building. And so I know I quickly grabbed your ear a minute ago, but could you walk through for us, are there requirements forresidential, high rise buildings to have any kind of drills?No. There are currently no city regulations nor state regulations that we're aware of that would make that a requirement on building owners.So that is something that, you know, I know it's not in your report. I think it's your report. Fantastic. I really echo the comments about trying to get a quick timeline to have an assessment of those buildings. But in the meantime, we know that what they said with this last quake is it could be five years ofhaving, you know, the ripple effect from that. And so what are we doing to make sure that our residents, not only at our neighborhood meetings, because there's a population that's engaged and there's a population that works two and three jobs or they're elderly and they don't get out of their building.And so I have a real concern that, you know, say that the next big one is here, that we have a lot of people that maybe they went out and bought their kit, but they've never done it. I mean, how many people sat there during the quake and just looked at everybody and didn't get under a tableand didn't do the things that we know we're supposed to do? And so I, I will come back, and I hope that we can work together on trying to explore what options we have, particularly for our downtown, where we have senior high rise buildings and older buildings.And what we are doing to really whether it's annually, whether it's whenever new people move into a condo, what can we do as a city to really make sure that we're engaging with our constituents and that they're practicing their plan?Because I think if we really understood how many people have gone through a drill, know where the exits are, we would be pretty disappointed just because our lives are so busy from the from just a quick search at the Internet, looking at all the studies.Residential high rises are the least prepared. And so whatever we can do to make sure that we address that would be fantastic. I had another question on the right of your neighborhood, which, mind you, is all our downtown picture.So just making sure. What does it take for a community to get one of these presentations? How long does that take? How long does it take to set one up?I'm glad you ask that question, Councilmember. We have staff that has been trained and and are going through a training process to be able to conduct these meetings. The meetings actually take place in the neighborhood. Lead resident will invite their neighbors over to their house, living room, garage, lawn, wherever that might be.And the discussion would take place that I described in regards to identifying the resources and the rest and who's going to do.What.After a disaster. So the map here, Long Beach neighborhood is patterned off of a longstanding map, your neighborhood program that's been in existence for a while. We have the city of Long Beach has teamed up with the city of Los Angeles and the county of Los Angeles to roll this program out countywide so a neighborhood can bewhatever it is. So we can map your high rise. Right. We can map your apartment building. So certainly the people, residents in your district that we have a tool available for them. I would also just and with your prior questions, encourage residents to also participate in the Great California shakeout.And maybe that's something that we can promote more so that we can get to residents, so that they do practice that drill on a on an annual basis with which we can set up a competition among the districts and see how many people can sign up for it.You've done Facebook stuff with us in the past, and we're certainly willing to do those. And again.Yeah, that's great. Yeah, we've definitely we try to. My goal is to do a disaster preparedness video every quarter. But again, we get so busy that we let the disaster just kind of sit in the background. So I like those ideas.I would want to make sure that we have benchmarks that we're meeting. And so for me, I mean, my number one goal is as soon as you guys are ready that every one of my neighborhood associations and my business improvement district, I have 16 different groups that identify themselves that way in my district would get that doneas soon as possible. So my team is always here to help. But whatever we can also do to reach those buildings that are hard to get into, that have ways that don't. I mean, most of these senior buildings, we had a large conversation about it because they have a management company that's in there providing them those services. Even when we've had the city go in, they haven't allowed us to do presentations and things like that. So for some of those troubled buildings, we need to figure out how we make that a requirement, particularly, I think, for our senior building.That so many of those people in those communities are most vulnerable and might have disabilities or mental health challenges and are just our most vulnerable. So whatever we can do to to have that discussion in the future, I welcome that.So thank you, guys. Again, this was a thorough presentation. Look forward to keeping disaster preparedness as a priority.Thank you, Councilman Austin. Thank you, Councilmember Supernova.Thank you. This is going to be very specific, probably not the best venue for it, but I didn't think about it until this item came up tonight. But I it brought back my memories. So the night of the earthquake, I think the alert went out at 10:41 p.m. that police and fire personnel were going to be assessingdamage in the city. And I'm one just philosophically, I want more information, not less. That's my idea. But I question that when at I think it was. 12:36 a.m. an alert went out with the same intensity of any emergency that public safety officials have completed.The infrastructure checks, no reported damages have been received and in the city of Long Beach, unless new information becomes available. This will be the last update. So that's essentially an all clear update, but it comes in the wee hours of the morning with that same kind of intensity.So I don't know if I assume protocols are established about how these things go up, but that's that's some input I'd be willing to meet on a committee or whatever, like how will we want to lay this out?And for an all clear message, I'd be willing to wait till the morning. I think Mayor Garcia sent out a comforting message about 9:30 a.m. That was that was a good timing. Thank you.Make it, councilmember. Councilman Mongo.Thank you. I enjoyed the presentation. I appreciate the increase in uptick in the enrollment. I was at concert in the park at the time with approximately five other 5000 other residents, and I thought that it was a great opportunity to talk with neighbors about being prepared.I think one of the things that we often forget until we have a power outage or any of those things, is that you need to be able to provide food and water and save yourself for many days. And I think that your group is doing a great job, especially our CERT teams, in getting out and communicating thatto the community, in going into the details of the presentation and talking about bringing back some guidelines to help get the city infrastructure, the infrastructure within the city at a high level of preparedness in case of an emergency.I had read some things that I'm not clear on, but maybe you could help that. Many of the roofs in the region are all flat, so helicopters could land on them for rescues. But that in actuality, I'm internationally when these incidents occur, they don't actually use those helicopter pads for those things at all.And some cities, including Los Angeles, have actually changed the requirements and allowed for variances. And so. We might want to look at making those adjustments at this time if we have policies in place that are based on misinformation, I'll give an example.We don't stand in doorways anymore when there's an earthquake. That's not the protocol. And yet there are still people and teachers out there who haven't gotten the new updates to know that now you want to be underneath the desk or adjacent to a desk so that if something falls, you can be protected.So for that, I would also say that if there are any other earthquake guidelines in the city, that we could look at them and see if there are any that aren't fact based that we could erase them from from the.The ordinance or codes or whatever, so that the city can again, if safe, resume our economy and resume and increase our iconic skyline. Thank you.Thank you very much.Yes, thank you, Mayor. Mrs. Tatum, Mr. Beck and Mr. Harris, after the report in which I just heard, I think all of us can go home and sleep very. Safely tonight because that was a fantastic report and more information.I know A people hear that and they adhere to that. I know they will be able to get to any other quick that we have. Thank you, individuals, for giving us that fantastic report. Thank you again.Thank you. Just a quick note, just on behalf of the planning staff, I was talking to Councilman Mongo. I know that we a few years ago changed our our codes at the city and to align with some of what other downtowns are doing.These are relate to construction of roofs and giving the ability for for design that are not just, you know, flat helicopter pads. And so that's been changed. And that is why you are now seeing building designs with pointy roofs and spires and other things that are coming to the downtown.It was a big pet peeve. Councilwoman, go.That's great to hear. Maybe, perhaps we can also allow the places you already have, the flat roofs with helicopter pads defensively, put outdoor furniture and start utilizing that space more effectively. Because as I look out the windows of the new city hall next week or two weeks from now, and as I look at any other tall buildingin the city, there's a bunch of numbers on the tops of buildings with no furniture and no enjoyment. And I know there's a limited amount of downtown outdoor space. Let's start giving them the ability to use that space effectively.Thank you. Is there any public comment on the side of city seeing none or is that public comment? Please come forward.No. They had to do a lot of work up there.That's right. It could happen, but only after.Good evening. Tiffany Davie, resident of the fourth District. I want to thank you all for a very comprehensive report. I was looking forward to this. I actually started training with the California Specialized Training Institute the beginning of this year and with L.A. City EMT.So when we had this opportunity during this emergency to kind of see the language system in place, I received reports of 1041. I know. Was a little bit late, but the all clear going through felt like any time for that news was great.I look forward to the community partnership meeting that I believe was scheduled for the 18th and just in case, I didn't see that in the report, but it's now the 25th. Okay. And that's from 1 to 3 p.m..Okay. As well as perhaps more engagement for Stop the Bleed trainings. And there's also a mass. Mass casualty exercises in August. I learned of that at the Met Court kickoff of the year. So I just wanted to know if that could be updated on the website as well and just look forward to being able to find thecrisis communications plan as well as an updated hazard mitigation plan that reflects the new development that's taking place over the past five years. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Dave Shukla, Sun File, thank you very much for the presentation. So very informative. A couple of brief comments. First, an inventory of seismically vulnerable buildings in Long Beach is crucial, even if that doesn't move on state or county levels.It's important to know what here could potentially be affected. Bridge collapse. Also in disaster scenario planning is very instructive for traffic flow, but it's not the only impact. In my neighborhood, we're right by the Newport-Inglewood fault line and there's a lot of critical infrastructure that could severely limit ingress and egress out of the county.And it's important to kind of think through and these are exercises, you know, just look at a map. Cross some lines of what would we do? They're pretty easy to think through, but harder to actually implement in the way of practice.Councilwoman Pierce's point about requiring multifamily property owners to drill for seismic or other disasters is pretty intriguing. I would like to see a way that that that could actually be made amended, but not just for. For Senior living, but also for a lot of the high rises we have downtown and some of the workplaces as well thatare in some of these taller buildings. Lastly, a ground up approach or actually not. Lastly, sorry, one other point that a councilmember your group made was that we need to kind of wideband all the technologies that we get information out.One that we didn't hear that much about, especially older folks, still turn to handy dandy AM FM radio and being able to get information out across a variety of platforms is important. It's also important to recognize that. What your neighbors tell you is more likely than not going to be what sticks in your head.And so that brings me to the last point, which is the grownup approach is to be commended. And that's why it's absolutely crucial that we continue to support our program. Thank you.Thank you. Our last speaker.Hello. Good evening. My name is Johnny Wallace. I'm a resident of the seventh District and I am actually a graduate of the CERT program with Long Beach Cert. And although I was not here for the first earthquake and I got a lot of, you know, a lot of people asking me if I was I was actually studyingabroad when the first earthquake happened and I was talking with someone and they were like, oh, I'm glad you are here, because, you know, it could have been bad with that. And I was really like, I want it to be here, you know, to help if, you know, if I mean, luckily there wasn't any structural damage oranything like that that was too major. Um, but I would have liked to be here to help. Um, after I. Completed the CERT program. I actually went back to my neighborhood. It's actually right next to the Goldstar Manor.It's for veterans and a lot of elderly people live there as well as in my my neighborhood as well. But I actually went back to my neighborhood and did a presentation with the help of firemen from. You know that helped that help with the cert program by the name of JC Heflin.And they came by and gave them some first aid kits. But after the presentation, I, you know, gave my residents, the residents of my neighborhood survival kits. And that's all great. But I wanted to know, are there any plans on setting up neighborhood preparedness officers and are there any plans to establish new leadership roles within the communities, people that actually know the community outside of cert? Are there any opportunities to learn how to do better presentations and inform the community? Um, you know, all throughout Long Beach, I wanted to just know how to. You know, touch up on that because I was actually kind of in that California cool.You know, even though I wasn't here, I was still in that California cool because nothing had happened for some time. But as we know, you know, seismologists are predicting that artists are anticipating a greater threat from earthquakes in the coming years.So, you know, we're definitely trying to get ready, going to get ready for that. But, yeah, I want to keep my keep my neighborhood alert before a disaster like this. And. Yeah, thank you.First of all, thank you for doing it for us and for your interest. I think it's great to have folks that are out there volunteering and doing that work. So I just want to thank you also. I I'll make sure that we get get back to you in, Councilman.I think if you're not connected already, maybe someone from your team can go over there or someone from staff so that we can connect. These are some good ideas and some areas we're going to kind of close the loop on, I think, with certain fire and some other folks.And so maybe we'll do that. Councilman, we will connect with you in just in just a minute.Yeah. I want to thank you for stepping up also with a third program. One of the things that we're trying to emphasize more nowadays is that, you know, although neighborhood watch programs have gone away, that would have been a good resource for people to get information about such things.We are now encouraging more and more to our police department, community watch, neighborhood watch programs where you could get your neighbors, get updates on what's going around in your neighborhood in terms of public safety. But it's also a good avenue to talk about earthquake preparedness or disaster preparedness as a whole.So let me get your information and I will get back to you in them. And we have in the West Long Beach area, we had the West Long Beach Association. I would recommend that you attend one of those meetings.Our police officer and our neighborhood watch and our community watch person is always there to talk about what's going on in the neighborhood, in the area and give updates. So that would be I would strongly encourage you do that as well and we'll give you those dates when the West Palm Beach Association meets.Okay. Thank you.Thank you very much. That concludes we're going to take a roll call vote. Councilman Pierce. I'm sorry, district two. District three for.I.Okay. That's three, four.Five, six, seven, I eight and nine. Okay. That motion carries for the seat in front of the report. Thank you very much. We're going to item 36 now.\nSummary:", "answer": "Recommendation to receive and file a report from the City Manager on earthquake preparedness in Long Beach, including but not limited to the Alert Long Beach system, seismic studies of buildings in the city, and general readiness for natural disasters."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nTherefore, I very respectfully ask that you go ahead and permit APD to acquire a fixed and mobile automated license plate readers. I thank you very much for listening to my remarks.Thank you. Our next speaker.Marilyn Roffman.Good evening, Speaker Rothman.Hello again.I tapped into the same thing a previous.Speaker noticed in the first screen of the presentation. Why would.Anybody need to know whether some car.Hat was a resident.Or not? That has nothing to.Do with crime. Nothing. I find that the.These.Readers are totally.Detrimental to public privacy and will actually increase the police imprint, which I am against. Thank you.Thank you. Our next speaker.Michael Robert Long.Good evening. Speaker one This one.And you hear me?Yes, we can. Hi.Thank you, Mayor and council members. This past October, the presidents of 50 of our highways across Alameda met with this police chief. We asked him to address the unease that many in our nearly 7000 homeowner households felt about the crime happening all around our island community.Given that you have capped the storm ranks at 50 and 88 excuse me, more than a few presidents support the idea that to keep Alameda safe, the use of the technologies such as license plate readers is crucial. With some homeowners talking about moving to a safer city, we are at a tipping point.This is especially true here in Bay Farm, where increased auto steps have directly affected the number of our neighbors. With the support of my Board of Directors and as President of the 201 households in the Costa Brava Highway, I support implementing the Chief's plan to deploy Alpers with the caveat that the shelf life of that data collectedand its access are strictly controlled, as he has discussed. Thank you very much.Thank you. Let's see, we have yes, we have 12 minutes left. Okay. Let's get to our public speakers and then council. We need to take a housekeeping vote. And I want to commend all the public figures you're doing brilliantly at staying within your time limit.So thank you. Who's next?In a hurry.Koski welcomes Speaker Rakowski.I thank you. I am concerned. Yes, we are an island, and that is a strategic point. But we are not at war with our neighbors. And setting up license plate readers at the entrances and exits to the island give off a message of unwelcome that could have a negative impact on our residents and our businesses and ourcommunity and our values. This is an expensive proposal with questionable value, and I am also concerned that while it is being pitched to.Us to be able to solve.Dramatic missing persons and strong robberies, things of that sort that in fact caught up in the license plate, readers will be struggling folks with unpaid parking tickets or with their vehicle registration behind in these hard times. And I'm not seeing protections built into the policy that the goal is that this is being.Sold.For our community towards actually going to be how this program would be utilized, especially given sort of recent experiences with the mobile license plate readers. So a lot of questions and I am looking forward to a more complete analysis on privacy coming back to council.Thank you.Thank you. Our next speaker.Melody Montgomery.Hey.Good evening. Speaker Montgomery.Good evening. Thank you for having me. First of all, thank you for Jennifer. To Jennifer, for all her words, she just spoke. I agree with everything she just said. A Alpers don't stop crime. They're not a they're not anything that stop crimes.And as you'll see the analysis, look more and look deeper into it, you'll find the same numbers that we found. They make it makes citizens feel like they're watching. Like are we living in an oral society where Big Brother is just going to.Have eyes on all the time? We're leaving the island. We're coming back to the island. We're leaving the island or coming back to the island.It's not a comfortable feeling, and it's not.Some place that you makes you feel like home. Typically, these things have also been placed in targeted neighborhoods where we'll be placed the east side, the west side. I think you already know. Citizens. Alameda do not need to be monitored like that.I'm going to respond to something, things that the chief said about knowing when stolen.Vehicles are on our island.But then he said that we wouldn't they wouldn't be using the information unless a crime was done first. So there was confusion just in his presentation about how the data will be used and where it would be used.Yeah. So I think we need a deeper policy and we need to know.More about that.That it's already confusing. So once again, these do not prevent crime. And so I'm asking you just to say no.Just say no to a alpers. Thank you.Thank your next speaker.Laura. Katrina.Did you speak to Katrina?Then I couldn't find the mute button.You found it?I found it. I also want to encourage a on the Alpers. I know in the past there was an article that came out last year that APD was surveilling our community, using facial recognition, disregarding counsel's direction, and that was with the Clearview technology.And the article broke through like a national news cycle. And that's not something that I think the Alameda needs to be known for. Right. So I, I have doubts about the use of the use. And I could see there being poor judgment and misuse of this really sensitive information.Additionally, the Electronic Frontier Foundation says that this data and it makes sense campaign in an intimate picture of the driver's life. And so it can be used to target drivers who visit sensitive places like health centers, immigration clinics, funerals, protests, etc., etc., religious houses of worship.And so, again, I want to also understand what is this going to be used for? I think that they're what I've heard in other speakers, like there's fears about crime and there's this people are revealing they're experiencing more crime to the point that other speakers have made.Like, I don't believe that this is going to change the clearance rate of what APD is able to solve. And it's a reactive measure. It's not a proactive measure. And so I would recommend that we spend the money, the 500 to $700000, to reduce the root causes of what maybe some of these crimes are.Instead of using that money to surveil the community and create a state where we're being watched, because, again, to the point that I think Miss Montgomery made it, it doesn't feel like a place that I want to be.Thank you.Thank you. At this time, I know we've got one more public speaker, Madam Clerk. However, it's 1055, and we do need to take that vote. So could we please. So, Counsel, we have to be able to consider any new items after 11 p.m..We have to have a motion councilor and that's why it's got his hand up.I'm mean here, all the remaining items up until midnight and take another vote of midnight if we want to go for that.And this takes four votes to pass. Do we have a second to that? Councilmember de SAG. Going to midnight is your. Okay. You said it. Okay, madam, quickly. We have a real cover.Please disappear everyday.Shall I?Not quite. Sorry. Her expense account?No.You moved on my screen. Not right. Hi, Vela. I may, as Ashcroft know, that motion fails to do.Do we have a motion to perhaps.Get through.The regular calendar? Or anything else. Councilmember Harry Spencer.I'd like to finish this item.Well, we will finish this item. This is about whether we take another item after 11. So we don't have a motion to take another item after 11. Councilmember de SAC.Well, you know, seven A is a police matter. I'd love to take seven A as well. So that's my emotion.Okay to finish seven? Yeah. Okay. Anyone want to second Councilmember Jason's motion? Seeing no hands up and then no further motions. Madam Clerk, this means that we will complete this item. Correct. Subtract 660 and then. And we'll hear nothing further that requires vote.Correct. So you would just you've already heard same in their communications would be just sections nine and 11 that you would hear.Correct. All right. Okay. So back to our public speakers. Madam Clerk, I think, is even stranger. Yes.Yes.And and Speaker Graber has reappeared. So let's try and get her to we will welcome Speaker Estrela.Yes. Some of the speakers were figuring that maybe the PR was going to be at some fixed jail locations like at bridges. And this agenda item is just putting a L PR on police vehicles. So just to clarify that.But that's that's what you folks said earlier. The regarding the local resident box that eight years ago at 530 in the morning I was on my bicycle riding past a car that was broken into. So I called the Almeda Police and gave them the license plate.And about an hour later, they showed up and said, Oh, it was for a local resident and it was for that address. So they were able to contact the the owner of the residents there about the the car being broken into.So I just saying that that may be a way that the local resident box is used. I have no idea. But it sounds like that's more in the case filing the portion rather than an immediate return on an inquiry on the license plate.That's my $0.02. Thank you.Thank you. It just so as not to confuse the public. I do want to note that this is this item is a recommendation to provide directly to staff regarding the installation use of automated license plate readers, including fixed and mobile equipment on Alameda Police Department.Vehicles in the staff report lists out the actual fix the proposed fixed locations. Okay. Our next speaker is.Are you like her neighbor?She just disappeared. How does that happen? No. She's back. She's not. There you are. Welcome. Yay! You're unmuted.Hi. Good evening. I just want to say that I'm I'm really disappointed that it appears the council's not going to be taking action on this tonight. I think this has been going on for over three years. The council needs to face up and make a decision on this.I hope once you get this report from Mr. Cohen about allaying the privacy concerns that the council will move ahead and vote for this. It's not. I'm going to get the bad feeling that there are certain people on the council that just are philosophically against this, regardless of the benefits.That they may provide.To our citizenry. We really need to be thinking of protecting. The residents.Alameda residents, first of all.And I believe that there was a.What do you call it, a survey.On next door. And the survey.You've probably heard about it or seen it. The survey was 84% of the people want the readers.Only 16 are against it. Now, I know tonight the speakers.Were more like 5050, but that does not portray. The general residents of Alameda.Okay.That's my take on it. Thank you very much.Thank you. All right. And we finished our public speakers have smoker, correct? All right. So with that, I will close public comment on item six C and we'll take it back to the.To.The Council.For.Discussion direction. So again, this is we're being asked to provide direction to staff regarding the installation and use of a as Vice Mayor de.I have a couple of concerns. One is I thought that we gave pretty clear direction in the December 2019 meeting about the privacy issue, making sure that we had a privacy policy in place and that we would be following the San Francisco public privacy policy in the interim.And so I just I'm a little worried that we're we're undoing an act of the council. And I thought that that was pretty clear direction that was given. And if our meeting minutes don't reflect the the audio, I mean, I'll go back and pull the audio clips if need be.But I'm just I'm concerned that we're undoing an act of council relative to that. The second thing is, and I'll make this very clear, I've made this clear in pretty much every meeting that we've had on Alpers. And I feel like this is maybe the third or fourth time this has come back while I've been on council, that this has nothing to do with whether or not I trust our current chief. I trust our current chief. I like our current Chief. I will continue to trust until I have reason to not. That said, I am philosophically opposed to Alpers and philosophically opposed to them because the data shows that they are not efficient or effectiveagainst crime fighting. And in fact, I think what we do see is that they cost a lot of money. And I you know, I do worry about the kind of placebo effect of spending money on technology that is not going to be as effective as we say it is.I do think that we have given money to our police officers. I've certainly been supportive in that regard of making sure that our police department has funding to fill vacancies and that we are doing everything that we can to not only fill vacancies, but to fill them with quality officers and to give them training and all ofthe things that we need to to to have a good police force. So I just my concern remains the same, which is that I think that this sort of technology creates a lot of opportunities for abuse of power that I that I do not want to support and I cannot support.And I don't really understand that there is really no data to show that they are a deterrent other than kind of the anecdotal things that we hear. So I am just, you know, my position hasn't changed. I've waited for for data and studies that really show otherwise.My privacy concerns, my concerns about privacy remain. I do want to see staff movement on those policies. I understand that there were issues even relative to our existing mobile. ALPERS There were some with the previous privacy policy that had been proposed and staff was going to work through those issues.And I look forward to that policy coming back and being finalized that we're not kind of stuck in this limbo of using the San Francisco policy in the interim. But that's where I'm at. This is nothing. This is not a statement on whether or not I trust our police chief.I just really do not support this. I think this is a large expenditure and I don't know that we're going to get our money's worth, and I don't know that we're going to see the deterrents that we expect.Thank you.Thank you. I consider her a Spencer.Thank you, Mayor. First of all, I want to thank all the public comments and all of the emails. And I know this is a controversial issue. I want to thank our chief for all of his work. And I want to thank our former chief, Paul Larry, who brought this while I was mayor.And at that time, yeah, well, I wanted to I wanted to quote him to make sure I have it here. So back in looking at an article from February seven, 2018 online, and what he said then is, quote, This is chief power.Larry, if there are people in the room who are concerned that the police department is racially profiling folks, here is the tool that does not do that. It doesn't care what Larry said. It doesn't have the ability to racially profile.And I remember him saying it at the time, and I and I've heard similar comments. You know what what these things can and cannot do. And I do support the chief's recommendation. My understanding, Chief, is your first and even as listed on the staff.Alternative one. I understand that. That's actually your right. Your first ask is direct staff to move forward with the next step in implementation of fixed airports and revamping and expanding the Mobile Dale PR program. So in your professional opinion, is that your primary ask of counsel tonight?Yes, that's correct.Right. So I would that would be my motion to move forward in that. And Chief, could you explain so in regards to what does that actually look like to move forward? You mean would you all be coming back?Would you be coming back at some point in the near future? What does your timeline look like?Good achieve Joshi.Sir, I was trying to get off it so I would take guided direction from from council on on next steps. But what I my my recommendation is that we move forward with being able to install the equipment, the camera, the clippers at the at the fixed locations that are that are designated and in the staff report.May I?You may continue. Cancer. Cancer. Thank you.And so do you need additional funding and approval? Because I know back in the day we approved, I believe, 500,000. When Chief Larry was here.So I think that cost with sickness it would would be significantly less. As I've done more recent research, I think I don't have exact dollar amount, but I think it would be somewhere. There are 13 locations where we want to where we would install the cameras.And each camera is $2,750 a year for the first year, and then it drops down to $2,500 a year per camera. So if we have 13 locations and we installed one at each location, it's I think it's around 35 or $36,000.And then regards you.Have this work ahead.Thank you. And in regards to the mobile units.So the mobile units, they are a about $200 per vehicle per month.All right. Thank you very much, Chief. So I have made a motion there was discussion regarding this privacy program or just I'm not really sure what a privacy impact report that the prior counsel had requested, I believe I'm not really sure, but it looks like I've heard from attorneys saying that they think it's the work that's alreadybeen discussed satisfies it. However, I am happy to someone that as part of the A friendly amendment, I'm happy to entertain what that looks like. I'm not really sure what it is so far, but I did make a motion to move his first request.Thank you.We can have a fifth. There's a second for that and then we'll have discussion. I will let you know that I'm not supporting that motion and I'm guessing that you don't have three votes. I could be wrong. But Councilmember Desai, did you want to speak at this time or should I.Be more than happy to speak? The necessity of license plate readers has been expressed by various councils and and police chiefs and and residents over a long period of time. I recall attending a meeting with Council member Lina Tam.I believe it was in 2013. It could have been 2014 and and Chief Noonan could have been the police chief at the time. I can't quite remember if it was 2014 or 2013. And it was a meeting held at Bayport in the west end of town.And, you know, mentioned was made up of the the use of license plate readers. And as a result, you know, we did have a discussion about that in city council. And over the years, certainly when and that was when Mary Gilmer was mayor and then certainly when Trish.Councilmember Herrera Spencer was mayor. We certainly had that conversation then as well. I think the time of license plate readers, whether there are fixed or placed on on mobile vehicles. I think the time has come in the period of time between 2013, 2014 and today, the way in which crime is occurring.Throughout, you know, the United States, but but including here in the Bay Area, including here in Alameda, is so vastly different and more sophisticated, especially in the turn in the use of social media. I mean, work up until recently, we were at our wit's end, you know, trying to deter or stop capture, you know, people who weredoing these wild drag races over at Alameda Point. And clearly, certainly in parts of east end of town, there is crime that's going on and it's crime of a sophisticated nature. Just only recently, there was like, I don't know what you call it, bum mass of people who had broken into a medical marijuana place on the eastend of town. And then they coordinated it to break it on the west end of town. And the very same night and on the very same night that they broke in on the west end of town, they came back one hour later and I heard them breaking into.And I think we're at a point in time where we not only have to, you know, finally fulfill the vacated position, unfilled positions in our police department that we're beginning to fill. And there was a great event last week, by the way, in the hiring of three new police officers.But we not only need to fill those unfilled positions and provide the officers with the proper training, but we also need to give them the tools. And that's all. LPR Cars are automated license plate readers. They're just tools to help our police.You know, improve the way in which they either deter crime or if crime happens, capture the people who perpetrate crimes. They're not perfect tools. And I don't think we're at a point where we can wait seven more years in hopes of finding the perfect tool, to be sure.\nSummary:", "answer": "Recommendation to Provide Direction to Staff Regarding the Installation and Use of Automated License Plate Readers (ALPR), including Fixed and Mobile Equipment on Alameda Police Department Vehicles. (Police 10031110) [Continued from December 7, 2021]"}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nReport from Public Works recommendation to receive supporting documentation, including the petitions into the record. Conclude the public hearing and request the City Attorney to prepare an amendment to the Long Beach Municipal Code to establish preferential Parking District AC as recommended by the City Traffic Engineer District seven.Assistant City Manager Mollica.Thank you, Vice Mayor, again. The staff presentation will be given by Ora Malloy and our Director of Public Works.Vice Mayor Lowenthal, tall and honorable council members. The item before you is a similar item as hearing. Number one, there is a request to establish a permit parking district in Council District seven permit permit permit district called AC.So the residents of the west side of Cherry Avenue between Roosevelt Road and Marshall Place and Marshall Place between Cherry Avenue and Gardenia Avenue, has requested the establishment of a new professional parking district to seek on street parking relief due to overflow parking generated by employees of businesses located along the east side of Cherry Avenue.The residents have also requested that a 30 minute parking restriction from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Sunday except holidays be established within the proposed permit parking district permit parking study was concluded was conducted by staff during the peak periods of activity on Cherry and it was revealed that 75% of existing on street parking spaces withina two block area were occupied at the time of the survey were that was the first test. In addition, we determined that 59% of the vehicles parked were not from the residents and from the outside of the neighborhood.A petition formally requesting the establishment with a 30 minute parking restriction was received by the city, a copy of it which is attached as Exhibit A. We conducted the review of the petition. It showed that 76% of the residents are in favor of implementing a permit parking district and the proposed parking restrictions in order to prevent parkingspillover in the blocks adjacent to the proposed permit parking district. The city traffic engineer is proposing to expand the district to include several other streets. The streets are Cherry Avenue, Gardenia Avenue, Roosevelt Road and Bixby Road. Residents of these streets were informed of the proposal by mail and feedback was requested.These streets in the proposal expansion will not include signage or parking restriction at this time. However, by including the streets in the permit parking district, the residents could request parking restrictions in the future. Through a well-supported petition, the city traffic engineer has reviewed the results of the parking study, the resident petition and the feedback responses from themailing, and has determined that the area qualifies for establishment of a permanent permit district. This concludes my report and we're here to answer any questions.Thank you, Mr. Malloy and Councilmember Turanga. Okay. Is there any member of the public that wishes to address Council on hearing item two? This is on the parking. Please come forward and state your name.Good evening and thank you for listening. My name's Rama. Cool. I live at 3959 Cherry Avenue and been there for the past 30 years. It's only been within the last three years that we've had the parking situation. That's why we haven't been involved asking for this sooner.Some of the problems that have arised is if you move your car, there's no place to come back to. The other thing is, is it employees that are parking on that street are now jaywalking across Cherry to get to their prospective business openings.And it's going to come down to where somebody is going to get killed out here on that street. They just come out of those bushes and there's been more than once that somebody is almost run over somebody. So we need to do something.And I think this is the right way to do it that we can get. The owners of the companies to understand. They got to work with their employees for the parking and try to get them on that safe side of the street for them.There's not much else I can say to stop. You guys go with it and it'd be great for us. Thank you.Thank you, sir.Hi. My name is Cynthia Hindu. Burka and I have resided in the seventh District for 34 years. I have investment properties on Cherry It be south of Bixby. I became informed about this over the next door neighbor website when people were talking over the holidays about this meeting coming up.Up until this point, I have not been notified that this was an issue or being brought to the city council of this permit parking. Although my addresses for my investment properties are not included in that, I am very concerned about the over spillage that will come down cherry and affect my property as well.That car dealers that are across the street from my properties. Whenever my tenants have complained about the people parking there, they've always been very responsive in moving their cars. But I am very concerned that that property owners all along the frontage of Cherry were not notified.I also find other discrepancies about the signage that happens on Cherry. It seems like from north of Bixby to Carson on Cherry, they're allowed to park on the wrong side of the street, only during sweeps street sweets tripping days.But the rest of cherry is not allowed to do that. And I'd like to know why the neighborhoods are separated like that, why one part is getting attention and the other part is not getting attention with street sweeping and this preferential parking.My understanding from listening to the next door neighbors talk about this is that not they're not aware of the fact that the property owners are the ones that have to pay for this permit parking and that a lot of those homes are rentals.And so as property owners, we did not know about that. That means that any fees are going to come across, are coming to us, not to the renters. So I don't know where I can get more information on this or, you know, how all the property owners are going to be made aware of this because all acherry is affected.So I can certainly have staff touch base with you, Mr. Malloy, and after the presentation will either speak with you directly or send one of his staff members to speak with you.Okay.Thank you. Okay. So your greatest concern was notification.Notification.And the.Spillage of the employees that are going to continue to park down the other parts of cherry because it's still the frontage. Okay. Understood.Thank you. Sir.My name is Mark Helmke. I'm a 25 year resident of the the area that you describe. Unfortunately, I am on the next street. I'm on Rose. I'm not on gardening and I'm not on Cherry. So in the earlier in the earlier presentation, one of the gentlemen made a big point of saying that Lakewood Village had preferential parking. And then what happened was the parking situation just migrated to the south. Well, the students that parking in the in the previous district, they're students. They have an option to park in the parking structures. And it's more secure.It's safer for all the reasons that were identified. My question to the council is. Just like squeezing a balloon. If we're going to put permits, if we're going to require permits to park on Cherry and Gardenia, why are we doing that?If it's to accommodate employees of surrounding businesses that have been there as long as we have? They're not going to go on the other side of the they're not going to go on to the rail yard where the lumber is.They're just going to come further and deeper into the neighborhood. It's just like squeezing a balloon in the middle. The air doesn't go out of it. It just moves to a different area. So it seems to me that the issue is not.Permitting the parking. It seems to me the issue is revising the zoning to require parking. Of the businesses that are there for their employees on the southwest corner, Cherry and Carson, there's a there's a U-Haul that's been there 25 years.It's full of U-Haul trucks. The people that rent the trucks park in the neighborhood, the people that attend that work at the businesses on the east, on the west side of Cherry I'm sorry, on the east side of Cherry, if they're not already provided parking, where are they going to go?Not on Cherry if it's permitted, not on Gardenia if it's permitted. But they're going to come to my house. So I think it has to be a greater picture that you have to take into account. The other thing is, is that I got several notices in the last couple, three weeks, and every single one of them, thearea that was bounded, was incorrectly indicated as clerk. So I think that a little more needs to be done with regard to serving others in the neighborhood and and the notification this needs to be, I think, continued to another date.Thank you, sir. Any other members of the public that wish to address the Council on this item.I'm not a resident, Shirley Brassard, but I have service that area in the last three, four years for the homeless population. And just listening to this discussion tonight, I don't get the feeling that it has been thought out.You're addressing college students for Cal State, for Lombard City College, which is on Clark. As you walk down, Carson, you run right into Clark Avenue and then to stretch that permit all the way to Cherry Avenue. I don't believe you have very many students except those who live near Cherry Avenue, who are walking from Cherry to Clarkto get to school. That seems like a very large area to ask people to have permits to park. And to use the school as as the reason why it seems like you're separating your community where in the long run it's going to backfire in some way.This just doesn't sound right. If I'm asking council members, have you walked the circumference or driven the circumference of area that's being entertained here from Cherry Avenue to Clark?You're confusing.That's your. Mike's not on, but it's. It's a separate motion. Okay. Yes, but thank you. Next speaker, please.Hello.I wasn't really going to come.Out here and speak, but none of our group, they are getting cameras or whatever, so I'm going to.Speak for them. Um.My name is Linda Rendell. My address used to be 3923 Cherry Avenue. My mom's lived there. There she is right there since 1965. And what the main problem is, what we're trying to say is the residents in front of the service street right there on Cherry.They have no place to park. I go over there a lot and there's no place to park during the daytime.My mom goes to the grocery store.There's no place to park where.She can, you know, park in the middle of the street and take her groceries inside. So we don't have driveways, we only have an alley. And that's clogged up, too. So what we're just trying to say is it's been like three years now.It's the Volkswagen Place across the street and they do have lots in the back where their employees can park. So there is the businesses over there. They have they don't have to park on cherry. They have parking area in their lots.And there and and like my neighbor said, they are walking across Cherry Avenue in the middle of traffic. And if you've ever been down Cherry, it's very congested and they just walk into traffic and something is going to happen if they don't.And the police, they don't seem to to care if they jaywalk. So I'm just kind of speaking for them and they've been trying to do this for a long time now, and I hope you guys pull with them.And since you're representing the group. Yes, we do. It's not that hard, guys, to get up there and talk. And you're doing beautifully. So are you. Would you say that the group is in support of the motion? Yes.Oh, yes, very much so.I just want to be sure you're reflecting there.Yeah.They're not there's.Not as many as we wanted to show up, but yeah, we're in support of it, so.Thank you, guys. Thank you. And I appreciate that. This is probably the first time each of you has spoken before city council and you did wonderfully. And. And that's that's what civic participation is about coming out for the things that matter to you.I am going to if there are no further if there is no further public comment, I'd like to turn it behind the dais. Councilmember Urunga.Thank you, Vice Mayor. Mr. Malone, could you summarize again the issue that we are being faced with tonight? I think there's some confusion out there as to what this proposal does for the community, for Cherry Street. Jerry. I mean.Absolutely honorable. You rung up the item before you. It's similar to item number one. I think there's a confusion that we're talking about a huge geographical area. The question the area that's in question is Cherry Avenue for two blocks between Bixby and Roosevelt and Roosevelt to Marshall.This is in front of the car dealership. The residents were requesting that a permit parking be established in order to prevent the employees of this dealership parking in front of their homes. We have gone one step beyond and as one of the gentlemen explained about the squeezing the balloon.We know that there could be some spillway. We're proposing that we expand the the permit parking zone, one more block all the way to Gardena. And this this will allow for future residents in if they feel that there is parking problems in front of their homes, they can request the petition.We need to receive minimum. Well, there are two tests that we do in order to establish a permit parking zone. One is that 75% of spaces has to be occupied. When we do the survey. So that means at the peak hours, whatever the peak permit, peak parking is, there has to be 75% of all available parking onthat street occupied. And second test is 50% of those vehicles have to be outside of that neighborhood. We will check the license plates for each car. And if 50% or.More.Are parkers outside of that neighborhood, then this qualifies for a permit parking district. So we also have to recognize that these are single family homes. They all should have parking spaces in their garages and their driveways. So it gets very difficult to justify in most districts a permit parking zone.So this this district qualified, which is on cherry, we also we asked the neighbors to participate if they want to expand this, but they're not going to have any signage. They don't have to pay for it. It will be only for residents that are facing on cherry that will pay if they want to have a parking spacereserved. But residents on Gardena don't have to do anything at this point. They don't have to pay for any permits. If they choose to expand their district, then it's administrative. We don't have to come to city council because you're establishing the district.We have to establish that first. That 50% or more of parkers are not residents and 75% of spaces are occupied during our peak parking area. I don't know if I explained or clarified the issue that you asked.Yeah, I think that basically that in summary, the affected parking spots that we're talking about are on Cherry Avenue. There's no spillage into the neighbors neighboring streets. I'm Gardenia or Rose. It's basically the most affected area is on Cherry.Now, we did hold a number of community meetings, including the residents along that Cherry Avenue, including the business owners at the car dealerships across the street. We did talk about the parking situation in regards to their employees being having access to parking in their own facility.And that was addressed. However, there was the number of employees based on the number of parking spots available within their their business area, their locations. It was not enough. So there were there is a spillage and that affected the neighborhoods.And that's where and that's what brought us to today. So I want to thank you, first of all, Mr. Malloy, and for facilitating these meetings, and also Hector Rivas and Ignacio Ochoa for also working with our office and working with the neighbors and with the businesses to address this issue for you residents who are here tonight.Thank you for your patience. I know it's been an arduous journey to get to this point. This has been a problem for a number of years now. This is a point where we're hoping it will address your concerns with parking and that the contentious situation that we have with those businesses throughout the street will, if not goaway, at least be minimized to to a very low, low point where there's practically nothing there. So I do ask that my council colleagues support this motion and that we're able to move forward with this in. And finally, I want to also congratulate.Aaron Malloy in on his appointment to the city of Pasadena. This is his last council meeting here tonight. Very good report. Although you had to do it twice, but that's okay. Sometimes these could get confusing. And I want to thank you for being here tonight, this evening, for sharing your thoughts on this very important issue to you. Thank you.Are we clapping that he's leaving?Heck, no.Thank you, Councilmember. You're on it. Councilman Austin, would you like to address this motion? Councilman Austin. Would you? Did you want to address the motion? You're the seconder. No, that's okay. Thank you. Thank you. Members of the public, for your comments.And members, cast your vote.Motion carries.Thank you. And we are at the time where we take public comment. I have six speakers who have signed up. Kenneth Roth.\nSummary:", "answer": "Recommendation to receive supporting documentation, including the petitions, into the record, conclude the public hearing, and request City Attorney to prepare an amendment to the Long Beach Municipal Code, to establish Preferential Parking District “AC” as recommended by the City Traffic Engineer.

With item eight, please.Report from Financial Man Financial Management Recommendation Refer to hearing officer the Business License Application Denial Appeal by JP 23, Hospitality Company located at 110 East Broadway Avenue, District one.Okay. Let's go to staff report, please.Good evening, Mayor and members of City Council. The Department of Financial Management determined it was appropriate as well as required per our duty given by the Long Beach Municipal Code to deny the business license for JP 23 Hospitality, Inc.The business owner followed the process afforded within the Long Beach Municipal Code to appeal. The action before you is for the City Council to consider whether to hear the entire case or refer it to a hearing officer also allowed within the Long Beach Municipal Code.It is staff's recommendation that you refer it to the hearing officer selected by the city clerk's office. And that concludes my report. Both myself and Deputy City Attorney Art Sanchez are available for questions.Thank you. We're going to go to public comment. We see 11 speakers, so we got to 90 seconds. So could Steven Tillet, Jacob Pusey, Carla Curtis, Melander come forward. I'll read the next few just so they can be ready.Samantha Perez. Anthony Hale. Eric Williams. Gurjit Badel. Michelle C, Jackie Cordova, Perla de and Zwei Roybal. So starting with Steven Tillett, you have.Four men, okay. Good evening. Members of the council. I would say, Mayor, but so why I'm here. My name is Stephen Killing. I'm the executive director of a nonprofit called Elad, which stands for Effort, Love, Action and Determination.I'm originally from New Jersey. Ten years ago, I met Mr. Keller. And ever since I've met this man. Things have changed. Not just for myself, but almost everybody around him. What he's able to do in a community. To help that community.Is who he is. Now, I know that you guys don't know him personally. And what he's entrusted me with as the executive director of a nonprofit is to be able to reach out to different communities. Sort of like a liaison.And I do this for him without pay. And I do this because Mr. Pools and Carlos, one of our biggest donors. With the caveat that we do work in the areas where he has businesses. So what we do is we come in and we attempt to make a relationship with all of you, with the police, with theRecreation Department, which we have reached out to a friend of mine. Her name is Ashley Gazette. I'm sure some of you probably know who she is, and she can vouch for the fact that months ago we reached out in order to try and help, because Eli's focus is the youth of the communities.We believe in helping the youth in the different communities. So with time running out, I'd just like to say, I don't know what your process is, but I do know who this man is. And I can tell you he is exactly the type of business owner that you want in your community.He is exactly the type of man that you want to have a business because he does ingratiate himself into the community. That's part of the family.Thank you.Thank you. Next is Jacob from DeKalb.Hi. Good afternoon, city mayor. Mayor Garcia. City Councilman. City Councilwoman. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to speak on behalf of the 70 employees of JP 23. My name is Jacob Carver. I am the founder of JP 23 Hospitality Company.Being born and raised in Montreal, Canada, it was always been my dream to open an entertainment venue in the city of Long Beach. Four years ago, that dream became one step closer. I saw potential in a rundown location that was closed for many years.Here I am for nearly four years later, surviving and trying to hold on to that dream. I spent nearly $3.5 million in that location, and many 18 hour days have passed. For the past four years, we in the restaurant industry, if you don't mind, or if my staff stand up all the 70, that's just a fraction ofthe people that work at JP 23. Now we at we probably endured one of the we probably one industries that were hit the worst during the pandemic. At what one point I was given, I was going to pull the plug on the whole project and I decided to go through with it.Now here I am confused why I was having difficulty entering delays and trying to get my business license first and then now the entertainment permit. This is an entertainment venue and I can't operate without an entertainment permit. Why?We were denied a temporary entertainment permit as the municipal code allows us to have. So now wait. Why? Okay. Hardworking people that include. Why are we going to the snap? How to stop a finger, get rid of all these jobs, of all these hardworking people that include single parents, students, all walks of life.Sir, your time has expired.I just ask for this hearing to be heard in front of city council instead of the public officer just to have a fair chance at us. Thank you. Thank you so much.Thank you. Curtis Millender. After. Curtis is Samantha Perez, then Anthony Hill. Curtis.Good evening, counsel. My name is Curtis Melander. Really quick. I met Jacob ten years ago. And Jeff, I know he's been a big factor in my family's life as well as mine. So I know all his employees and everybody else.He's a big service to everybody. So I just want to, you know, make sure to accept that we get a fair shot. So thank you.Thank you. Next to Samantha Perez and then Anthony Hill and then Eric Williams. I'm say Samantha, not here. Okay, Anthony Hill, you're up. Okay. Anthony Hill. Not here. Eric Williams.Hello. Good evening. I'm Eric Williams. I bring a lot of entertainment to JP 23, and I'm an artist myself. I've made records with Dr. Dre and everybody back in 87. So. That Dr. Dre shook night area that's overweight that's just in the past now that the puffy era the the the type of business the type of entertainmenthe's trying to bring is this clean rap, this clean R&B. And that's what we've been doing lately. You know, is is has been not one problem. And I've seen I don't been through the the ship ignite the death row era.I didn't seen all of it. But this guy JP 23 that the club is bringing clean entertainment and that's all I have been since I've been going up there. So just like the other guy say, I just want him to get his shot because I it's been it's been it's been okay since I've been seeing it.Thank you.Thank you. Next is Gurjit Ba Dal, then Michelle C, then Jackie Cordova.Good afternoon, City Council. My name is Gurjit. I'm actually a dear friend of Jacob. I've known him for about nine and a half, ten years. Also, just like you can tell, he's a very supportive friend. Also, I eventually started working with him.He helped me start a marketing company in the past year during COVID. I also had a hard time with COVID, with my personal business. I was a wedding photographer and that went under and Jacob supported me and helped me put me back on my feet.So I'm very grateful to him in that aspect. But over the last year and a half, working with him and seeing him, how he is with the staff, his family, you know, he is a very caring person, does care about his business, puts his all into it, is very transparent, who has his heart on his sleeve, knowingwhat's going on. I also like to say that, you know, we're a community and a lot happened in the past few years with COVID. We should look at supporting the businesses and businessmen, putting money into Long Beach if you know, there's some process that wasn't done the way that was supposed to or not.I know Jacob's done everything in his power to try to get the the licenses and whatnot. But, you know, as you can see, many businesses have gone under during COVID. I want to say that we are a community.We should help each other. And, you know, instead of trying to stop his business and operation, we should advise and let him know the right processes and what you guys would like us to do to help get this business back to the track that we're looking to.All we're trying to do is bring, you know, beautiful entertainment and a beautiful bar to the city of Long Beach. So I hope that you guys would give him a fair chance. Thank you.Thank you. Next as Michelle sees and Jackie Cordova and then pro.Hello, everyone. My name is Michelle Castillo. I am from the Hashemite Nation. I come representing my elders, my Hashemite elders, and also my tongva elders. Just a reminder that you are on Tongva land. And I'd like to acknowledge my ancestors.We are community. This. These women behind me. Our community. The men with us are true community. I am a land protector, a sacred site protector and ocean protector. And I stand with missing and murdered indigenous women. What's going on with JP 23?They made a mess in Orange County, California, in Fullerton. Rape people were drugged. People are getting beat up at that club and now they're coming into precious tongva land. Hashim Inland, the land of my ancestors. And the same mess that happened in Fullerton is going to happen in the city of Long Beach.And I'm just here again representing the elders of Long Beach and asking you to please deny their license. All my relations.Thank you. Next is Jackie Cordova, then Perla de Way, Red Ball.Thank you. Good evening, Community. I am Jackie Cordova. I am a mother of Santa Ana. I am here for our daughters. I'm here for the protection of our women and children. I am here as a voice for the missing and murdered indigenous women of this tongva nation.For several months, we have been standing up and raising attention to the 40 plus allegations of sexual assaults, drugging, kidnaping and rape stemming from JP 23 Urban Kitchen Restaurant Bar in Fullerton. Our latest protest was held at the Fullerton Police Department for their lack of safety concern for our safety.We stand with the victims. We believe them. We give them courage to come forward. April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, an annual campaign to raise public awareness about sexual assault and educate communities and individuals and how to prevent sexual violence.We demand an end to rape culture. We came tonight to warn Long Beach about JP 23, hospitality company trying to establish business. We demand safety for our children, for our businesses and our communities. We urge you to fully investigate these applicants as they come forward.Thank you.Thank you. Next, this property.Good evening, Long Beach. My name is.Burleigh.I also am a mother in Santa Ana on August 2nd, 2021. Our news broke out that a 22 year.Old student.Was brutally raped.And left naked in.A parking structure down the street from JP 23. She had only been a JP 23 and didn't have that much to drink, so it was suspicious as to why she couldn't remember anything. I decided to pull up to the first rally that was outside.As a mother of a 25 year old young woman who has also been a victim of.Sexual assault.And a mother of a Navy veteran. I understand this kind of violence. So I'm here to warn Long Beach about what's about to break out if you allow this man to open business. 40 plus people have come forward, women that have had half a drink at his bar and not remembered where they have been.People that have walked into a room.Full with condoms and tampons and pads and.Undergarments. So I am pissed.But my anger is not just mine. My anger comes with 500 years of age.Thank you. Robert Gribble, our final speaker.Hello. My name is José Wrobel Castle. My traditional name is out there. We all wish we were. It means one that people know before they meet her. The reason I bring up my parents and my last name, my mother is Roy Rosemary Roybal.My father is Richard Dean Cassell. The reason I bring them up is because they met here in Long Beach many, many years ago. I'm here to stand together and in support of the 40 women. Are survivors. I'm a mother.I'm a daughter. I'm a big advocate for my w. I have a tattoo on the side of my head to let women know that I am a safe place for them. And so I am standing here for that reason tonight to use my voice as an entertainer.As an entertainer, as a mother, as a daughter, as a sister, as an ex-wife. And as a grandmother, I stand in support of these women. And I ask you to please reconsider this, because if this has happened in Fullerton, I can guarantee that it will probably happen here as well.And we don't need bad business like that, especially if I'm going to show up in the entertainment business and accidentally bump elbows with folks like that. It's not a good idea. So I ask you, on behalf of the women that have survived this and other women that haven't come forward to please stop the madness and google myw if you guys want to know what it is. Stands for murdered missing indigenous women. And it also covers our children and our men.Thank you, Councilwoman Zendejas.My name's Samantha.Perez. Sorry, I was. Do I still have time to talk?Were you seen around?Okay. Yeah. Okay. I think you're on the list.Yeah, I'm definitely on the list.Go for it.Okay. So my name is Samantha Perez.I'd like to.Just give a.Little quick background. I started working at JP 23 in Fullerton. I just want.To you know, I'm a woman. I'm also a mother.I started working at JP 23 in Fullerton when I was 21. He gave me an opportunity. I was a college student. I worked there for probably about four years. I paid my way through college working there.And no.Debt, which is always nice and flash forward to graduating going into a different sort of industry. Human Resources. I now came back to work for JP 23 because this is a family owned establishment and it's unfortunate. I worked at other bars in Fullerton and it's unfortunate that this happens in college towns, but it has nothing to dowith Jacob as a person. It has absolutely nothing to do with our bar. We employ 60% of women. He makes sure every night that we're getting walked to our car by bouncers. I it's okay. I don't want anyone to assume anything based off.Of what you've.Heard, because I am a woman and I have a child, and it has absolutely nothing to do with that. It has everything to do with the city and the way that all of the bars are necessary. If I would have anything to do with the bars, it has in my opinion, it's unfortunate that college towns that thishappens, but that somebody who's just a really terrible person and has horrible morals that is going to take advantage.Of all women.We do our best as a woman. I've done my best to make sure that all of the women in our establishment are safe. So I won't tolerate that. This is my main goal. Even in Long Beach. I do want smart and sorry I'm a woman.I'm going to make sure that, you know, all the women stay safe. Leaving are that woman. Thank you. Thank you.All right. Thank you very much. Councilwoman Zendaya's, you have the floor.Thank you. My smear. Obviously, I am not in the business of denying, you know, business license to people. You know, one of the things I pride myself in is to uplift our businesses that are in existence. I want to thank everybody who who came out to to do their public comments.I really appreciate that. But I really would like to ask city staff if you could just go step by step on telling us or identifying why this business was denied. And also, if you could also clarify what this is for today.Today we are we are making a decision whether to refer this to a hearing officer. And if you could please, you know, reiterated in your words, please.Council member. Yes. This evening. The item before you this evening is to refer recommendation of staff is to refer the item to a hearing officer to hear the item. The denial of the business license. If council chooses to do that, then it would be sent to a hearing officer to be heard.A decision would be rendered by the hearing officer which could or could not come back to council, depending on whether it's appealed by either the applicant. So that's what's before the city tonight. If the city were to choose not to send to a hearing officer and and hear it as a council body, you could do that.But that would not happen this evening. It would be rescheduled at a future date.Thank you. Can you give us I know you can't give us too much information, but can you give us what has led to this decision to deny the license? Oh. Or is that part of because it's not part of what we're talking about in the item tonight.So Councilwoman, to answer your question, the I guess basis for the denial of the business license application for GP 23 Hospitality Company was based on violations of the municipal code and I don't want to get too specific, but operating without permits issued to the city I guess is at best basic, as I can put it.Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Allen.Yes. Thank you, vice mayor. I just think tonight's item is pretty simple. It's just a referral to the business appeal to a city hearing officer who will then make the recommendation to the city council. All right, that's that's the way I'm seeing this.This location, JP 23, was in my district before redistricting, and I also live very close to JP 23. And I know that we have received well over 100 emails regarding this this location. And it's a lot. It was a lot.So I know that District one is now handling that regarding, you know, just just different various complaints, which are is concerning and also the fact that, you know, I'm a big supporter of businesses. There's no one that's a bigger supporter than me.And but, you know, there are rules that have to be followed. Everyone should be abide by the rules. And having proper permits and and things like that are seemed like pretty easy to do and all the businesses I've owned in the city.So I don't know why this this operator hasn't done that, but nevertheless, I think it's going to be I look forward to hearing seeing the recommendation from the city's hearing officer. And I also appreciate everyone that spoke tonight to.Thank you.And if I could just clarify that it would be sent to a hearing officer. The clerk maintains a list of independent hearing officers, and it's selected randomly. So it's not a city employee who's a hearing officer just for the public.It is a hearing officer that is selected to hear the matter and then would render a decision.Thank you for that clarification.Thank you, Councilman Austin.Thank you. I was away when this item was was presented in the restroom, but I wanted to just just get a sense of what the process is. So to go to an independent hearing officer, the hearing officer will make their recommendations.Will it come back to the city council?Thank you. Councilmember The answer is it could come back to the hearing, to the if it's appealed, if the decision of the hearing officers appealed, then it would come back to the city council.Okay. And maybe I just need a little bit more because, you know, I've been downtown. I've seen this business obviously operating for for some time now, a few months. And, you know, I do respect the the investment that anybody puts into our city.I want to want to kind of I don't know if we need to do that tonight, but at some point kind of walk through, you know, how somebody can can invest as much money as they have and then get to this point right.Where the city is potentially.So just just briefly.Councilman Aspen, I just wanted to clarify. So what is before you tonight is decision whether or not to refer this matter to a hearing officer. Ultimately, the city council is the trier of fact in this situation and in its referral of the hearing to a hearing officer.That hearing officer will conduct the hearing. They were rendered decision, I believe it's 15 days following the termination of the hearing. That decision will be put on council's agenda and counsel will have an opportunity to review the findings of the hearing officer and its decision and make its own decision based on its review at that time.So I just want to make sure that's clear regarding the business and the amounts that have been expended and all and and the councilman's point about, you know, how would you get this situation? I don't want to get into the specifics of that because I think it does go to the merits of the matter that is beingappealed by the business.Thank you. Okay. So we've heard from city staff the recommendations in front of us is to begin the process by sending it to the hearing officer. Whatever that decision is, can be appealed back to the city council. So there's still due process here.My I encourage the operator through this process, be a good neighbor, build goodwill, get in front of the community and help build support to help make your case here. Because I think there's a lot to be said about investment here, but quality of life is incredibly important.Members, please cast your vote.Motion is carried.Nine zero.

Councilmember O'Brien.Okay. So I'm going to go ahead and speak to this item in the next agenda. Item two. The first is a clerk file and the second will be a council bill. This is a fairly unique circumstance because we don't see subdivisions of this sort in the city very often.So I'm just going to walk through for the public exactly what's happening. We're considering a final plat approval for a subdivision located at 1756 Valentine Place South in the North Rainier Urban Village. This is a block west of Rainier Avenue South.The subdivision of this site will facilitate the sale of nine new single family homes and four townhomes. There are essentially three steps on how this process happens. The first is when someone wants to be considered for a subdivision.The Department of Planning Development is not another city and county departments. They're going to provide services to that review a preliminary plat and then DPD Macon makes a recommendation to the hearing examiner. The next thing is that the hearing examiner holds an open public record, a hearing to review the primary plat and then issues a decision consistentwith state law. That decision of the hearing examiner then constitutes authorization to develop the improvements shown on the preliminary plat. The final step is the verification after those improvements have been made as the DPD and Council review the final plat to determine whether the improvements made were consistent with the preliminary plat and any conditions opposed by thehearing examiner.Have been upheld.At this time, DPD start and central staff have reviewed the final plat and determined that the improvements are consistent with the primary plat. And so I will urge the council will put the clerk file on file and approve the subsequent Council bill.Thank you. Is there a second to his motion? Good. It's moved in, seconded that the clerk file be placed on file. Are there any further comments? Councilmember Rasmus question for Councilmember Brian.I reviewed the materials in the file. It wasn't clear who the petitioner is. Is this a nonprofit agency that is providing housing for affordable housing? Is it Seattle Housing Authority? Who is the petitioner and what type of housing will be provided?The applicant is Tony. Tony Wong I. My understanding is they're selling the parcels, but I don't know specifically what will be built on them. Right. That was unclear.From the materials. So. Any other questions or comments? Those in favor of placing the Clark file on file, please vote i. I. There was oppose vote no. The motion is unanimously approved and the file is filed.

And then that'll be followed by our finance director giving the finance department report. John GROSS So, Mr. Slinger.You're up. Thank you. Good afternoon. Mayor Garcia and members of the city council. I'm John Slinger, chief executive of the harbor department. Pleased to be here. And with me is Steve Rubin, who is our head of finance and administration, as well as Noelle Hasegawa, who runs our trade and communications organization.I'd also like to introduce Samira Ashley, who.Serves on.Our. Government Relations group. Thank you very much for the opportunity to present the Harvard Department's fiscal year 2015 budget. We are proposing a budget of nearly $858,000,000 million for the coming year. Our proposed spending plan is down about 16% from last year's budget, and this is largely due to the pace of our capital spending, which has slowedslightly from the pace of last year's record capital program. Still, the proposed budget is among our biggest ever. Approximately two thirds of the budget is comprised of capital improvement programs. And to remain competitive, the Port of Long Beach needs to continually reinvest in major facility upgrades.Our capital program leads the U.S. port industry totaling more than $4 billion this decade alone. In the process, we're creating thousands of much needed jobs in Long Beach and throughout Southern California. This is a summary of how we spend or how we plan to fund our fiscal 2015 expenditures.There's five categories that I'm going to be going through in detail, slide by slide. The largest source of funding is our operating revenue, which comes from the leases and fees we charge for use of our facilities. We expect our operating revenues to remain on par with what we forecast for this year.Vessel operators are still struggling to rebound from the 28 recession. And this is especially true with the container cargo business that accounts for the majority of our revenue. Several major shipping lines are forming new alliances that could move calls from one port to another.These evolving conditions create both market uncertainty and potential opportunity for the harbor department. Based on these unknowns, however, we've made a very conservative forecast projecting flat revenue growth for fiscal 2015. Our second largest source of funding is NONOPERATING revenues.These are generally grants from state and federal agencies, and in the coming year, the largest grants will be for the ongoing construction of a replacement for the Gerald Desmond Bridge. Of the projected $1.3 billion total cost of the bridge project approx.Approximately 800 million will come from grants in the near future. We'll be hosting an event to celebrate the next major milestone of the bridge project, the construction of the foundation upon which the bridge will stand. It's going to be a very exciting event to host.Other remaining sources of funds. 53 million will come from the state. I'm sorry, from the sale of the last of the port own gantry trains. And with this transaction, all of the ship to shore cranes will be owned by our terminal operators throughout the port.In addition to help pay for our capital programs. We're planning to borrow $115 million through revenue bonds. Given our financial strength, we have maintained a Double-A credit rating, which is among the highest for U.S. ports. This comes from a disciplined approach to managing our finances.For example, we maintain more than 600 days of operating cash on hand at all times. We also maintain a minimum of a 2 to 1 revenue to debt ratio, which exceeds 1.25 to 1 ratio required by our bondholders.The final funding source of 52 million will come from our existing port fund balances. Now let me shift to our expenditures. Personnel services represent our staffing expenses. Non personnel is for our operations, interdepartmental charges, new equipment and the cash transfer to the Tidelands Fund.Then there's the repayment of our debt, followed by our largest cash outlay, our capital investments. I'll discuss each of these categories in detail as we go forward. But as you can see, we're spending about 16% less in total than last year, primarily due to reduced capital spending.And again, our capital outlay is far and away the biggest share of our budget, about two thirds of our total spending. This capital budget represents our ongoing commitment to investing in the future of our harbor department and the economic development of our city and the region.Currently, these projects support thousands of construction jobs, including employment for several hundred Long Beach residents. Regarding the Desmond Bridge replacement project this year. We've cleared the path for construction and now we commenced actual construction of the bridge bridge foundations.So we're very, very exciting that the bridge is actually starting to take shape. At Little Harbor. Some of the world's biggest and most technically advanced cranes are now being installed and tested. Phase one of this key project will go live next year in 2015.This project is creating the world's greenest terminal operation and is doubling its capacity and cutting emissions.By more than half.Among our other environmental projects are more shore power, plug in berths and community grants for air quality related improvements. Also in the coming year, we're taking delivery of two new fire boats, which are much bigger and more powerful to deal with today's largest ships being built.We're increasing our personnel services spending to satisfy step increases in negotiated salary increases. In addition, we're adding positions to support additional construction activity. We continue to expand our engineering staff with 20 more positions, and one of our key objectives is to reduce dependency on outside consultants to ensure that core knowledge is transferred to and retained by ourteam. We're also creating an in-house construction and maintenance dove team to reduce construction, construction and contracting costs. And we're adding security staff in large part to help with the traffic that has been been increasing around many of our construction sites.Our operating expenses. Are increasing to accommodate critical projects. Most of the spending is for maintenance of roads and utilities, but these costs also include $1.5 million to support the testing of a clean air barge under development as the alternative maritime maritime emissions control system.This this system. Hooks up to the exhaust stack of a ship which captures the exhaust, then cleans the emissions and effectively produces a near zero emission operation. If approved by state regulators, these barges could be deployed in the very near future, providing another way for us to eliminate emissions from vessels of birth and those vessels that otherwisecan't have electrical ship to shore capabilities. We're also spending $1.8 million on the development of a hybrid electric truck system that will operate with overhead electric wires, which will allow zero emission truck operations within the port. And we're planning to spend nearly 1 million to support Long Beach's signature civic events, such as the Grand Prix, the municipalband, many festivals, parades, educational programs and other activities that make this city a true community. Our inter-departmental changes or charges, I'm sorry, are increasing by nearly 18%, largely reflecting the Harbor Department's share of various city operations. This includes the cost of a new city financial and information system.It also includes police services, which are up 3%, reflecting a recent reorganization, as well as fire services, which are up substantially to support the operations of the two new fire boats also are transferred to the Tidelands Tidelands Fund, which supports Beach and Marina projects, is estimated to be about $17 million and and it may be adjusted toreflect.Actual year end revenues.In summary, our proposed spending plan for the coming year is very robust, one of our biggest budgets ever. Because of the evolving alliances and competition among vessel operators, we're forecasting flat growth in operating revenues. But to gain a competitive edge.We're moving ahead with a very aggressive capital program, although a smaller investment than last year. We are proposing to add 28 positions in total, mainly in engineering and security, to support ongoing capital projects. Our spending continues to improve, and greenport operations in creating thousands of much needed jobs and economic activity in this region are really the focusof this budget. Finally, we are proud that the Port of Long Beach remains financially strong and we continue to work on making the port even stronger. That concludes my presentation and I will look forward to answering questions at the appropriate time.Thank you, Mr. Schlanger. Up. And now we're going to be moving on to financial management, and then we'll come back for questions.Director John GROSS.Thank you for them for the opportunity, mayor and Council members to present information about the Department of Financial Management. Many of the functions of this department are behind the scenes, but the functions are critical to the provision of services to our citizens.The title of the department describes many of its functions financial management the department helps plan for and helps set policy for how money will be both used and how it will be saved. Department tracks money in the department accounts for it.The department is also involved in identifying sources of money and in collecting money, and it has major roles in defining and implementing controls to make sure the money is properly managed and spent. Financial management also directs a number of important functions that are outside of traditional financial areas.And I'm going to talk about a number of core services that the department provides. Accounting, financial reporting, accounts payable, call bill paying and payroll or traditional finance areas. We have complex accounting requirements in the city. We're not only large, we also have unusual complexities due to our enterprise in grant operations.Payroll is also very complex because we have employees who work 24 hour shifts, over 500 types of pay, and about a hundred different types of payroll deductions. Financial planning and budget development and management are the flashiest part of the department and they are very important.Developing a good financial plan, having a financially sound budget and good budget management are all keys to long term provision of quality services for our citizens. Long Beach has over $1.5 billion in investments outstanding at any time and a $2.3 billion in outstanding debt issues.These are large portfolios for any city. The existing debt portfolio is complex and require significant ongoing management. But on top of managing the current portfolio, we are almost always working on at least one new debt issue or major financing issue.In addition, financial management not only makes many of the city's purchases, it monitors compliance with city requirements, as well as encouraging local businesses, minority and small businesses to participate in the city purchasing. The department registers businesses after ensuring that they have the necessary approvals and it collects the associated business licensing tax.Financial management also manages the entertainment process in the city, including hearings, review and revocations, financial management bills, and collects all utility bills, all parking citations, ambulance bills. We also handle delinquent bill collections. Financial management plays a role in the city's financial controls, in financial emergency preparedness, and in designing and maintaining the operations of the city's financial systems. Customer service is very important to us in this whole realm, whether we have internal customers or customers that are residents, businesses or visitors outside of the normal financial area. The department is responsible for fleet acquisitions, fleet maintenance and towing and line sales.With fleet operations part of the financial management department, there is substantial emphasis on financial aspects of these operations and a high degree of emphasis on customer service due to the department's inherent emphasis on customers and its independence from any department that uses fleet services.We have a number of accomplishments. I wanted to mention at least a few. Our annual financial report has received a national award for a number of years. This award by the Government Finance Officers Association is a nice recognition of quality accounting and reporting.Financial management has recently implemented the decentralization of accounts payable. Again, that's our bill paying process that decentralization improves controls and oversight improves efficiency, improves relations with vendors, and helps prepare for our new financial system. That part went through the Budget Office.It's constantly looking at revenues and revenue sources, both to project the amount we will receive and to identify revenue areas that may need to be addressed. However, in general, maximizing revenues is a massive undertaking and impacted by many factors.Our debt issuance function has done very well. We not only provide the city with financing for projects that may need complex finance funding, but we have saved millions of dollars in interest costs by finding ways for the city to take advantage of low interest rates on previously issued debt.The city also has a very good credit rating, an AA rating from the Fitch rating agency and similar ratings from other agencies. This is a testament to both the city's good practices and more importantly, an indication, as stated by the rating agencies themselves of good financial management decisions by the City Council.Over the years, the consistent, ongoing and successful installation of new major systems is another accomplishment, but it is also a source of some concern because of the major diversion that these system, major diversion of staff that these system implementations cause.The systems implemented or being implemented include utility billing, business licensing, parking, citation processing, fleet management systems, debt management and the citywide financial H.R. Systems. Whoops. Going in the wrong direction. In terms of our budget summary, the budget is $65 million, 241 full time equivalent positions, but two thirds of that budget and almost half staff are for fleetand towing operations. These operations charge for the services and the costs are reimbursed. The total general fund budget on the financial side is about $8 million. Budgeted costs for the department are higher than that, but other funds reimburse the general fund for services provided.Most of the significant changes in the department's budget are in fleet services. Spending for the city's fleet vehicles has been unusually low for the last few years. This year we are proposing an increase of 4.1 million to restore annual purchases to a normal level.To begin to keep the city's fleet reliable and cost effective. To maintain the funding comes from dedicated from a dedicated fleet acquisition account, not the general fund. The age of the fleet and repair costs have significantly increased over the last few years.This year we expect to replace 160 to 200 vehicles with this funding, including police patrol vehicles. In other words, our black and whites street sweepers refuse trucks and utility trucks. This is out of a fleet of about 1900 vehicles.The actual vehicles to be replaced will be identified based on a study now underway that will determine what vehicles to replace. And that determination will be what minimizes the city's overall cost with respect to those vehicles. We're also proposing some maintenance work on the Temple and Willow Fleet facilities building.This building has not had significant major maintenance since it was built about 15 years ago. The pros work on the heating system. Roof repairs and exterior painting and ceiling will help preserve the facility. Jeep's, more known as telematics in the fleet industry, will be put on all vehicles where there is benefit to the city.GPS systems have tremendously improved in capability and provide both real time and passive monitoring of the vehicle's health and driver and vehicle behavior. This is a best practices, best business practice and includes real time reporting of vehicle malfunctions, excessive idling vehicle location and poor and unsafe driving behavior.We're going to have about 1500 vehicles so equipped when we're done. Terms of significant issues and opportunities. We have a few big one being the new Financial Human Resources System project. It's a huge but necessary undertaking. The project will bring modern capabilities to our management systems and end the serious risk of major system problems in the future. This type of citywide system replacement is the single biggest computer project a city can undertake. These huge private projects can be problematic. It is the goal of this project to avoid major problems. Staff assigned to the project will need to be immersed in the implementation of the new systems to understand them at the most detailed level.And they will need to know the city's detailed processes and procedures to be able to design how the new systems will be configured and programed. In addition, many of the city's financial and human resources, processes and policies will need to be redesigned either because they are antiquated already or because they do not work efficiently, or sometimes evenat all. With new systems, key staff will need to be dedicated to the project for an extended period of time. The impact will be felt most strongly beginning next year and for at least a year after that. While the goal of the project will be to minimize the impact as much as possible, the project will need tobe a top priority for finance, human resources and the Technology Services Department. The Civic Center, if City Council chooses to move forward, is an extraordinarily complex financial transaction. It will also require a major effort. Labor negotiations over the next year will also occur and require substantial effort.As I previously mentioned, we're making changes in the way we determine which vehicles to replace and when we are conducting a study to improve our approach to vehicle replacements, not replacing vehicles too soon or too late, but rather at the point that minimizes total cost.At the same time, we are constantly working to make the fleet greener. Whether it is through the use of alternative fuels, fleet reduction or reducing the size of vehicles themselves to get better mileage. And I guess in conclusion, the department in all its operations, including Fleet, Fleet and Towing, has many dedicated employees.These are people who put a lot of effort into their jobs and have a desire to do a good job for the city and improve the city for its residents and businesses. Other departments, including the city auditor, have also had a substantial role in financial management and control and in budget development and management.They are all part of the citywide team that provides these financial services to the city and I very much want to express my appreciation for the work and dedication of the financial management employees and the employees throughout the city who work in similar functions.That concludes my presentation.Q We're going to begin with council questions and Mr. Off with Councilmember Price.Thank you. Mr. GROSS, first of all, thank you for all the work that you do for the city and all the insight that you give us on our budget. As we move ahead, I really appreciate it. I wanted to talk with you specifically about the $4.1 million, roughly $4.1 million one time adjustment for the Fleet Acquisition Fund. You mentioned that that money is coming from a Fleet acquisition fund, not the general fund. Is that correct?That is correct.And so does that mean that that $4.1 million is earmarked specifically and limited to use of fleet acquisition?Yes, it is. In one more comment. It really probably isn't one time. The the the Fleet Fund has had a ignore abnormally low expenditures last year. It would probably normally be our recommendation to spend around the amount you're seeing in this FY15 budget.We are very far behind. That is really just a normal level.And the Fleet Acquisition Fund, how is that fund created?The fleet acquisitions operation looks at each vehicle, identifies how long its that vehicle lasts and then charges let's say it lasts for five years. I'm simplifying things. That would be the case of a police vehicle. The police department has just basically charged one fifth of that cost each year so that in the fifth year the money hasbeen accumulated. That's done for each department on a vehicle by vehicle basis.Thank you.Was that it comes from reprice or. Okay.Thank you. That's.Thank you, Councilmember Austin.Thank you very much. I just had a couple of questions. And first, I want to thank Mr. Slater up and Mr. GROSS for for their great reports. In last year's budget, a new bureau was actually created in financial management called financial controls.And Mr. GROSS, can you describe what this what role this bureau is currently providing for your department? Yes, this is a small bureau, has three FTE that is intended to generally improve financial controls and management in the city.Our financial controls and processes are not as good as they should be. That's something that became evident when I came to the city. The causes include antiquated financial systems in there and in the cities, and it's many. It's really a good thing, but it's a relentless focus on productivity and services to residents and cost cutting.Those are very good things. But what often happens in an organization is when you do that, you are unintentionally weakened controls. That has happened here and it's happened in innumerable other governments and organizations whenever budget cost cutting and efficiency improvements occur.So this this bureau is intended to help improve controls throughout the city. There are two specific areas that that we're going to be focusing on. The new financial systems, which will be a major effort and a major opportunity to improve controls.They will be this group will be focused on that next year and also on financial controls and processes in emergency situations. This is what happens in the event of an earthquake or something similar to that. That's an area in which our financial controls and processes really badly need work.So those are two areas of emphasis. Sometimes it's asked of me, Well, how is that operation different from our city auditor? And I describe it as a symbiotic relationship. They work in synergy. The Financial Controls Bureau does not do audits.The city auditor does audits. On the other hand, the city auditor does not develop financial controls and processes. And this financial control bureau, that is its primary function. So they work together to try to improve financial controls and management in the city.So let me answer your question. Yeah, that you quite you did. And I thank you for for going into detail. And this is the first time that I actually heard that we there was a symbiotic relationship between that bureau and the city auditor's office.So so thank you. So you you forecast that being a long term bureau or D, do you see yourself in the next couple of years reorganizing in any way? That's a good question. I think in the next I don't think in the next couple of years its focus will be on our financial system and the emergency financialcontrol procedures. Those are the areas that most badly need the work on the financial systems because we're putting in brand new systems and this is the way, best and fastest way to improve controls. And as I said before, our emergency procedures badly need work.The Bureau will not go away. The need for improving controls and revising them is a pretty big task. What will happen, and I think what you're referring to is what it works on will change somewhat. They will move to different emphases.As time moves on, we get something improved. We will move to change it so that the effort, what they will work on specifically will change. The overall goals will not. Okay, I guess it sounds like it's working. I also noticed that the projected revenues from the business licenses is down from f y 13 and you're actually projectinglower revenues in FY 15. Do you have any explanations as to why we're experiencing such a downward trend in that that area revenues? We're not really expecting a downward trend in business revenues. I think what is happening is that we're doing extremely well this year and and that we're not necessarily suggesting that it's going to be that. Well, it could be. It could be as well next year. But there's been a change in the we don't expect a decrease. And then my last question, I guess, would be for the city manager, because it's just been something that has been bugging me.I notice that Fleet Services is under financial management. Can you explain why organizationally that is the case?Councilmember Fleet Services is in financial management in many organizations. It's also in public works. It recently was in public works. We basically took it took fleet services out of public works. Public purse was growing so much and wanted to have a little bit more control in operation.So we put it to finance under Mr. GROSS. We also have a brand new fleet manager, Mr. Dan Berlin, who's with us tonight as well. And he works in finance managing this Fleet Department.Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember Richardson.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And Mr. GROSS, thank you so much for that riveting presentation. I know I only have questions for Mr. Slager up. But I thank you for the presentation. Mr. Slinger up first of all, your PowerPoint was much more colorful, colorful than the others.And and so whatever you're doing, keep it up, because I was able to so pay attention to read the whole thing. I just want to I just wanted to chime in on one slide in particular, operating expenses. I noticed a couple of things, the clean air barges and and I know that's a program that that is it'snew technology and it's taken us in the direction to have a zero emissions port. Can you expand on that? My question is, when can when, by your estimation, if we keep heading down this direction, investing, making investments like this, how soon can we say we'll have a zero emissions port as it relates to providing options for everysingle container ship that that comes in the Amex's?Service in the Amex.System.Is being tested and.Demonstrated as part of its commissioning and approval process. In other words, the the various regulators and in the city have to approve. I mean, in the state have to prove the viability of the system.An actual demonstration is occurring tomorrow morning, which is one of the final demonstrations that we're going to see before certification takes place.And once certification does take place.Then the the next effort is, of course, is going to be to purchase and and and build and then deploy numerous of these image systems across the port. Now, what it does specifically.Is that the technology itself and.This is this is a company that's been working on this for many, many years. But the technology itself in isolation is not new. These are known technologies. The what's what's been done that's.Unique is the integration of these various technologies into one.Comprehensive system that basically.Takes exhausts from diesel engines.And scrubs all of the bad pollutants out of it, basically delivering an inert exhaust.Free of things like NOx and Sox and all the bad things we want to eliminate out of emissions. It's like a gigantic catalytic converter on a car, rendering it very, very clean. In this case, more than half of the.Ships that visit the port do not have the the means to electrify their vessels and take advantage of of ship to shore electrical connections.And that's because these ships are infrequent.Visitors, but work or contracted by shippers, and therefore they have not.Or will not make the investment necessary to ship electrical plug in with this system with a assuming it's going to be certified. And we have.High.Confidence it will it will, in fact, change the the entire nature of our green program, because 100% of our ships at berth, as well as those that are being anchored offshore, could, in fact be subject to this type of technology.And therefore, we would have a dramatic impact on emissions profile for the port. And it's part of our objective for attaining the Air Resources Board.Standards for the next generation of clean emissions, and that's in 2023.So we've achieved all of this. We've achieved the 2014 attainment, and we're our eye now is on the 2023 attainment. So these are the types of technologies we're going to employ to do that very thing.I just want to applaud you in and just point out that it's really special that we in the near future will be able to see 100% of the ships that come and dock with us to take care of it, manage all of their emissions.I think that's impressive. And, and and I want to see that in future budgets, you continue to make these investments and to boards now and the community outreach you folks do a great job your team here and your your report does a great job with supporting the community festivals and things like that.I specifically want to call out the educational programs you guys have with your scholarships. Many folks might not know that you have a great scholarship program. That's something I'd like to see you expand in the future. Thank you.Thank you.Any other questions? Seeing them there. I mean. Any other council questions? Let me just say first also to our two presentations tonight, and I know this concludes all of our our presentations from our departments and that have come forward.So thank you all. You all done a great job of presenting and putting together a great budget and budget presentations. And so, Patt, also make sure you communicate to your staff that we're appreciative of all these discussions and a lot of exciting stuff happening across across the city department.So thank you for that. And with that, I'm going to turn this going back to I think Vice Mayor Lowenthal is going to make a few comments and then I'm going to open it up for public comment and then we'll begin some of the budget resolutions.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I wanted to go ahead and thank staff for their presentations and also really the finance staff for all the homework that they've done to support the BRC in their deliberation and consideration of these items.On on hearing item one. If we could take up council members the initial items, 1.1 to 1.9. These are administrative budget items, which also include the budget for harbor and and the water department. And if we can go ahead and take up the motion to adopt fiscal year 15 budget items 1.1 through 1.9.I want to make sure also, Mr. Schilling, I mean, I need to do public comment as well, so.That's correct. And if we could take the items. Individual, individual, please.Thank you. Absolutely. I appreciate that. We can do that.Vice Mayor. What I'm going to do is I'm going to go to public comment, but did you want to make a few more comments in the public comment?I do. So we'll go ahead and take them individually after our comments. So the Budget Oversight Committee has met a few times in the start of this budget process, and I wanted to thank all the members of the community that's come out to speak on these items.We've heard community priorities from public safety, which is always a community priority. We've heard priorities for park rangers, we've heard priorities for language access. And earlier in the Budget Oversight Committee, the recommendation was to receive and file the staff recommendation for language access, which I believe amounts to just over $149,000.However, in further consideration, I will be making an amended motion and hoping to receive support to find an additional $100,000 for language access. In order to bring that up to a rough estimate of about $250,000, I just wanted to provide that caveat because I know just about an hour and a half ago, we left the meeting witha different with a different motion, and that is the box motion. But we will make it in an amended motion here and hope to receive support from the Council on the Park Rangers item. I do believe each council member supports the concept of greater security at parks, but when we consider what council members have have spoken toand supported, we we would like to support greater security through our police department. Our police department does a phenomenal job here in the city of Long Beach. And what we would like to do is ensure that the parks are really considered as part of their their territory as well to provide greater public safety for our residents andour visitors. The Parks Department director has provided us an update on his park security program, the pilot program, we we believe, through Budget Oversight Committee, and will make this recommendation, certainly to give that program an opportunity to be successful, to launch initially and then be successful.And we'll also make a recommendation to shift the cost center of the park rangers to police so that they are reporting to police as opposed to a non sworn director of Parks Recreation Marine, which he's a fabulous director, but we don't know that park rangers should be reporting to them.And so our recommendation is not to expand the park ranger program, but it will be at the time that we make the recommendation, certainly will be to ensure that the cost center of our existing park rangers get shifted to police and that we would support the Director of Parks, Recreation and Marine in his proposal for the pilotsecurity program. And those are the comments I have for right now, Mr. Mayor, and I'll wait for the remainder comments when we make the motions.Okay. So what we do now is open up for public comment on on the budget and then we will begin going through all the different I believe there's a total of 16 resolutions that we have to go through tonight.So public comment, please come forward if there's a comment. Okay. See, see? No public comment.You can do that through the circles of the. Oh, I'm sorry. I just. I know.Sorry about.That. No problem. It's okay.Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Members of the Council. My name is Renee Castro, and I live at 6.6 Grand Avenue in the third district. I just want to start by thanking Councilmember or Vice Mayor Susilo at all who contributed another $100,000 to the language access policy.I mean, that's incredible. It's it's an incredible sign. There's been a lot of community engagement on this. We've been doing large visits with you, Mr. Mayor, members of the council. It's it's been an incredible discussion. I really also want to appreciate staff's work on this.I do, though, along with the coalition, really want to emphasize that, you know, to fund the full policy, again, is 360,000. There would be 150 plus the 209,000. I feel like the full policy is 1.2 million, as you all know.And, you know, we continue to talk about costs. But, I mean, there's there's really efficiencies that we could create when we focus on greater language access and democratic engagement. And I'm not smart enough to do those to do that kind of analysis.But, you know, hopefully at some point we can continue to talk about efficiencies. I think this is just a really unique opportunity for the council. And you, Mr. Mayor, in your in your first term, what I hope is your first term, you know, to really demonstrate some bold leadership.I realize it's it's a tough ask right now, especially for one time funds. But again, we really plead with the council and you, Mr. Mayor, to thank you so much. A couple of weeks ago, you lifted the cap and you said, I think this is reasonable.$360,000 to support people who are monolingual like yourself. Mr. Mayor, growing up in this city, I think I think is a is a reasonable investment. And I thank you so much for your leadership. I think this is a great start.But tonight, again, we're hoping that the council supports us with the full 360,000. Thank you so much.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Hello. My name's Madison with the Long Beach Immigrant Rights Coalition and the Language Access Coalition. And just to add to what our partner Vinny said, while we appreciate the potential over 100,000 added to the already 150 allocated, we do want to reiterate why this additional money of 10 to 210000 is important.There have been some issues raised at the B or C, but we would like to address the importance of, again, the translation of documents that 30,000 documents translated into garlic for documents that already exist in Spanish for an additional 7000 automated voice mails in languages in three languages at 1000 907,000, the translation of 25 most commonly usedweb pages. The training of staff acting as interpreters at 56,000. The notice of policy for the use of outreach for the community at 13 K. And then the use of a citywide language learning not just public works at 50 K.So again, while we appreciate the work that has been done. We do feel it's important to fully implement this policy at the 210,000 key that we ask for to have a real meaningful startup up for our community. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Good evening. My name's Laura Merrifield.I'm with Building Healthy Communities Long Beach. I wanted to I wanted to say that if it feels like there's a lot of numbers that have been going around, it's because there are a lot of different numbers that are going around.And part of that is the hard work, right, both on our staff side, on us as advocates looking at these different reports. And so, you know, I know it's been just a lot that's been floating around. And just one thing I did want to just reiterate is that the last week council directed staff to look at somethingbeyond, you know, to look at additional funding without a cap. And so I really appreciate the additional 100,000 suggested. And that brings us very close to what we've been asking for, which is, as Rene said, you know, about 360,000 in total.So we're really only asking now 100, 110 above those basic recommendations. And, you know, it's taken us a long time to get here and those numbers keep moving. But we know that the more resources we have, we can really fund this policy.You know, we're asking for additional telephonic lines, not just I believe it'd be about 67 covered under these new recommendations. We want to make sure that, you know, we have 25 Web pages, not just ten. We want to do this in full and not just our as full as we can with the resources we have.Council Member Mungo earlier mentioned a potential 311 line to direct phone calls, which we think is a great idea. But again, that phone line only is as useful as the language access behind it once people are referred. And so we just want to be very clear, you know, that we're here.We're going to we really we feel like we've made some compromises, but we're here to ask for full funding at 360,000 and to consider that funding from these one time oil revenues and other sources. Thank you.Thank you so much. Next speaker, please.Good evening. My name is Jonathan McGregor.I live at nine four Redondo Avenue, and I'm here with Alex in Long Beach. First, we want to thank you, Mayor Garcia, for a meeting with those earlier today.We are hopeful. City Council follows your lead.And addresses their concerns.Remain hopeful that we will be able to.Work together to find meaningful and comprehensive solutions to the housing crisis here in Long Beach. At the same.Time, this budget process has been a frustrating.One for community members who have come in support.Of affordable housing and the use of and funds housing. Long Beach Staff Board and resident leaders.Have attended every public budget meeting to date and have received no recognition.Or support from the City Council regarding their concerns. A basic tenet of healthy democracy is open dialog between the people and their leaders when they go out to talk to my neighbors and friends to encourage them to engage in the local democratic process.Time after time I hear from them.That is a waste of time and why.Vote when nothing changes? But I still go out and we still attend these meetings and stay late. Stay late to express their concerns, because we believe that the only way to find meaningful solutions is by working together. We house in Long Beach and the residents who make up our community base.Understand that the budgets are difficult and that they're allocating. The property tax.Revenues to housing can be a.Politically challenging task. However, for the past weeks we have felt ignored and began.To understand why people must feel discouraged to share their concerns at city council meetings. See, it is not simply the lack of support on this issue, but the silence. The silence from.You.Earlier. That concerns us. The silence and lack of support is not something we expect. It's something we expect from a city council members. Your obligation as city council members is to address residents and their concerns. We share this because we still very much desire to have a healthy working relationship with you.Beyond government. There will be many opportunities that we will have to work together to increase affordable housing and improve the stock of existing housing. Healthy working relationships are building respect and communication, and our desire from here on out is to build this with you.We do this work because we know that housing has a significant impact on the wellbeing of self, in the experiences of families across our city struggling to provide for their families and have a healthy life.If we make housing a priority, we can work together to alleviate the housing crisis in our city. Thank you so much. And we look forward to working with all of you.Thank you. Won't you hold up right there one sec. I wanted to say something to you guys real quick, so I know that you guys have been here for for many weeks and others that are that are in the audience as well.And I appreciate the meeting that I had today and that we've had continuously. So what I just want to say to all of you is I'm fairly certain in my conversations with other members of this council that everyone understands that affordable housing and the discussion around it is important and that we're going to have.And so what I would say is I know that even though we've been in office for a short amount of time or most of us, you've all been advocating for a very long time, longer than most of us have been on the council.And so I understand that frustration. But I will say that we think collectively and I speak, I think, for for for the council. And if not, a people can chime in. We understand there's a there's a need. And over the next few months, I personally plan to engage on discussions.I know others will as well. There's a lot of opportunity at the state level, next year's budget discussions that we're going to have about this issue. And the issue is much broader than $2.5 million, $2.5 million is going to build this.How many units? A handful of new units. The the issue is a much larger issue if we're really going to look at building significant amounts of affordable housing at all levels, low income workforce, we've talked about teacher housing, all the other things that are out there that's going to take a lot of heavy lifting from from allof you, but also from us. And I think I think we have we hear that this is a budget that is being implemented not just by us, but being recommended also by by a former body. And so I think that I'll just say we're doing the best we can with what we have.But I think this is this discussion is going to be elevated. And so you have my commitment. I'm not I don't I haven't been announcing, you know, initiatives or things that are important just to throw them out there.But they are going to be discussed in a meaningful way. And I think at the end of the next year, you're going to see significant progress in the discussion. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Any other public comment?Okay. So I'm going to go ahead and turn this back over to Councilmember Price.I apologize. I hit that. Oh.Okay. Councilmember Gonzalez.I just wanted to I just wanted to say thank you to the housing advocates. I know you guys have worked so hard. And like the mayor said, you know, we we certainly all agree that, you know, this is certainly important.And I know that our office has been working with other organizations like Habitat for Humanity in obtaining, you know, affordable housing. So this is still going to continue on our radar. It's one of our priorities, the fact that it's not the amount, you know, that we we can we can do now.Does it mean that it's fallen off the radar? So I also assure you that will be committed to this as well.Okay. And with that, I'm going to go and turn this over to two to walk us through some of the items and trips over to the bossy chair to go over the budget resolution items.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I, too, want to thank the Housing Coalition for their advocacy and firmly believe in what the mayor is saying about us having a larger conversation, a citywide conversation about the need for housing. And I'm thankful that you mentioned that tonight and made that commitment on our behalf.I do appreciate that. Mr. City Attorney, you'd like to see us go through items 1.1 through 1.9 individually, correct?That is correct.Okay. So council members, if. If I may, item 1.1, I move to recommend to adopt resolution approving the fiscal year 15 budget for the Long Beach Harbor Department as adopted by the Board of Harbor Commissioners on July 14, 2014.\nSummary:", "answer": "WITHDRAWN\r\nRecommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record, conclude the public hearing and take the actions necessary to adopt the Fiscal Year 2015 budget as listed in Attachment A.  (Citywide)"}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nGreat. Thank you. Next item.Item number 13 report from Financial Management Recommendation to receive a report on the strategy five year capital plan and prioritization criteria for the Tidelands Capital City Wide.Thank you. Before I turn this over, I just want to say that there has been a lot of conversation, obviously, about our Tidelands Fund and the challenges we're having with oil, the production of oil, the cost that we are evaluating our our price of oil, and both the Highlands and the Uplands Oil Fund.I wanted to just take a quick moment and thank the city staff. You guys have done a great job up to this point for giving us a report and especially point out Councilwoman Price and Council and Vice Mayor Lowenthal, who have been all over this issue.And so I'm sure we'll hear from them tonight. So I'll turn this over to staff.Mayor, council members. Obviously, we have been paying a lot of attention to the oil industry and the price of oil during the past six months as it affects our budget both operationally and capital project wise. So tonight, we're gonna give you a quick update on where we're at.Does it or does it not affect us in the current fiscal year? What premises will we have to accept as we go forward in next fiscal year as we put together the budget? Our finance director, John GROSS, is going to talk more about the operating side.And then our assistant city manager, Tom Modica, is going to talk about the capital side. So with that, I'll turn it over to Mr. GROSS.Thank you very much. City Manager West, we're going to be talking as as the manager said about the strategy for the decline in the price of oil and how it impacts our main funds, primarily the Titans fund. But we're also going to talk about the Uplands Oil Fund.This is essentially going to parallel the memo that was that you got on December 31st, and it's included in your packet with some updates based on the most recent information that we have. Once I figure out how to.Get this.Slide to move forward, the you're going to hear about a background on oil prices, an update on the Uplands Fund and the general fund, an update on the Tidelands operating budget, the impact on the Tidelands capital budget and the five year plan.And then Assistant City Manager Modica will be talking about the impact on the capital projects, the updated strategy for Tidelands Capital Project and the five year plan and then next steps. Let's say you're allowed to do that. The oil was at about $100 a barrel for the last three years.There was no problem until about August of this year after the budget had been developed for oil price began declining. At that time, it looked like it was a pretty normal oscillation. But oil has continued to decline, and it's currently about $40 a barrel.Actually, today it's about 45, but it continues to oscillate subsequent to that decline. It's been pretty well determined that the price decline was caused by basic economics, that the supply of oil simply exceeds the demand at present. This is a chart that shows the history of the price of oil over the last eight years.It does oscillate, but in particular it jumped up and to that in 2008 and dropped in 2009. And then from about January 2011 to now, it's been at about $100 a barrel. It was at $100 a barrel when the price was when the budget was developed this year.And then it started its decline, as you see on the chart. So what is the impact of of these price declines on the budgets of the city? Well, the operating budgets of the city assume oil is at $70 a barrel.The titans capital plan assumes oil is at $100 a barrel. Those are the prices that are used when the budget is developed. We use $70 a barrel for the operating budget so that there is leeway. If the price of oil drops in this case, it could drop by more than 30%.We would still be okay with our operating budget if if the price of oil dropped no more than 30%. We've seen more than a 30% drop. The assumption of $100 for the Tidelands capital budget allowed for planning of important city council projects and how those projects would be allocated and when they would be done.If oil remained at what had been a relatively steady price for the last few years, so we used $70 to the operating budget and $100 for the capital budget in developing this year's budget. What has actually happened. Obviously, we're no longer at one.We looked at the market when we did this update at the end of November and felt that the best projection was that oil might be at $60 a barrel for FY 15 and 16 and maybe it would be at $70 for FY 17 through 19 for projection purposes.That projection is going to be just a starting point because any long term projection of oil is going to be problematic because the future price is unpredictable. That being said, there is no indication at present that oil is going to return to $100 any time soon.But it certainly could happen. It could continue to rise. It could fall at any time. The current oil price of Iran, $45 a barrel does require us to do an updated projection. The $60 and $70 projection that we just did no longer seems appropriate.We will be updating it in the first quarter of this year, the January through March period. On the next slide, I thought it was important to show what the commodities market and the people who speculate on the future who bet money on the price of oil, what are they saying in this chart?Shows what they have said at three different time periods. On the horizontal axis is years. This is a chart that represents 2014. Basically at the time the budget was adopted through 2020 and shows the prices that people are betting money on what the price of oil might be over the future.The top graph, which was as of June 30, 2014, when we did the budget, shows that in 2014 the price of oil people bet on the price of oil being $100 and the betting was then that it would drop it down to about $82 a barrel over the next five years through 2020.That was what the expectation was of the commodities market when we did the budget, $100 a barrel and dropping over time. The next graph, the line, the gray one is the price of oil in the commodities market over the years, over the future.On November 28th, the day we did this projection that you're seeing tonight, it said that the immediate price of oil would be around $60 a barrel and the betting was that it would rise to a little above $70 a barrel over the next five years.Today or as close today as we could get January 28th. The bottom curve says that the commodities market, oil market is betting that the price of oil will be in the area of $40 over the next few months and then rise slowly over the next five years to about $60 a barrel.That's the betting of the market, that of the commodities market. That by no means mean that that's what actually going to happen. It probably doesn't represent what is actually going to happen, but it is a guess by the people who actually bet on the market.So how does that information impact our revenues for our various two oil funds, uplands and Tidelands? As I mentioned, the Uplands oil fund revenue is budgeted at $70 per barrel by policy. Anything above $70 per barrel is budgeted the next year and used for one time expenditures.Uplands oil money has two sources. It isn't just from the sale of oil. That's about half the revenue. The other half of the revenue is actually a contractual fee assessed on production and exploration costs in the city's oil production area.That is as production and exploration goes up. The money in the uplands fund goes up also. So based on the current projection of $60 and $70 oil, we expect that the uplands oil revenues will be adversely impacted by several million dollars a year from both the lower price of oil and lower production costs.That is important because the uplands oil revenue supports the general fund and general fund operations. We transfer about $17 million a year to the general fund to support operations such as police and fire and parks and public works purposes.That's about 4.4% of the general fund. And we put that number in there to show that it's not 10%. It's not 15%. It's not that big of a number. But it's also not a small number like 1%. So it's significant, but not not an overly large percentage of the general fund.We are also suggesting by way of this projection that all the money will be needed for operations and there probably will not be any one time revenue that the city has had for the last several years. Coming from the Uplands Oil Fund, that one time money is typically used for capital purposes to support improvements throughout the city. We do need to update this projection. The projection is and was not very specific in November because the production costs were changing. We knew that whatever projection we had would be out of date before we even printed it.So we will be doing an updated projection in the first quarter of 2015, January through March. As an aside, we also expect that production of oil will decline somewhat in Long Beach and that will reduce revenue from an oil barrel tax.Probably not a huge amount of money. It generates about $600,000 a year, $6 million a year. So there'll be some reduction in that source also. So let's switch to the Titans fund entitlements, oil revenue first that revenue. Oil revenue is impacted by three factors the price of oil and the amount of oil produced.The price of oil times the amount of oil produced gives you a revenue, but that revenue is offset by the cost of production and exploration. Both production cost and investment in oil exploration are being reduced in Long Beach.This is happening throughout the country where many oil companies are scrambling to reduce their production and exploration costs. And the company in Long Beach is doing exactly the same. Those lower production costs and lower investment in oil exploration will somewhat temper the loss of revenue because even though will have lower revenue will also have lower costs.Also, the projections show that even if oil returned to $70, the revenue that's generated in this current market may be somewhat lower than the current $70 limit that we had. So some of these dollars in the future may not being quite as much revenue, at least in the immediate future, even when the price comes up.So let's talk about what the impact is on the Tidelands operating budget. The projection at the 60 and $70 level shows that all Tidelands revenues will be need. Oil revenues will be needed to support operations. Even with all the revenues going to operations and none to capital, that tidelands operations may still have a shortfall in the areaof 1 to $2 million in FY15, and deficits could exist in the future. Also, in fact, they're likely now we are doing an updated projection. You you've heard that oil is now in the 40, $45 a level, which is much lower than the 60 to $70 projection you're seeing here.But production costs will also be lower. So we're not sure what those numbers will say. And that's why we need a new projection. And we're working on that now. In the Tidelands Capital area. I mentioned before that all revenues will be needed to support operations, so there aren't going to be any new capital moneys available for theforeseeable future until revenues increase and oil prices increase. However, there is still a substantial amount of capital revenue available, even if there's no new money. We have a total of about $95 million available that can be used for capital.22 million of that is unassigned from unassigned funds available. Bottom line, money that hasn't been assigned yet and $73 million is available that has already been assigned by city council to existing projects. But these projects are either incomplete or not under construction and could be reassigned or could be used for the projects for which they were originallyintended. So $95 million estimated is available. We're still fine tuning that number. It could be a little different as we really fine tune the accounts that also be updated in the first quarter. At this time, I'm going to turn the presentation over to Assistant City Manager Modica, who will talk about the existing capital projects that haven't beenbuilt, what our strategy is and what our next steps are.Thank you, Mr. GROSS. Mr. Mayor, members of the council. As John mentioned, we do have significant resources available to us in cash, not a projection that's actual dollars. That's that $95 million that we have identified that can be reprogramed for funding.And so while that's a very large number, we also have approximately 232 million in projects that are budgeted or in the five year capital plan that are incomplete or that construction has not started. Those projects, it's a long list.You have it in the in the materials, but includes things like remaining phases of the elements. Bay, Marina rebuild remaining phases of the Naples seawalls. The Belmont Beach, an aquatic center, the Seaside Way Bridge, Belmont Pier, Pine Avenue, public dock concession stands, and many, many other smaller projects.And so what we are recommending is that the Council prioritize the existing projects that we have and go through a prioritization project process. And so we will be prioritizing those incomplete and unconstructive projects based on prioritization criteria, which are what are before you tonight.We believe by putting those criteria in front of the council and getting direction, we'll be able to use those criteria to put essentially all of our projects into a priority order list. New oil revenues when they are received, will also be assigned to that list based on the prioritization.And then we will proceed with those projects when the funding matches the estimated current project cost. This won't be a static list. We will have the council adopted this year, but then we'll be able to update it as we go through the budget process annually.And so the proposed prioritization criteria that you'll be considering tonight in ranked order are public health and safety. The extent to which it's a health project or a safety project to the number of California residents impacted. We are in the Tidelands area, so we do have to think of all of the residents in California.We're also obviously very concerned about the impact on our local residents as well, urgency and whether there's an urgency to do the project, the poor condition or of the current project or the need and unmet need that we have in our community.Number five, the contribution to the quality of life. Number six, whether or not it generates revenue and and the extent that operating costs play a factor in that as well. Number seven, the ability to attract additional funding or a match.Number eight, the lack of alternative funding sources. And number nine, the capital cost. And as we look at all the projects, we also want to bear in mind that we look at the overall diversity and balance of projects as a criteria, as an overall criteria.And so tonight, we're looking forward to your direction on those proposed criteria and and receive comments and direction. We will then take that criteria once adopted and create that list of prioritized capital projects and return to the City Council in the first quarter of 2015 for further discussion and approval of that list.We'll continue to update our projections for capital, Thailand's capital and our operating budgets and our uplands oil fund budget during the first quarter as well. And then in March is when we kick off our budget process and we'll be coming back with how does oil factor into all of our revenues.So while oil, as you see tonight, is is trending downward, there are other revenues that are moving in other directions and there's costs as well. And we'll be putting all of that into a comprehensive analysis to come back and talk to you about in March.With that, that is. Our report and staff are available to take your input on the criteria and to answer questions.Thank you. I want to thank the staff for putting together this presentation and want to share that. Vice Mayor Lowenthal and I have had an opportunity to meet regarding this issue and the agenda item tonight, which is specifically limited to prioritizing the projects that are pending in both of our districts and determining whether or not the criteriathat's been proposed by staff is something that we believe is is a is a proper way to assess what the priorities of our districts are and how we will be able to fund the most necessary projects. And I think we have a very good start.We're moving forward in a spirit of collaboration and looking forward to addressing these issues together as we move ahead. I do, and I'm going to be actually motioning at this point to approve the recommendation, and I would ask a few questions in regards to that.First of all, I will say that the number one question that I get asked about this issue in my district is whether or not this is going to impact the building of the Belmont Pool. That's the first question I get.Well, actually, it depends on what community I'm in, but the first general question I get is whether it's going to impact the pool. If I'm in Naples, they ask if it's going to impact the sea walls and if I'm near a body of water, they ask if it's going to impact the marina.But generally speaking, people are concerned about whether it's going to impact the pool. And I will say, I think it's important to note that and perhaps Mr. Modica can help me with this, the pool where we're approximately 12 months away from being in a position where we would be able to start construction on the pool because westill need to go through the Coastal Commission process. Is that correct?That is correct. There's a number of steps that we still need to do. We need to unveil the Environmental Impact Report and to comment on that and on the design and then go through the entitlement process, including the Coastal Commission.So we are at least a year away, if not longer.And so we would not be in a position to fully fund the pool and begin construction this year regardless of the condition of the Tidelands Fund. Is that correct?Correct. At our at our most aggressive estimate, if all funding were available, we would not begin construction until the beginning of 2016. Okay.And as I understand from your comments, Mr. Modica, we will be this is whatever priority list we come up with is not it's going to be fluid and we're going to adjust as the market adjusts and as funds become available.Would that be accurate?Absolutely.In regards to and and so we my my position has always been that I would rather build the right pool for our city than a lesser pool based on a fluctuating budget that could change at any time. And that that it's my opinion that we wait and we do it right.And that is just the prudent thing to do and it's the fiscally responsible thing to do. And that's just my personal opinion. In regards to the operating budget and this is perhaps a question for for Mr. West and he and I have talked about this.I think it's really important at this juncture that we take a look at our operating budget and make a determination as to whether all of the charges that are going to that fund are appropriate and that we are exercising diligence and making sure that we're not charging anything to that budget that perhaps doesn't belong in that area. Mr. West, is that something that you think city staff is committed to or can take a look at?Absolutely. We're committed to that and we will look at that.Okay. Because I think if there's opportunities to tighten that budget up a little bit more in terms of what we're charging to it, then then the deficit issues may be lessened to that potential deficit. So that's something that I would request be given some priority.And my understanding is that we are going to come back at some date certain to talk about the specific projects and the priority list for those projects. When do we expect that to be?So in our report, we were saying the first quarter of 2015, which essentially means February or March. So I think we're shooting between March, end of March as the time frame to come back once we get this criteria will be going through it and kind of ranking each one, probably using a color coded type of a systemso that it's easy to and visual to see and then put those in a list to see how much funding we have to fund the projects and then bring that back.I want to take a moment to thank our Parks Rec and Marine Department. I had an opportunity last week to take a tour and look at all of the bathrooms in. That are on the project list in my district in the Tidelands area, and it was very informative.I mean, we literally went in and looked at every stall and tried to be to think in a fiscally prudent way to determine, is this something that we can rehabilitate by changing a few tiles or changing the paint?Or is this something that we really, truly need to rebuild? And I think that for me, that was a very diligent and thorough process because it has allowed me, in my mind at least to reprioritize a few projects.And I think that that's just something we're going to need to do. The reality of this fund is that it is a fluctuating fund, and just like one would do in a regular household budget, we have to make some adjustments in light of the fluctuations.And so I do expect that as a result of the information I received from our city staff during the tour, that was very helpful to me that that we will really be focusing on things that need to be fixed and need to be repaired, and so that we are as fiscally prudent as we can be with theamount of money that we have, understanding what a what an asset is it is to the city. So I want to thank staff for their work and for educating us on the issues and giving us the options that you've prepared tonight and for working with us to come up with the best possible solutions in light of thecircumstances. So thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilmember Ringo.Thank you, Mayor. In looking at these criteria for prioritization, I see somewhat of a relationship between number seven and eight. In regards to revenue can be made on some of these projects eight and one number seven says the ability to attract additional funding.And number eight says a lack of alternative funding. But in the wording here, it has the extent of number seven, the extent to which partially funding this project from talent funds will result in additional funding from Nancy Resources to support the project.The projected financing and eight. It says the extent to which the project lacks the ability to be funded from other city sources. There's somewhat of a contradiction there. So what I would I would ask you maybe to change number eight, to see the ability to look or seek or get additional funding by either these these these methods, as opposed to saying the lack of it. We need to look at positive ways of trying to generate some revenue that would supplement or add to the criteria so that we could be in a stronger position to look at those.So any comment on that?Yeah, Councilman, we're actually we're we're in agreement with that. The reason it reads this way is we were trying to set up a metric that was consistent so that when we use a red, yellow and green and green means the same thing for each one.So in this one, if it had if it lacks the ability to be funded, it would probably be a one that is green rather than red. It just has to do with the scale that we were using. But we totally agree with you.It's it's the question is whether or not this thing in this project has to be funded out of Highlands or it'll get a different score if it can be funded out of a different funding source are opposed to.And when I say different funding source, we're not talking general fund. That's the one thing that everything could have been funded by the General Fund. It's we're talking grants or assessments or donations, those types of things.Well, I'm always very complimentary of people who have fully sighted with color. I'm colorblind. So the only thing that I can rely on are words. So if it's not clearly stated, color coding doesn't doesn't help me understand. So that's why I bring that up in regards to the the prices of oil.We saw the chart here in terms of the projections for the next four years to 20, 20 or six years. And it has there been any discussion in terms of where we're at? Lowering the bar, if you will, from the 70 to 80 something that's more reasonable with what's going on in the oil markets as a wholeand what other agencies are doing to adjust their budgets from 65 to 50 7 to 40 or whatever I would look at, yeah, if we were, if we were at 70 and we're projecting a 30% loss, maybe we're looking at putting it somewhere between 40 and 50 so that when in the event the price stabilizes and itstarts coming back up and the projections are that it will be around 60 to 65, we at least have a little buffer that we can have between now and 2020. How does that how does that look?It's there. We think that's exactly the right thing that we should be doing. We plan to be doing that in the next several months as we go through our 16 budget development process. And we'll be recommending to you what that new number should be.I don't think we're prepared today to say whether it's a certain number, but that will be what we recommend in the budget to the council. And then the council will have the ultimate ability to say we want to lower it and which will have an impact on the general fund but actually have higher impact on on capitalthat would come in or, you know, maybe go the other direction. So we'll we'll definitely have a recommendation for you on that.And I know it's a little premature to bring this up now, perhaps, but for my council colleagues, we might want to start revisiting some of these funds and the the assessments that we have currently that would that have been stable for many years.And when I look at revisiting those and making some adjustments to that, and I'm specifically looking at the you you to the utility users tax as a one that we need to revisit. It's been with that ten or 12 years maybe since we changed it, we might want to revisit that.And that's that's just a comment. Let me say it might be premature. The the the the sky hasn't fallen yet, but it's certainly something that we might want to consider. Thank you.Thank you. Councilmember Kathryn Richardson.Thank you. So. Right, I. Appreciate that. A lot of this has been worked over and reviewed by both of the council members with titling areas. I think it's that is the appropriate way to do things when local council members become experts on these projects is very difficult for us without knowing the nuances of these projects to tohelp establish a priority for one project versus the other. So that is a good thing. I have a few comments and questions. One. Regarding the uplands fund. How much? I know we we we budget our general fund based on this volatile commodity.How, how much of our budget, what percentage of our budget is based on oil revenue.For the operating budget? That number is in the general fund. It is 4.4%.4.4%. And and. Okay. And then when timelines factors in I know that they take on certain services that that our general fund doesn't have to take in. Is that considered in factored into that 4.4% as well?No, that's a different percent. I don't have that on the top of my head. I don't know if John has it.Okay.The the Tidelands Fund is is a it's separately calculated. So, no, we don't.Have there's no way to evaluate like how much, how dependent we are on. Oh, well, you know, it doesn't matter. I know that you were going to come back with some recommendations soon on how to make those adjustments.I would just chime in and just say that, you know, now is the time. We we are seeing what the what the impact is on basing our our budgets, our police and fire vital services on oil funds. It's not it's a gamble for our constituents.And I think we need to continue to have a discussion about new revenue, identifying new revenue. So I would hope and expect to see when these things come back with some recommendations that it's a balanced recommendation where we look at adjustments to the budget, whether that means cuts, but also opportunities for new revenue as we move forward. Secondly, so what so we we budgeted $70 a barrel in UPLANDS for operating, correct?Yes, sir.And what do we budget per barrel entitlements.Same thing. We budget $70 as the operating amount. And then we had planned out a five year capital plan at the time based on $100 a barrel, knowing that if it dropped, then projects would need to be extended out further until funding was available.So the expectation that, you know, if we don't have those resources, then for infrastructure for a one time projects, we can extend those and we can extend services on an ongoing basis. Right. Is that the thinking behind that?Correct.And the council really should be applauded for taking such a conservative approach with such a volatile substance. So and, you know, both in operating and in capital, it's actually been very, you know, very encouraging that the council over the last several years has been very diligent in being conservative.And I think that's that's been very good for us. However, this this is kind of a unique time where it's dropped even further than than what anybody had expected.Well, I would say that this experience underscores why we shouldn't necessarily be conservative when it comes to operating, but we should also do the same thing as it comes to capital projects. Why base a plan around development of a project based on a certain level of income with the plan that if this goes away, we'll just extendthe project? I would think we need to keep that same approach for capital as we have with operations, but that's just my opinion. And then lastly, one of the criteria that I think is I see a lot of criteria here.And and obviously I think, you know, what you're doing here. And I would just say one thing, you know, we're taking steps to to do local hiring. We're taking steps to consider adopting a project labor agreement. I just think that with a lot of these things, we always talk about the impact that these infrastructure projects have onthe whole city, and that should be considered. The job aspect needs to be considered in this criteria. Like what does one project in terms of jobs mean versus another project? Does does it make sense to advance one project that has a larger impact on local hire and an economic impact than it does to advance another?So that would be just a suggestion to the maker of the motion to include that as well. It's okay. I'll give it to you again. No problem.It's all good. For good.I would say. Would you would you would you be okay with adding in jobs? You know, economic impact to everyone, like jobs to one of your criteria as you figure these these infrastructure projects out. Yeah. I think jobs for Lumbee should be considered in the criteria, as you know, as we decide.Does it make sense to move one project versus the other? That's something that should be factored into the actual factor in.Member? Richardson That's a really great point, but I don't think that that's something that we'd be prepared to. And I'm not going to speak for Vice Mayor Lowenthal. I certainly would not be prepared to go down that road.Right now, there are a lot of projects in there that I don't know that everyone on council is as familiar with. I mean, we live and breathe these projects. And so is it more important to me that the residents of Naples have seawalls that keep them seismically safe or that people get jobs?Seismic safety is obviously. I get it. I think I do. Or, for example, is it important that that, you know, a bathroom in our neighborhood has the ability to have a flushing toilet that's more important to us than jobs?So I think, you know, it's a good point and it's certainly a valid point, but I think it really is something that you have to have a deep understanding of the specific projects, because the focus of these projects are, for the most part, public health and safety and that kind of thing for a lot.By no means would ever want to make you choose between a job and a toilet. That is not the point of what I'm saying. What I'm saying is the point of what I'm saying is, you know, a lot of us on the council, we rarely engage in these timelines issues when it comes to us here at thecouncil. We in good faith a lot of times go along with the council member in District two, in District three, and we've had a long discussion about jobs and local hire and stuff moving forward. I would just think that if we're going to continue to say that these projects are city wide projects, then it should be representedin the documents and the criterias we put forth. I'm pretty sure city staff is going to confer with the council members as we move these projects forward. I just think that it is it is a good point to say as we evaluate criteria for projects, we look at the local job piece and that's fine.That's fine if we don't want to do that. I just wanted to.Say I think it's a good point, but I will say that any policy that we set as a council in regards to local hire will apply to Tidelands projects as well. Those are considered city projects. So if we have, for example, a play in effect that would apply to all city projects, presumably unless there's an exemption for, you know, a specific type of project. Is that correct? Mr.. City Attorney.Mayor invites member members of the Council. There could be exceptions under Tidelands that would prohibit the certain aspects of a play, for example, or would have to be tailored specifically because of the restrictions on the Tidelands funds. It couldn't impact like a Long Beach hire.It would have to be a regional or a regional impact. And so the economic benefit could be taken into effect, but it couldn't be directed specifically to Long Beach residents.So that my view wouldn't be my suggestion wasn't limited to like a play or a union job. I just think when staff considers a priority for what projects, we should always keep jobs in mind as a criteria. That's just the point.And Councilmember Watterson as a second year of the motion. Mr. Mayor, I'm sorry, I just.You're actually cued up next.Good. Thank you. I think what you raise and address is something that everyone on this council is behind. And so I trust that the staff has that in mind when we're going forward. But as Councilmember Price and city attorney affirms, in some of these situations, we don't really have a choice to prioritize that at the top ofthe list, but certainly it is a priority. Thank you. Oh, I am queued up. I just.That was you.Thank you. I wanted to thank Councilmember Price for the extensive work that she has done with her constituents regarding the projects. And I know that this particular item and this meeting is not to discuss projects specifically, but really our set of priorities.And so I think the list will achieve the intended result of prioritizing the available funding that we have for Tidelands projects. I want to thank staff for helping us work through how we can continue to fund the most critical projects.As Councilmember Price mentioned, the criticality of these projects. Sometimes it doesn't seem obvious when we're just talking about a restroom facility, but it really is obvious there is a safety issue and the way these restrooms have been redesigned will ensure that we offer as much safety to the extent possible.Now I want to just re restate my commitment to working with Councilmember Price and the rest of the Council to ensure that the projects move forward in the interest of our residents and businesses. And while all these projects are within our two districts, when you look at the patronage, especially the huge amount of patronage, that is whetherit's at Bixby Park or in the downtown area of the block from all over the city. And in large part, they're also from other parts of cities around us. So it's a great obligation that we have to ensure that it is as inviting and attractive and safe as possible.Thank you.Thank you.Councilor Andrews. Yes, thank you. I have a question, you know, to the Mr. Walker, what what impact would this have on our civic center? If things continue to go at the rate is going now.So we don't expect an impact to the civic center from oil. The funding source that we are using to as part of the DB UFO DB foam isn't specifically oil related. It's from the Civic Center Fund and all the other funds in the general fund.But it certainly oil does impact our general fund. So we'll have to as we update our project, we'll have to make sure that there is available funds to be able to as we update our budget, available funds to be able to fund that commitment.Yes. And also, I'd like to commend, you know, our vice mayor and Mrs. Price, you know, in the way in which you individually are working on these projects, especially when we talk about priorities. Because the fact that, you know, I'm just like Rex, you know, my whole, whole concept is all the way.It's about jobs. And if I know the priorities come into that, I would hope that anything that you talk them down along the shoreline, anything else, it would be local jobs. You know, I understand that we can do a lot of those things.But if you do in prioritizing those things, I would really hope that you would take that into consideration. Thank you.Thank you. I don't see any other comments. Are there any public comment? Please come forward.That evening. Council staff My name is Susan Miller. I've lived across from Belmont Pool for 22 and a half years. First of all, I'd like to thank the city for protecting the old growth trees during the demolition of the pool.This is a renewed energy in this park land with the hummingbirds, the squirrels, the monarch butterflies. We wait the migration of the snowy egrets in the black crowned night herons. The pool project being considered at Belmont Plaza would require expansive site preparations due to the liquefaction ground and the new sea level rising rules, which require raising theentire structure. These two factors alone could mean wasting 30 to $40 million if this site is selected. Instead, this site can easily be restored to a beautiful natural park on the ocean. Make it in an area that can be enjoyed by residents, visitors in the increasing wildlife population.This was the intent of the California Coastal Act and the local coastal program. It would cost very little to return this area to a natural park, but the value is priceless. The oil market has changed the title and funds adequately and projects that are truly needed must become Ford luxuries.If and when the funds are available for an aquatic facility. A downtown location such as the Harry Bridges Memorial Park is ideal for this purpose and would be covered by the tidal bond funds. There is far less site preparation that would be needed.Plenty of existing parking doesn't negatively impact the endangered birds, would not intrude on reserve residential neighborhood, and has easier access for those traveling to the aquatic center. Most importantly, there would be substantial cost savings to end up with the same facility.Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Your timing is not very good. Hugh Clark has the address. First of all, is this suggestion for the council person that has color blind issues? I think that's easily addressed. Seem to be we can put the city staff can put on BGR.In other words, the first letter of what the color is. Put it in bold. I need sheet for. A number of issues. First of all, I think this this argues well for immediately stopping. Any further urination of money relative to the bike path of the extended bike path.The dual one going down. Whatever is there now of the if it's not filled in. Cover it up with sand. If we get money later, I think by that time we'll be able to get some clear thinking and realize it's a it's folly to do it anyway.I want to make sure, absolutely sure that we're that there's a clear understanding of what the projects are. I heard for the first time that I've ever heard the word Belmont Beach Aquatic Center. I don't know where that is.I've never seen that in any any city listing. Want to make sure. Also that note, we don't go within 100 yards, 200 yards, a leeway center. That building does not need to come down. There certainly could be some renovations within this existing the existing footprint, so forth.Additionally, no single state, no structure within the Marine Stadium needs to be touched, period. I want to make sure that that doesn't that doesn't happen. The restrooms that are there that are used only at special events and they're fine that are operational.I'm speaking at the three. Yes. Will be rebuilt. And the cost for that will not be borne by the taxpayers, that the courts will make the decision and assign the portion of liability to those found complicit in the crime of not only taking it down, which I believe was close to 300,000, but rebuilding it.And the last thing is I want to make sure that. The. The Belmont pool itself goes through. As was originally planned. It is not that is that swimming pool is actually a magic I think to the aquatic dynamic here and to return it to a.Open Space Park. Is at war with, I think, the concept of a full range of aquatic dynamics and so forth. Obviously it's going to be tough. We will find the money eventually, but I strongly object to returning it back to what it was before the pool was there.Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker.Please. Gonzales that is on file. My comments are in line with the previous speaker, the speaker before the previous speaker about the Harriet Perry Bridges Memorial Park. I just wanted to just make one suggestion about the proposed prioritization criteria.I would like for impacts to the environment to be considered, especially considering that these revenues are oil driven revenues. And some of the procedures to drive this or this oil are unconventional and controversial at best. I also did want to say that I support the councilmembers comment that the city look into generating new revenue with whatever whateveris set forth with these funds. And I also wanted to be very specific about the $22 million that are unassigned. I wanted to ask that less than a 10th, actually, 1/22, 121 20th of $1,000,000 be set towards something that can actually generate energy, clean energy.I just think that would be a very symbolic gesture to one of our buildings by generating solar energy or some sort of green technology to one of our parks or to one of our buildings. I believe if we're going to take the money from an oil source, it would be appropriate to reinvest it in technology of thefuture. I know that we often speak about these types of things on Earth Day or things like that, but it would be great to see that practice in action. Thank you.Thank you. See no other public speakers. There is a motion on the floor by Councilwoman Price and Vice Mayor Lowenthal. And I just want to add that I did like Councilman Price this last week, and I did my own unofficial Tidelands tour, and I ran from the Villa Riviera and went and visited all of our new restroomsand went all up and down the Titans through past the around the peninsula and back over to to Naples. And one thing that I was really struck by is first, the amount of work that is currently happening right now on the Tidelands.And if you haven't had a chance to run up and down the coast, it is amazing the amount of work that's happening, not just clearly the Bluff Project and the The Path project, but the new bathrooms that have been installed.The work that's happening up and down. And so I just wanted to take a moment to also just kind of call out Eric, who's in the audience here. And if you don't know Eric, you know, Eric does an incredible amount of work in the Highlands area and, you know, thank you and the whole kind of tidelands teamfor for all those projects, it is not easy to manage and they're doing a really good job on that. So thank you very much. With that, there's a motion. Please cast your votes.Motion carries seven zero.Thank you.

The Chair recognizes the at large council from Dorchester Councilor Julian McKeon.Thank you, Mr. President. We passed this resolution last year to bring awareness to people experiencing dyslexia, and we're happy to be refiling this resolution again this year. Dyslexia is a learning disorder that involves difficulty, difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words.In parentheses, decoding. Also called reading disability. Dyslexia affects areas of the brain that process language. It is very common affecting 20% of the population and representing 80 to 90% of all of those with learning disabilities. But that doesn't mean that all of these people will go on to be successful.In fact, many famous people have some form of dyslexia, including Whoopi Goldberg, Jennifer Aniston, Albert Einstein, Muhammad Ali and Danny Glover. This is a month for us to not only celebrate the accomplishments of people who live with dyslexia, but to reaffirm our commitment to creating spaces and opportunities for all the different learning backgrounds and styles.And I'm incredibly grateful to parents on Fabian Agle, who was always out in the forefront championing this issue. And for that reason, I move that we suspend and pass the rules and pass this resolution. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman. Here.Would anyone else wish.To speak on docket 1082?

Read the first time and lead over for the next regular meeting of the City Council for final reading, declaring the urgency thereof and declaring that this ordinance shall take effect immediatelycitywide.Thank you, Madam Clerk. I have a motion by Councilwoman Price and a second by Councilwoman Gonzales. Councilwoman Price.Thank you, Vice Mayor. I just have a quick question before we move forward tonight. So the way that this is structured, Mr. Mays, I just want to confirm with you the copy process for the delivery operations. They would have a process they'd have to go through.Once council takes up the issue of whether to allow storefronts, they would have to apply for a copy for the storefront. They don't automatically convert. Is that correct?Councilwoman Price Members of the City Council is partially correct. We have a process that relates to coops. If council did authorize the storefront dispensaries, they would be able to apply for a modification to their existing CFP that would permit that activity and the same types of conditions that would typically be imposed for a see a new cupwould likely be imposed at that time. So it's it's part of the CPA process, but it definitely will have a public hearing appealable to the city council. Okay. Other protections.Because what I'm thinking about is that when they if for the for the companies that apply for the delivery only model our analysis would it be limited to the operation of a brick and mortar site for delivery? No onsite sales?Or would we be looking at the future, the possible impacts to the community, etc., for on site sales when we're making a decision as to the delivery operation?If I understood your quip, if I understood your question, the Council would have the opportunity if you wanted to go further with a brick and mortar retail outlet to look at everything you would be able to. You could, in theory, require a separate CFP.We would recommend modifying the original one, but usually that's left in the hands of staff to fashion conditions that would be appropriate to a retail outlet. And the ordinance that we did draft for your consideration already has built into it many of the types of things and requirements perform operational standards that you would expect for a bricksand mortar facility if it went in that direction.Okay. So just a I'm just to clarify, though, let's say we're okay with a delivery operation at a particular site, but that site wouldn't necessarily lend itself well to an on site on site sales, whether it's, you know, crime stats in the area, lighting, neighborhood, proximity to a particular problematic site, whatever the case may be, the analysisthat we would take for a regular CFP application, it may be that that location is perfect for a delivery only facility, but not for an on site sales.That's correct. The matter would first go to the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission would have to make a finding that the use at that location, the modification was appropriate. If findings couldn't be made, it would be conceivably denied at the Planning Commission level.The applicant would still be able to appeal that determination to the city council.Or they could find another location.Correct.Okay. Thank you.Thank you. Are we still are we at the start of the hearing here or did we have a staff reporter? No. Okay. So. Okay. So. Okay. Got it. Got it. So. Well, actually, just to make sure. I want to make sure we do.Know. I know this is a hearing. Did we do? There's no oath required in the hearing. Did Mr. Mason, do you want to say anything additional as far as before I go to the second of the motion?Well, I if if the counsel would like me to give a staff report, I certainly could. I will say an abbreviated form of the staff report is we did incorporate into the draft ordinance before you. All of the items that counsel did request on December eight.If you would like me to go through those in detail, I'd be more than happy to do that. But if not, that's fine too.Okay. Sounds like we're just moving forward because you have started the start of the process, so I know you all have that the material. The second part of the motion was Councilwoman Gonzales.Yes. Just a quick question. I think I believe I already had this answered, but the 6% business license tax, we can the maximum would be 10%.Is that correct?Right now we've set it at 6%.When the initiative was placed on the ballot and put before the voters, they voted for a range, starting initially at 6%. But we built into that ordinance that was voted for the ability of city council to raise that anywhere between six and 10%.But that's not part of what's on the agenda tonight. But at a future date. Yes, you could do that.Okay.And then I just want to confirm in here in your report, the sink, the sanctioned ratio versus versus unsanctioned. Are we still looking at 1 to 6? Is that.Correct?I remember seeing that in the last report. And I just want to make sure when we're looking at these costs, that if that's what we're facing, this.Off of.The Eriksson. Assistant Finance Director will answer for staff.So, Councilwoman Gonzalez, when we had the varying number of dispensaries, we realized that it's probably more a facet of the demand in the city of Long Beach is more than a ratio of 1 to 6. So if there's only four dispensaries, the ratio might go up.So for this round of analysis, we actually assumed roughly 50 dispensaries total in the city of Long Beach. That would be unsanctioned. Okay. Okay. Great. And I think that's it at this time. Thank you.Thank you. I'm going to just keep going down this list. Did you guys go to the public? Did you go to the public? Okay. So I'm going to just keep going, Councilman Richardson.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. There's a couple questions and then another thought on this. Mm hmm. So I know that we went through months and months of, you know, task force meetings and a lot of resources spent on this and and an iteration of the ordinance.Now, my my first question is, what is the timeline from adoption of this ordinance to full implementation of open retail facilities? Seven. The full implementation.Councilmember Richardson. So we worked with the Department of Development Services and other departments to look at when we could actually reasonably do the process. And. We would start with the application process in March of 2016 that would be completed, the copy applications would be done in April and the CP process in November of 16.Planned process check would probably be completed of January of 17. And so January 17 would be the estimated date first delivery dispensary would actually open. Six months later we would have the report back to Council on Fiscal Impact and Safety Issues.That would be July of 2017. So if a city council chose to open onsite store fronts, we would end up having a copy modification process that that mine, which the earliest that could probably possibly be completed would probably be October 2017.And so that would be when we would have the first retail dispensary. Then six months after that April 2018, we City Council would look at considering three additional dispensaries. And because at that point, these would be new locations with a full copy process, the earliest those three additional dispensaries would possibly open is looking like to be Marchof 2019.Okay. So this ordinance, the timeline from today to full implementation puts us at March of 2019. Which we should be in our new civic center, I think, around that time. I think the original intent was to put forth sound public policy and actually take a step in that direction.And that's just not what this is not what's happening today. I think this is really insincere, is a waste of time and resources. My next question is my next question is, will this still have a fiscal impact on the city if we move forward with this?I mean, I know that was a major concern leveled by a number of council members. But I think this proposal, as I understand it, still costs resources that won't be fully recouped. Is that true?Councilmember Richardson. So, yes, we did look at both the the upfront cost, the one time cost and the ramp up cost related to implementing and administering this ordinance as well as the revenues that would be received once the the dispensaries are opening or opened.And the timeline that I had mentioned before and when we looked at that, there was a shortfall between revenues and expense in 16, 17 and 18, which we are recommending. If that was the case, we would be using one time resources to get through that period totaling about 2.4 million.And then once we get to seven dispensaries, we would be at a break even point where ongoing revenues would cover ongoing expenses. In order to do that, we did have to ask departments to to reduce some of their their administration costs.And this is all just rough estimates based on a set of assumptions. So the actual results could vary.So. So that said, here's here's what I'm thinking. This is not smart in terms of fiscal policy. It doesn't achieve any particular public policy goal. I know that. I mean, we've been through this. So there is not consensus on the council to do a more robust policy.So I don't think we should move forward. So I. And I know that. And I'll just want to say this. A lot of work's been done by a lot of council members. Vice Mayor Lowenthal. I know this most recent motion is Council Member Suzy Price.And I would say that and I want to thank everybody for their hard work, but I think enough is enough. So I think we should. There are we know that there are a number of ballot initiatives happening across the state, potential rumors of local ballot initiatives.If we're not going to give it a good run at it, I think we should stop here. So I'm going to offer a substitute motion to receive a 5/2.Okay. There's a substitute motion to receive and file. Just to clarify, Mr. Mays, a receiving file would not move the ordinance forward in a nutshell, correct?That's correct. And the current ban that's in place would remain in place.Okay. Can I ask you a question? I know we have a couple of speakers, but there were some state mandates as far as dates. I just I just want to make sure that we understand what those are and we can get through the other speakers first.But I, I don't know that those have an impact to this discussion or not.A couple of weeks ago, they probably would, but today I don't think that they do. When the original Medical Marijuana Regulatory Act was passed back in October of 2015, there was a provision in one of those three laws that said that if city councils did not adopt a regulatory ordinance dealing specifically with cultivation by March 1st, 2016, the state law in that regard would automatically be imposed. Since that time, the person who authored that portion of the bill realized that or at least put out a statement that that March 1st deadline was put in there in error.And recently he put forth an urgency measure that now as of today was passed by both of the state and. The Assembly and the Senate to do away with that March 1st criteria, because it had the unintended effect of cities adopting bans because they couldn't get up and running by March 1st.As we speak, I don't believe it has yet been signed by the governor, but the governor has given every indication he will sign that. So the March 1st date should go away. So I feel fairly confident that if the receiving file is passed, the ban would stay in place and the state law regulation in regard to cultivationwould not be imposed on the city. That's my best estimate of what would happen.Okay. Councilmember, your anger.Okay. Point of clarification. In terms of if we receive a file, this report here and there you see a ban would be in place. Should there be an initiative on a ballot? In a ballot initiative pass? What is the status of the ban?Councilmember Urania if a obviously would depend on what the ballot initiative was, but if it was a ballot initiative that put forth a regulatory ordinance and it was passed by the people, and assuming the city did not put on like L.A. did a competing ballot initiative, the ban would dissolve.By virtue of that public vote. Okay.Thank you. Well, I have to agree with Councilman Richardson in the sense that there's been a lot of work that's been put into this. When I brought this forward with Councilmember Lowenthal, we were talking about creating the task force, and we created the task force wanted to review this.The task force took much longer than I would have wanted to, but it would it did its job. And I want to thank the members of the task force in coming forward and bringing in the report. I also want to thank all the the patients that came forward, who gave their personal stories in regards to what thiswould mean for them. And and I want to thank, of course, the city attorney. I mean, I think that the they saw one item going forward and got redirected to create another type of ordinance that was completely different from the one that was originally thought of.I wanted my intent at that time were to step out in front of this, to get to place the city of Long Beach in a position that would be at the forefront of legalizing medical marijuana, to put us at the forefront in in the state, to create an ordinance that would be a role of being a rolemodel for everybody to follow. But that did not happen. So what we have here, I think, is very much watered down. I think it's one that is not enforceable. Obviously, when you are transporting a product from one location to another, there are so many different things that can happen within a one mile stretch.There's also no guarantees about the product that you're going to be ordering and or receiving. So there's there's a lot of there's a lot of questions on this. And there's also questions about in terms of timelines. We're looking at full implementation in two years, which by that time we already have probably have something else in place.And we're also looking at getting a a break even point in terms of revenue in two years. So for the first year and a half, you know, the city will be making quite an expenditure on this, an expenditure that we can't and should not be making.And the original ordinance that we had out there would have put us right in place with that right away. In the meantime, it's it's not something that that I can support. So I'll be supporting the substitute motion to receive on file.Vice President, Joe.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I wanted to thank Councilmember Richardson for putting forward a reasonable solution to what I believe is not a workable policy. I'd like to thank the city staff, actually, because I don't know how many opportunities I'll have to do this, but especially Charlie Parkin and his team, Mike Mays and your staff for the countlesshours that you've put into this issue since I originally brought the item forward back in 2009, and then we brought it forward with current council members. So it's been almost seven years we've been trying to figure this out and opinions vary, but we may have had it right at one point.We may not have, but over seven years, constituencies and communities evolve. I do know that we've worn out many colleagues past and present, but I do thank them all for taking this journey with us. Some of them are not here at the dais today and some of you are.So this issue of medical marijuana will continue to shape and evolve and regress and evolve again and again. And that's the beauty of public policy. There is a back and forth and an ebb and flow, but our job is to actually know the pulse of our community.And what saddens me is that we had so many opportunities to do the job, to do a good job. We called on many people to participate in a task force, and then we really just let everyone down with a policy that's not a great one and not one that's workable for the city, not one that's definitely manageable. And what saddens me about that is, after all that time, we have pushed our community to take to the ballot and sometimes that's necessary. But I think having seven years to get it right and having a very thoughtful council behind the dias today would have allowed us the opportunity to come forward with meaningful public policy, having learnedfrom all of the discussion and input over the last seven years. And so I think and I would like to urge my colleagues to consider supporting this. I think receiving and filing is the best thing to do, to take no action, to not have a new ordinance in place, revert back to what we had and really letthe ballot process take place, which, for better or for worse, will be the will of the people we had an opportunity to do right, and we did not. And so many of you know that I'm very motivated by public policy and robust conversations, and I do enjoy the stamina that it takes to get things to the finishline. But I'm also very honest about what the outcome is. And I can honestly say, and I don't hide my frustration, but I can honestly say that what we are considering tonight is not the best we could have done.So I would rather have nothing than have a bad something. So, colleagues, I hope you support Councilmember Richardson. Substitute to receive and file. Thank you.Thank you. Councilwoman Pryce.I, I actually. This is music to my ears. I've been asking for us to continue the band forever, like every other city that this has come to has done since AB 266. So the question I have Mr. Mays I have a couple questions.The first is this. There's been some talk of ballot initiatives. Can you explain to us very clearly what are the ballot? And then what does the ballot initiative process look like? One, if the city has a delivery only ordinance in place and then there is an initiative that allows for storefront dispensaries that would supersede the ordinance.Correct?It probably would supersede the ban. Yes, if it was a regulatory ordinance. So in a nutshell, what could happen is the council could put an initiative ordinance on for the public to vote on, just like the council put the medical marijuana tax.If the council did not desire to do that initially, members of the public could start an initiative petition, gather enough signatures to satisfy the city clerk. And there's a percentage of signatures that must be gathered in order to qualify for the ballot.That could go on the ballot. Council. Then, as I mentioned, this happened in L.A. The city of L.A. decided to put a their council, decided to put a competing measure on that could may or may not happen in this case, assuming it qualified for the ballot.I am guessing it's pretty close to too late to qualify for June. Most likely, if it local initiative, it would qualify for November and council could decide at that time whether they wanted to put a competing measure on.And then obviously whichever of the two measures, if there were two got the most votes would pass and then the city would be required to implement that new ordinance.And so whatever the new ordinance is, what what the city has, whether it's a ban or a delivery only model, the new ordinance that would be adopted by way of petition would then supersede it.If the new ordinance or the new initiative was inconsistent with the ban, the new ordinance would take its place and I assume it would be inconsistent with a ban.Right. Okay. And. In regards to the timing of initiatives, can you talk a little bit more about that?I hate to put the clerk on the spot, but the clerk might be in a better position to talk about that.Someone who did that to her last week. Okay.I'll tell you what. We could either we could bring back an off agenda item, if you would like, that could give you the timing about initiatives in general. We could describe what it would take to potentially get it on the June ballot or more likely what it would take to get on the November statewide ballot.That would be great. So if we could do that.Be happy to do that.I just want to make a final. Comment about fiscal impact. I'm really interested and pleasantly surprised that any other council member is mentioning fiscal impact in regards to medical marijuana because this is the first. Other than Councilwoman Mango, she has mentioned it, but this is the first time I've heard some of my colleagues talk about fiscal impact. So let's talk about fiscal impact for a minute there. Since Councilman Richardson refers to my efforts in this process to compromise as a waste of money and resources. So my understanding from the first fiscal impact report that staff wrote was that it was projected that the sales tax revenue from this industry with nine dispensaries would bring intothe city $3 million. And the initial costs that were provided by multiple departments were $5 million to enforce the operations, including licensing, police and code enforcement. Then staff was asked to reevaluate the numbers and come back with a different enforcement model so that we could break even in this operation.And staff was able to do that. And what that meant was that rather than having a police based enforcement, we were going to have more of an administrative enforcement, which means for all of the unlicensed facilities that the police department using millions of dollars and hundreds of search warrants to try to shut down that process would goaway. And instead, our code enforcement officers would be sending letters and asking people to politely and nicely shut down their operations. And that was going to be our new enforcement model for $3 million in order to break out into a break even situation.So let's not talk about fiscal impact as as a way to highlight the position, because I think it's pretty clear what the fiscal impact of this marijuana statute would be for the city of Long Beach. And by all accounts, any adoption of medical marijuana as an industry in the city of Long Beach is going to have anegative fiscal impact at a time when we need more police officers patrolling our streets and helping us deal with a rise in crime. And that is the reality. Thank you.Thank you. Vice Mayor Lowenthal, them going to go to public comment?That's okay, Mr. Mayor. I don't have to have the last word. Thank you.Okay, let me go ahead and do public comment. So if you have any comments, please come forward.Very good. I go back to what the governor said a year ago this past January. California already has enough potheads. Period. It's from the governor. And he pointed out that's that we are also at or near the bottom of the barrel.In every almost every paradigm of import in the country. Period. Frankly speaking, I don't know. I don't have a friend. I don't know anybody. That smokes marijuana. This marijuana medical marijuana is bogus. Any Tom, Dick and Harry can pick one up.As they say, it is as easy as getting a promise from a politician in election time period. Kids from the high school can tell you how to get it. Period. So you just hold the line? Absolutely no. If somebody wants to move out of the city and maybe develop a policy, if somebody wants it bad enough willpay for their moving out of the city, period. But the council in the third district was absolutely correct. We have enough problems. All right. The country itself, this this state itself is our nature directory. Within the next 30 years, to be this city of Long Beach, notwithstanding that which we get accomplished, which we'll see will be somethinglike you'll find in Guatemala or Honduras, period. A fourth rate city. Below that. And if you don't think that you're clearly out of touch with what's going on, you may be fine. That I can tell you now. Your kids.Kids will be living in something a fourth world country as it is now. So what you need to do is hold the fort. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Thank you. I'm Lynn Figure and founder and CEO of Highway Distribution Group, a legally licensed distributor of medical cannabis and cannabis infused products. I'm here tonight to offer my support for the ordinance, which you have before you and urge you to pass it.I have been a California businessman for over 25 years. I have a background in real estate development in California and in Pennsylvania. I'm also a highly respected music publisher, and I recently sold my company in December of last year.I'm also a producer of concerts nationwide featuring the top touring artists of the last 40 years. For the sake of clarification, distribution as defined by the state of California means the procurement, sale and transport of medical cannabis and medical cannabis products between business entities licensed by the state as distributors.We have been given the responsibility to coordinate all legal cannabis activities in the state of California under our license. We engage in the business of purchasing medical cannabis from a licensed cultivator or medical cannabis products from licensed manufacture for the sale to a licensed dispensary.This is the first positive step in creating a legally accountable business for the sale of medical cannabis in the state of California. My primary objective is to distribute products for patients that is high quality, effectively effective, properly tested, labeled, and most of all has been produced in a facility that complies with the state and local health regulations. I am here tonight to respectfully encourage that you pass the ordinance before you and help us in establishing a reputable and trusted business. In addition, I would also like to respect the request that distributors of medical cannabis be incorporated into your ordinance.Our goal is to work cooperatively with the city.Officials, law enforcement and health officials and the community at large to understand and address the concerns that exist. We want to establish our operations in the city of Long Beach to create new jobs and taxable revenue that will benefit the local community and economy.We also want to earn the trust of the city and the community at large by giving back through programs focused on eradicating homelessness in the city of Long Beach. In closing, I urge you to pass the ordinance and to include a provision that includes the distribution of medical cannabis edibles and other derivative products in the city ofLong Beach. Thank you.Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please.Hello. I'm Mitch Klaus. I'm CEO and founder of Something Chocolate, a music inspired gourmet box chocolate that's cannabis infused. And I'm also here to encourage supportive of today's audience. I'm an entrepreneur started many businesses over the years in a variety of industries including tech magazine publishing, digital music distribution and gourmet food.And I worked with some of the biggest companies in the world in doing so. And I've created hundreds of jobs in the local, local communities in which we've in which we've operated. And I'm quite proud, quite proudly, even taking one of my companies public on Nasdaq in a Nasdaq IPO and became the largest digital independent digital musicdistributor in the world, controlling 25% of the content you see on iTunes. I began my company as a regular chocolate company. We have distribution at L.A.X. Airport. You'll even see it at Ralph's supermarkets and in places like the W Hotel, Hard Rock Hotel, Renaissance Hotel and others.I started the cannabis company for reasons that were pretty obvious that the industry needed responsibility and reliability. And my primary objective in producing a product for patients is that of high quality that are effective, taste great or properly labeled tested and most of all have been produced in a facility that complies with state and local health regulationsby licensed food managers and food handlers. Safety to our customers and quality of our products is our primary concern. So with recent passage of Mersa, the American Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act recently set forth recent rules and regulations for at the state level.But at the local level, it continues to frustrate us. While the passage of Mersa was a good start to doing things, quote unquote, by the book, the reality is the book is still not completely written, and there's plenty of blank pages in it.And that's why I'm here tonight. You have an opportunity here to start filling in those blank pages, to do the responsible thing, to help guide the industry and do something hard for a change. Doing something new is very, very difficult.This is a teachable moment for you and for us. So we can work cooperatively with the city, with city leaders, with law enforcement, with the community at large to make sure we understand your concerns and can alleviate those concerns in a way that's responsible and benefits the community, that creates jobs and that provides products to the communitythat is that are safe and tested. I believe this kind of reciprocal cooperation will result in the creation of a template that will become the model for which all city governments in the state and, frankly, in the nation that their will and that they will envy and replicate.So I really urge you to pass this ordinance before you include a provision that allows for manufacturing of edibles and other derivative products in the city of Long Beach. Thank you for listening.Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please.Hello. My name is Bill Napier. Honorable City Council. I've decided, and I think Long Beach will back me up. We'll take two punch ups. And I also want to thank you very much for approving the Breakwater study. Surfing USA.And we'll take to pot shops. And, uh, so we don't have to go out of city further than were able to go by bus or most certainly can't bike it or walk it. And, uh. Two pork chops, please.Thank you.Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please.Mayor Council members. It is with great sadness that I had to pin this. But I must tell you of my bitter disappointment with this council and the charade that's been playing out now for seven years. My engagement in legalizing medical marijuana and the other civic affairs in Long Beach at this later stage in my life have hasleft me with this notion that there really is no adherence to constituents needs and wants by this council. A recent 74% approval by ballot and over 30 to 43000 signatures must mean nothing to this Council except neat soundbites and more lip service to patients for 1/2.Think patients needs, not stoners needs. This is medicine, period. Me I'm just a Woodstock generation kid and an all around believer in the idealism of a possibility of a better tomorrow. I kept my hopes alive throughout six decades.To see my country, who I love and I cherish, become more enlightened as I age. But it is now clear that it's not going to be seen in my lifetime. The cause of marijuana legalization that I took up officially 36 years ago is still being discussed in many circles with that decidedly racist intellectual dishonesty of the 1930s. In some California cities, they are rushing to ban the evil that marijuana may bring to their city. Sadly, we're calling it the ban a palooza. This rush to prohibition does nothing to take marijuana away from the cartels, gangs, teens, and the ever growing black market.Again, with the ban, the city loses all control and the tax money that would be generated. Every business report I read says Long Beach needs more money. Now, I might not mind so much, but I've told you this before.Our surgeon general, our would be surgeon general. Sanjay Gupta has connected the dots. Weed number three, CNN special available on demand. He stated For the world to hear that PTSD symptoms can potentially be mitigated by medical grade marijuana.For heaven's sake. Even the VA has recently acknowledged that this medicine should be allowed for vets in states that permit marijuana medical marijuana. However, we have seen the VA bureaucracy and I can imagine it'll take 3 to 4 more years before that gets implemented.But how many vets will commit suicide while Long Beach waits? Why insist that a vet in need must act in a criminal manner in order to receive the herbal medicine that works for him or her? Mind you, this is at the same time as the VA is now documenting the effectiveness of PTSD, PTSD mitigation.Additionally, it is now documented that marijuana can help vets and others to break the stranglehold of alcohol, cigarets and prescription drugs. Think about the devastating pain pills that lead to heroin. L.A. Times. So still, reports evolve as I speak to you that an average of 22 vets per day kill themselves.My adult sons went before Ray Gavlak and Tonya Urunga initially in August of 2009 to beg for med pot rules, begging for VA rules. And this is where we're at today. Just two more seconds, sir. These patients are your friends and your neighbors.Every occupation, every walk of life is in the medical marijuana community. Please stop conflating legitimate medical marijuana patients and perhaps your own beliefs. Thank you, sir. Only stoner teens will be the winners. Again, I say these editorials.Thank you, sir. We're going to wrap it up. Okay.These editorials came out over and over saying we next time we got to get it right.Thank you, sir.Times did we get it right?Thank you very much, sir.We'll see.Next speaker, please.Good evening. It's an honor to be here. My name is Kyle Turley. I'm a founding member of a group called the Gridiron Cannabis Coalition. I played ten years in the National Football League. One of my partners is Jeff Chase, was one of the original dispensary owners here in Long Beach just last year.A little over a year ago, I moved back to California from Nashville, Tennessee, to take part, particularly as I am from here. So that's another reason. But to take part particular in the medical marijuana program, playing football in the National Football League brought me a number of ailments, brought our community a number of ailments.My brothers have suffered greatly because of their commitment to this dream. If we want to continue to have our children fight for these dreams, to be soldiers, to be football players, and to accomplish these great goals, we need to think about what it is we are giving them to help them along their way.Unfortunately, because of some of these career choices, this leads to long addictions, to prescription medications. Myself personally, 20 year addiction, to prescription medications that went from pain killers to psych meds to anti-inflammatories, and then into psych medications for the last seven years.And dealing with this brain injury that we now are starting to understand, if it was not for cannabis, I would not be standing here today. I would likely be standing next to my friend Junior Sayer, who is not with us, because he was not allowed to understand what cannabis could do for his brain.We heard a lot of things tonight about why this needs to happen in Long Beach, why that needs to happen to Long Beach with climate control. Alzheimer's was a discussion. There is no current medication in western medicine that addresses Alzheimer's disease like cannabis.Cannabis has been shown to reduce and stop the progression of Alzheimer's disease in multiple studies. The fact that in California and I've come back from Tennessee that we're having this conversation, it's quite archaic to me, to be honest.But at the end of the day, I hear a lot of things leading to kicking the can down the road. This no longer needs to exist. There is an initiative on the ballot to move forward, to have something in place and something is better than nothing.I urge the Council to push forward on this ballot, to allow these dispensaries, the new initiative to move forward so that something can be established, much like has been talked wildly about our health care model and that it needs to be improved.But nobody wants to throw it out because it's helping people. Cannabis will save football and it will save many communities, Long Beach included. I appreciate your time. Thank you for your understanding.And your ear.Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please.Good evening, Mayor and City Council. I'm Jack Smith. I live at 240 Chestnut Avenue in the first district. I was on the Cannabis Task Port Task Force representing the second district, which is where I lived at the time last summer.Now living in the first district. I don't have a marijuana business. I don't intend to have a marijuana business. I thankfully don't need the medicine that cannabis provides. I don't intend to use it recreationally. My goal and intent in all the attention I've been paying to this effort has been to make sure that our neighborhoods were safeand that these businesses were not a nuisance in the neighborhood. That's why I've worked so hard to help create some regulations that I believe accomplish that while accommodating the needs of medical marijuana in Long Beach. One of the things that I think could be modified now.I usually don't talk if I know I'm going to lose. And I've already counted five votes for the ban. I don't call that a lose. That's always an option since day one to continue the ban. So anyway, the point is I usually don't talk that there's no point in talking, but today I'm going to offer a potentialchange to the proposed ordinance for you to consider. That might streamline it just a little bit. I was glad Councilmember Price asked the question about the process of changing between a delivery and into a storefront. I believe if you treated the SIU process and the vetting process, that is quite complicated and lengthy and expensive in creating storefrontsites. Who could only do delivery. That are then reevaluated in the six month time period. And the only change that has to happen is that delivery is permitted. It wouldn't have to be a modification of the cup. It would just be at that point now.Now, I mean, now that you can have a storefront, you can open your doors. It would be the exact same rules and regulations as if it was a retail operation. But they can't open their doors. They can only.Deliver. And when they.Have behaved appropriately, come back. And very simply and quickly be able to open their doors for business, then the idea of eventually being able to have as many marijuana businesses as you specify. Right now you're saying seven. At that point, you might have evaluated something enough to know that a different number is appropriate.So I think that you have an ordinance in front of you now that can be slightly modified to clarify that process, process to make it a little more streamlined. Also, the businesses would not have to be a delivery business and in a totally different process for a retail business.The same business could continue in this city, having demonstrated that they're a good business for our city. I hate to see you punt. It is Super Bowl week, though, so punt, if you will. And I would encourage you to.Pass the ordinance that you.Have with some minor modifications. Thanks.Thank you, Jack. Next speaker for final speaker.When he was somebody left to phone or something up here present for the. Excuse me. I hope you've all read The Beachcomber. I hope you've all been reading The Beachcomber. I know Ms.. Price thinks Mr. Downing is very dangerous and has said so.I believe she's very dangerous as a prohibitionist. I believe we should recall our city attorney.For giving erroneous advice to this council and previous councils.By Mr. Shannon as well. He's followed the same line as with Mr. Shannon and the reason we've had 20 years. Of. No action, really. It's because of the prohibitionists inordinate influence over this council. And our local criminal justice membership.We need to do something about this, but it isn't what you're doing.You need to excuse yourselves from the discussion and.Follow state law only. I believe state law says that the dispensary, the the delivery service must be connected to a dispensary. So to have just delivery services doesn't work.It won't work. Fiscal responsibility.This Council and previous councils and our law enforcement.Agency, the Long Beach Police Department, have spent billions. Billions. To avoid dealing.With this issue. To keep a ban in place.That's the prohibitionist agenda. The prohibitionist agenda is corruption. Clearly it's corruption. Read The Beachcomber if you want to know what's going on in City Hall. Thank you.Thank you, sir. Next beaker, please.My name is Nicholas Khemka. I live in the second district. Long Beach has recently developed a program for delivery of medical marijuana, and I applaud the city for that. For many years. There's been a lot of hand-waving by some people behind me, by some people in front of me about safe access.I believe delivery does provide safe access, safe access for patients, safe access for other people who are not users. But in reality, for a lot of people, it's not about safe access, it's about profit. Clearly, some of the people behind me profit from this.And if anybody in front of me profits from it, it conforms to the definition of the elements of malfeasance as defined by appellate courts. My second and last point is that the size of the Long Beach Police Department has decreased from about a thousand officers to 700, and that's 300 officers less to deal with documented cases ofmurders. Attempted murders, arson, illegal drug use and sales. Assaults, batteries and large numbers of property crimes. And note that this also lowers our property values and it interferes with other people's constitutional rights to live peacefully and safely. Allowing storefront storefront dispensaries to be reestablished.Might also meet some of the definitions of malfeasance. And this, in turn, opens up the city to lawsuits. And that's taxpayer money. I beg the city to adopt a delivery only model. For marijuana, medical marijuana. And that safe access for patients and it's safe for everybody else.Thank you.Thank you. Final speaker, please.Hi, my name's Stephanie Dawson. So I'm a resident district to my.Address is on file. I'm going to be very brief.The Rand Corporation recently came out with a very expansive study that surveyed both medical and recreational patients. I think going forward for both for regulation purposes and for whatever audience comes out of this this process, again, I would be in strict opposition to the current audits that that's being proposed for a myriad of reasons.One of which being, if you look at the particular at this survey that the RAND Corporation recently concluded, the particular section on concentrates and edible production within the city of Long Beach is not going to be serving the interest of patients.One of the things that they came out that one of the interesting things that came out of this because of the survey was a result showing that medical patients, one, spend more money on their own on their weekly amount of marijuana than admitted recreational users, and they are more likely to book to use vaporizers and edibles asa means of consumption, something in the range of 70% for both vaporizing and edibles versus 90% for smoking flower, which is mostly associated with recreational use. This means that without a clear manufacturing license or the ability availability of commercial kitchens under an ordinance, a license activity that under.So, by the way, we're going to be creating a negative environment that will more likely suit recreational users than actual legitimate qualified medical patients. That is the present ordinance as constructed. I urge you, please, to disregard it entirely and to start anew that you have a good day.Thank you. With that, I'm going to go back to the council. There is a motion and a second by Councilmember Richardson to receive and file, which would essentially not move forward with the ordinance. And a second by Vice Mayor Lowenthal, please, Councilwoman Price.Terms. If the city council adopted an ordinance that had buffer zones in place for brick and mortar operations and a subsequent ballot initiative was passed hypothetically with no buffer zones or less buffer zones. What would happen then?In that hypothetical, the buffer zones would disappear the in if if the ordinance that we had on the books was inconsistent with the one that was voted on, then the the voted on measure would take precedence.So regardless of what is in place prior to a ballot initiative. Early speak the. Because it would be inconsistent with the ordinance. Presumably that would be the reason for the ballot initiative, correct? Okay, great. Thank you.Thank you. Bye. Okay. Vice Mayor Lowenthal.Thank you. And I appreciate Councilman Councilwoman Price's questions. I don't want there to be a supposition that the ballot measure would have taken place if this council had actually developed a good policy. A lot of the partners that are motivated behind the ballot measure were also working with this council very honestly and very sincerely to develop apolicy, come up with the buffer zones, all of which had agreement and general agreement. So none of that. Was in place and therefore folks are going to the ballot measures. So I don't want us to be left with this impression that this ballot measure was going to happen anyway.So it's okay. Whatever policy we had, if we had a good policy, I assure you, no one would have gone to the ballot. Thank you.Councilwoman Gonzalez.A quick question about the ballot information, Mr. Mays, you said you would be drafting some sort of information for us. When would that be likely to come back? Do we have to formally ask you at this time?But I hopefully would be able to prepare that by next week and send it to you on and off. And the item and it would basically just describe what the ballot initiative, the local ballot initiative process was.Okay. So that would.Be by next.Week or so. Thank you.A county councilman Richardson.Just want to be clear, the motion here that I or doesn't and my comments haven't said that I plan on or I haven't heard from the City Council that it plans on placing an item on the agenda. What I said was what I said was I you know, I have heard of initiatives happening both in the stateand locally around this issue. To clarify my position. I don't think if if an idea was a good idea, it's okay to bear a fiscal impact if it is, you know, additional hours in the library, if it is expanding summer hours for be safe.Those things all have a fiscal impact. And I'm okay with that because those are good ideas that it sound public policy. What I'm saying here is if that's not if that there's not true consensus, if no one on the council is truly expressing something that's a true compromise motion, then we shouldn't proceed on this process.I'm not saying anything about a ballot measure in the future. If someone puts forth a ballot measure, I honestly believe that if we put forth sound public policy, we probably wouldn't be in a position where we hear from the community about ballot measures.So I just want to be clear. I'm not saying that we should stop this and then start a ballot initiative on behalf of the city council.Okay. So that is that they're going to go and go to a vote, which is Councilmember Richardson's motion to receive and file. How I was just alerted by the clerk that the rebooting the voting system, is that correct?It's still not rebooted. Okay. So I'm going to I'm going to have to take a hand vote.Just to be clear, Mayor, this would be the substitute motion, correct?This is a substitute motion to receive and file. And Mr. Mays, the city clerk, told me that the voting machine is not working. So which would do a hand vote or.A hand vote would be fine.Okay. So what we're going to do then is, is counsel. So if you are in favor of the motion, which is the substitute motion to receive and file. Oh, the voting is a backup. Okay, just kidding. So forget that.Sorry. Is the motion back? Is the motion loaded, Madam Clerk? Okay. Motion is loaded. Councilman Richardson's motion substitute members. Please go and cast your votes on the motion.Motion carries.Motion carries. Thank you. And with that, we're going to go ahead and go to the next item, Madam Clerk.\nSummary:", "answer": "WITHDRAWN\r\nRecommendation to declare ordinance amending the Long Beach Municipal Code by adding Chapter 21.66; and by repealing Chapter 5.89, all relating to Medical Marijuana; declaring the urgency thereof and declaring that this ordinance shall take effect immediately, read and adopted as read.  (Citywide)"}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThank you. We're going to be moving on to the regular agenda. Now, one councilmember has to leave a little bit early tonight. There's been a request to move one of the items up. So we'll be carrying item number 13 and then going into public comment.Item 13 Communication from Vice Mayor Richardson, Councilwoman Gonzalez, Councilwoman Mongo, Councilman Andrew's recommendation to request city manager to evaluate new and ongoing revenue sources and make the necessary preparations to restore Paramedic Rescue 12 in January 2017. Further request City Manager to evaluate and report back to the City Council the feasibility of a short term and long termplan for additional public safety restorations within 90 days.Thank you. So as this is my item and I made the motion, I'll go ahead and speak first. Mayor Garcia had to step out. So first, I want to thank my COSIGNERS for signing on Councilwoman Gonzalez, Mongeau and Andrews, as well as all the council members who have expressed an interest over the years in placing a greaterfocus on public safety. I also want to thank the residents and the leaders who are out here tonight for coming out this evening and joining us the week of Thanksgiving. This is important and I'm great. I'm glad to see this turnout.Our public safety personnel serves more than more than 500,000 people. 5 million, 5 million visitors a year protects 55 square miles of our city, the busiest, busiest port in the West Coast and the airport. In fact, the fire department, emergency responders, some of the busiest per capita in California.Rescue 12 was eliminated in FBI 2011 budget during do due to the great great recession. That's almost seven years ago. And since since it's being eliminated, calls for service have increased by 16 and a half percent, according the fire department's presentation to the city.The increase in call volumes with elimination of resources has created the worst response times in our department's history. We are we are currently only meeting national average response times 44% of the time. Beginning in 2010, the Long Beach Fire Department had to continually restructure its its deployment strategy due to budget cuts.And since then, the number of calls have continued to grow. Response times have increased. Safety of our residents is being compromised. For example, the average of all emergency response times in 2005 was 5 minutes and 29 seconds, with 72.8% of calls.Meeting Response Standards. Ten years later, in 2015, the average of all emergency response times was 6 minutes and 16 seconds, with only 46.1% of the calls meeting standards. And that's just unacceptable. So for too long, we've been forced to cut rather than invest.And even as the local economy has improved, we were unable to bring back critical services that we need to maintain a vibrant world class city. This year, local leaders asked residents to step up and make investments in our city and county through adopting a number of new revenue sources.And because they all passed, our general fund will see benefits from new revenue opportunities. And now's the time to invest in quality public services that our residents need and deserve. We've already started to bring back some of those services we've lost due to the Great Recession, and past budget cuts will soon see those police departments south divisionrestored with new police officers. We're seeing we've seen the fire department's Belmont Shore Station restored with Engine eight. These investments are all important because they help us work toward a safe and long, safer Long Beach. The way to improve response times, to add resources and people to respond to 911 calls for service.Remember, Rescue 12 is a benefit to the entire city, not just north Long Beach. Restoring Rescue 12 will help reduce response times throughout the city by helping other rescues in their respective areas, rather than have to wait for units to become available from across town.But now's the time to do even more. We need to push for a full restoration of public safety services and new strategy, direct to direct services to the areas of greatest need. It's time to restore Paramedic Rescue 12 by adding a ninth paramedic in the system.We can be better assured that when there's an emergency, help will be on its way faster. Additionally, evaluating the responsibility of the feasibility of long a short term plan for further restorations will ensure a path to a safer Long Beach.The public's trust is in us, and I'm committed to doing all I can to work toward a safer, more equitable city. And so I strongly encourage my colleagues to approve this motion, which does two things. It calls on the city manager to specifically take steps to to reduce, restore rescue 12 at the beginning of the year, basedon the prior list set forth by our fire chief. And it allows us to further explore of public safety restorations with our police department to establish some sort of a plan to implement them. We, we, we when we want to see some balance here, we know that needs are not just in the fire department, but also inthe police department. So as we, you know, further implement the fire chiefs priority list, we want to talk with and engage with our police chief about his priority list and see additional additional restorations on the PD side as well in the fleet in the future.I want to I want to recognize that Restoring Rescue 12 also puts us on a path to further restorations in the fire department. There is if we stick to the fire chiefs restoration once 12 is out of the way, you have a path to engine 17, which I know is very important to Councilmember Darrell Super now andsome of the folks in central and east Long Beach but tonight is about 12 and our paramedic services that that have not yet been restored. So my question for city staff. Mr. City Manager, how would you respond to this request tonight?Mayor. Council members will be coming back with a report that provides the financial information to the city council can make decisions to begin those restorations, whether it's fire restorations and or police restoration. So we'll have a financial plan that the city council will then make decisions on how it's going to be funded and what it's going tocost.Thank you. And so that concludes my remarks. And that's my motion. Thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez.Yes, I think in light of many of the funding sources that we will see come down to us as we receive more information on what those projections will look like, I am supportive of this item because that was the rescue.12 was the next immediate item on the priority list. And I think it is only fair that we respond to that and make sure that we're not only responding to rescue 12, but I assume, like Councilmember Rex Richardson said, that we will have an overall discussion on public safety and what those priorities will look like with bothpolice and fire and even with our Marine and harbor area as well. I think that's very important. And so I wholeheartedly support this item. I think what we've done in South Division and in eight in Belmont Shore has been incredible.I look forward to seeing more and thank you both for being here as well.Thank you, Councilmember Superman.Thank you. I would like to ask for a friendly amendment. And that would be to add engine 17 to the language here. So Rescue 12 and Engine 17 are considered simultaneously. I've spoken at council on a couple of occasions expressing the need for Engine 17, how critical it is.So I'll take a little different approach tonight. If we look at the project management, management model of cost schedule quality. I think the cost has been well established that it's 2.2 million to restore Engine 17. Measure A gives this $48 million a year.So you think if you divide that in third place, fire and public works, that's 16 million. So that's 2.2 million out of that 16 million for for fire. So if we add up, let's say all of the if we take that restoration of engine eight, the second fire academy at 1.3, four, 4 million.Rescue 12 and Engine 17, I get a grand total that is only 43 and a half percent of that 16 million. I believe that is feasible cost wise if we go to schedule. I believe Chief Tory told us the last time he spoke here that he can restore this engine company immediately and schedule.When you talk about fire is it's unique in a couple of ways. It's one of the few resources that can be restored immediately. And secondly, you never know when that need is going to be. We're entering the winter season and just ironically, I believe, the duplex that burnt down across the street from Station 17 that took placein January. If we want to talk about the third item and that is quality, I've spoken of that before here and that is I think I talked about how the calling areas, the areas of the city, 17 calls on a but several other engine companies and I think it affects five different council districts.So I'll just talk about 17 specifically. They cover the four or five freeway from Lakewood Boulevard to approximately Bellflower Boulevard, and that works in tandem with Engine 22. So if there's a fire or crash on the freeway, Engine 17 would approach from Lakewood Boulevard heading south, and 22 Wood would head north from Palo Verde.And the reason that's critical to have these two engine companies work in tandem is when you get a report of a crash on the freeway, sometimes they don't know what side of the freeway it's on. And so they can kind of approach from both directions.Also, if you think of I haven't talked before about the number of structures in Engine 17 area, some actually multiple, multiple story buildings. The Holiday Inn at Lakewood and Willow comes to mind. Community Hospital near the traffic circle is in Seventeen's area.I talked about council districts five and three. I think Park Estates probably has the largest number of wood shingle roofs per capita than any other neighborhood in the city. So for those reasons, I'm asking my colleagues to support a friendly amendment or extra Vice Mayor Richardson and approve us moving forward with Rescue 12 and Engine 17.Thank you. Thank you. And I'll I'll I'll certainly take it in advisement. Here's what I would here's what I would say I admire and I know how important that engine is. And so we just restored an engine in East Long Beach, engine eight.The paramedics, we haven't yet. The fire chief is, you know, run data back in the day. And then we asked them to rerun the data a year ago after the elimination R&D about his priorities. And they came back the exact same priority list as they were back in 2011.So it came back that the priority list was Rescue 12, then Engine 17, and then I believe it was 1 to 1 and they can speak to that. But tonight is really not about like we didn't dogpile engine eight and say we need everything else at that time.We supported it everything in the order. And I'm I'm willing to add to my motion to ask staff to evaluate the feasibility of of of engine 17 or provide some sort of a timeline for 17. But this motion and I don't want to diminish that this is really about paramedic services and communities waited seven years so thatthat would be my response and I hope I hope that a suture request.Councilwoman Price.Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and thank you to my colleagues who brought this item. This is definitely a priority and one that I support wholeheartedly. And I know that we as a council, all of us want to see police and fire services restored, and we've been working on this for some time.So I really appreciate Councilman Richardson bringing this forward. I'm also very supportive of Councilman super nice, friendly and would hope that you would consider bringing accepting it. I can't speak for him, but it sounds to me like he's basically trying to say, can we can we find a path for both, is what I think he's trying tosay rather than one over the other. But we actually have an item on the public safety agenda that was filed in, I believe it was in October. Our meeting got canceled because of one of the members not being able to be there.But we do have an item that's on file and it is asking it's similar. It's asking for the city staff to take a look at measure a revenue sources and look at our public safety priorities so that we as a council can talk about whether or not we want to reallocate the priorities that we have set underMeasure A and this is a discussion that we had at the budget cycle, and I believe it's very consistent with the logic that Councilman Supernova just articulated a few minutes ago, and that is we have $48 million that we can reasonably anticipate receiving as a revenue source related to Measure A, and perhaps we need to reevaluate stillwithin the guidelines of public safety and infrastructure where we're going to be allocating that money. We are facing some challenges in the city, as Councilman Rich or Vice Mayor Richardson has mentioned, that are new and different. And every day we are challenged with more public safety challenges that our police and fire departments are not equipped to handlein the manner that they should. We're not meeting the standards, and and that's certainly something that we want to improve upon. So I support this this motion completely, especially with the friendly. I do expect that will provide a report to the full council after we have our public safety meeting.And we're already planning on preparing a written report for my council colleagues so that we can hopefully have a broader discussion as a as a body in terms of measure a money and how we may want to allocate that money within the different public safety and or infrastructure categories.So thank you again for bringing this. And the more resources that we can allocate to public safety, I think the better off we'll be as a city. So thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.Thank you. I'm a big supporter of ensuring that our neighbors have the most safe and most safe environment. I appreciate that. Councilmember Richardson and I worked strongly on this back before the budget, and there does have to be a path one at a time.I think we are all on board. That 17 is next. And I hope that within the context of the report, at least we could get a timeline on what that might look like. If that's a possibility, I think that that's a strong indicator to the community that will help us make those decisions for the next rounds ofmeasure funding that we have coming down the pipe. So with that, I appreciate and we'll support the motion.Thank you. Councilmember Everingham.Thank you, Mayor. I to support this motion. I think that we have a plan. When we passed Measure eight, we said that we're going to be looking at all of our public safety deployments and where we need and and restoration while the other stations and the units that we were missing or had taken away because of ourculture and the economy. So I'm very supportive of this measure. And I think that if we are to be successful and we are to be within our budget, we need to stick to the plan that we set it initially and let's stick to it.So I will be supporting the original motion.Thank you, Councilmember Supernova.You know, I talked about stats and whatnot just a minute ago, and I'd like to go to the intangibles. I think by definition, that's not quantifiable. That's usually not the area I quote. But I'd just like to make one other point about Station 17 and the lack of an engine company in that house.To say that it's next to the training center is kind of an understatement. It's it's on the same prop property, basically. And this is what all of our recruits see as a working station in our city. And you think of that recruit class that we're paying, you're spending $110 million on.If there are 20 recruits there, that's $67,000 per recruit. I would like those recruits to be really enthused about working in the city of Long Beach to see that this city supports a fire station with a fire engine in it.I would like to see that we spend that money and they don't go to another agency after they've received the training here. And I think it's just a critical piece, as I said, morale, whatnot. Those are the intangibles.But I think this is the display. This fire station is a display for every one of our recruits to see working next to the training center. And that's just another reason why I think we need Engine 17 in place there.I if if my friendly is not going to be accepted, I'll go a different course. Thank you.Thank you. I'm going to go to Councilman Pearce. I'll make a few comments and make it a public comment and we'll go back to council. Councilman Pearce.Thank you. I think it's great that we're, you know, have this item in front of us that we're looking at restoration again. I think during the budget process, we talked about having this come back in January and doing everything we could do to restore fire.I think that there are a lot of questions that I still have. So forgive me for going through a little bit of a process. So I have that the priority list is 17 one, two, one. Is that correct?I know our police chief is in here about 12, 17, 12, 17, one, two, one. And it's my understanding that those, as Daryl said, could be turned on immediately. Should we take a vote to restore all of those today?We could restore those.I'll turn that over to our deputy chiefs. We have Deputy Chief Chris Roe and Jim Rex McCool. Many are members of the council. My name is Jim Erickson, assistant chief of operations.As far as turning them on tomorrow, that would be a possibility. Yes, we can absolutely do that.Do we have the staff to if we turn them on, say, tomorrow or January 1st to staff all of those?The way we do our constant staffing, we would we would use overtime for that and until the recruit class graduated. But as far as staffing them, we would staff them. Yes, ma'am.Okay. And my concern is representing a majority of downtown, as we just supported a you know, one of the tallest buildings that we're going to have in downtown. Is that the response times that council, that vice mayor mentioned, 46% meeting standards.That's to the door. That's not to the 35th floor. That's not all the way up. And so how are we making sure that we're covering our downtown constituents and also we're leaving our firefighters and paramedics to impact the areas and get out to their folks as quickly as possible.So it's I'm supportive of restoring 12 because we said that we were going to do that and we said we were going to do that during the budget cycle. My expectation is that when we talk about that second part, which is staff coming back in 90 days about what it would mean that we're having a conversation aboutall the email money, all the funds that are coming in and really being able to act quickly to restore to restore as fast as possible, and that our fire would be able to do that. When it comes to restoring PD, I know that there are restorations that need to be made citywide, and particularly on the West Sideand North Side, but also wanting to have that conversation be something that is rooted in an equity lens, that it's not just about more PD on the ground, but it's about supporting things like data and some of the projects that they're doing in New York.And how are we policing in a way that's consistent with our values as a city? So if we bring that back, I just don't want it to be a report about what does restoration look like? That was there before, but I would want to have a fuller discussion about it.So I don't know. Vice Mayor, if you have any comments on that, I just. Okay.Vice Mayor Richardson.Sure. I just want to be able to respond more directly to Councilmember Supernormal. So so I don't think I was maybe I wasn't clear before. I didn't think that it was necessary to do an accept or a rejection of the motion.I express support that. I think the motion says go ahead and, you know, explore, evaluate further restorations. I'm not saying we depart from the Chiefs priority list. That priority list calls for Engine 17 directly after Rescue 12. So I'm committed to that fully.And I have no problems or reservations with asking staff, Hey, if they find the ability to do more than rescue 12, great. I'm not saying limited. Well, I'm going to wait till councilmember spinoff is. So what? I just want to be clear.I'm not saying if staff comes back and says we can restore engine 817 101. Go for it, by all means. But the fire chiefs priority list for going on seven years, which is where you spent about a year ago, has come back and said the priority list is the priority list.And that has not changed. And I support that completely. But I think thank all the council members for their comments tonight.I'm going to make a couple comments, make a public comment, and then I'll go back to the to the actually, if the other two councilmembers want to jump back in. I think that's fine as well, obviously. Just just a couple of things.I think first is I do want to just start off by thanking, obviously, Vice Mayor Richardson, that you've been advocating for this for a very long time. And so I appreciate that in the community we've seen out here multiple times on this very issue.So thank you. A couple of things I think are important. Just in just to note, it is always been certainly my intention and I think the council's intention to be able to make more restorations on public safety side beyond the first two that were made in the first year.The budget that was passed part of of Measure A was obviously focused on a large public works program, which is beginning, which we're very excited about, but also making public safety restorations. And we've made the first two. We're very excited about those two.In addition to that, I think having this discussion around 12 is the next part of the restoration, as is the discussion that Councilman Supernova's bringing up when it comes to 17 as well as other public safety needs. So what I also am hoping for is a couple of things, I think.One, I think it's I think it's very appropriate. It's clear from the chief that rescue 12 is the next the next priority of a restoration. But it's also clear that 17 is the next priority of the chief after after that rescue.And so it is obviously important for us to begin that process of looking at 12, but also right following up behind 12 is 17. And so staff should also begin that preparation of looking at those numbers and seeing what the cost is and and how would it be able to do that or not do that?But I think we need to have that discussion. And so I am supportive of the process to begin looking at 17, I think, Councilman Shoop, when I think that's appropriate. But I also obviously I know that 12 is the next priority and I think that's got to be dealt with first.In addition to that, I think we need to here in these, you know, then when staff comes back, I think that is going to be an appropriate time to have a council discussion about what are the next priorities of both the fire department and the police department long term?What does all the revenue that's coming in mean for the city? And also what does the revenue mean when it comes to Measure eight? I just want to remind everyone, measure is not a permanent tax. So any restoration that is not public public infrastructure, we have to figure out how to pay long term because what we arenot going to do and what I will not support is making a bunch of restorations and then cutting those and cutting all of those apparatus across the city. So I think the the approach that the council is taking is very smart, which is easing into the restorations while the economy is growing, while incredible projects are being developedand built across the city. So that from a fiscal point of view, we're being both we're both listening to the community and doing the right thing, which is making restorations. And by the way, once we restore Rescue 12, we're going to continue to restore more public safety, hopefully restorations.And I think that's a conversation this council supports and wants to have. But I just also caution is that we have to be able to figure out and have a plan on how to pay for these long term, which and we're talking about these next five years and then the ten years.And so that is, I think, needs to be part of this, a greater, larger discussion when we have it in a couple of months or whenever you bring it back. Mr. West. I think what everyone said here has absolute merit.I think Councilwoman Price has been very clear about her interests here, and I appreciate that. And we should discuss those. We should be discussing 17, should be discussing all the needs, but also talk about what what do we really have in terms of dollars?When will those dollars disappear and at what rate is the economy moving to be able to cover some of these expenses long term? So I just wanted to make those comments. I am supportive of moving forward on 12.So that's the next restoration, but also to begin to look at 17 because that clearly should be the restoration that we that we focus on beyond beyond 12. And so I hope that's where we end the motion ends up, is that we can find some sort of compromise to do that.Let me go back to the to the council, and then I'm going to go to public comment. Councilmember Soprano.Okay. I'd just like to clarify something here. There seems to be some language that I'm somehow deviating from the chief's recommendation. I am not. I am in lockstep with what the chief has recommended. All I'm saying is that we came out with the restoration of Engine eight and a fire academy.Those are two items. So I'm saying, okay, now the chief is recommending in order rescue 12 and engine 17. Who says we have to stop it? Why not? Item we did two items before. So let's get both of these items restored tonight.That's my point. I'm not deviating from anyone's list, but I didn't hear the chief say, Oh, you can only restore these one at a time. That's my rule. That did not happen. So I'm saying let's restore both tonight.If we're going to come back with a report, the dollars are here. It's in black and white right now. I don't know what the report is going to tell us later that we don't know tonight. So I would like to move forward with this item.I would like the friendly accepted that we're going to add engine 17 to the rescue 12 restoration. Thank you.Thank you. And to clarify, Vice Mayor, I don't think you're asking for any restorations tonight, is that correct? Okay. Just want to make sure that clarify that as well. Okay. Let's go to the public and then we'll. Okay, let's go to the public.And then after we'll come back to the council. So if you have a comment, please come forward and 3 minutes, state your name.Good evening, Councilman and Mayor. My name is Eileen, and I live on Saint Francis in the ninth district. And I come before you to voice his support for Rescue 12. We have a number of seniors living alone in my neighborhood, and I know there's in other areas as well.But it's we have been without a rescue 12 or a rescue truck for quite a number a number of years now. And we have had to rely on other districts for that kind of service. And it's very important.Some of my neighbors have had to wait for quite a while before some have shown up, except maybe for the engine to show up. In fact, yesterday I was out doing some of business and as I came home was approaching the street where I turned to go home.Here had been a head on collision right at the street where I was going to have to turn. The only vehicle there to support the accident was a police car. No paramedics. Nobody else was there. And as I came around the corner and it was the car was sitting right there, it was obvious that somebody had hitthe windshield. And I would have liked to have had somebody there to to help. And so. It wasn't until I got home, which is several blocks away, that I finally heard the fire department start to come. Because we have we live I live close to a hospital.So I hear those kind of sirens a lot. So I recognized what it was. So I want to encourage you to support this consideration and for listening to me. And thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson and Councilmember Gonzalez and Mungo and Andrews for going along with him.Thank you.Thank you, Counsel. I'm sorry. I'm actually next for the speaker. I apologize for that. Yes, sir.Good evening, Mayor and council members. I'm getting over a call right now, so if I sound kind of funny, it's because of that. I'm in favor of the I'm Phillips. I'm here and I've been a resident of Nord Long Beach for about 50 years and I'm also on the board of the Uptown Business District.I'm in favor of this. And North Long Beach has has a significant amount of industrial properties in their area and which is the equivalent of high rise. But I think the industrial has stands more of a chance of of injuries than than something of that wood type wood.The. 90805 zip code. Is roughly the size of Bellflower or Paramount or Lakewood. And all of these cities have rescue units that they have or they have contracted with someone to provide the service for them. When Fire Station 12 was was built, it was designed to be an emergency response center for the area.And I would assume that being an emergency response unit, that they would have a paramedic there. On a more personal note, I am personally in favor of it because both me and my neighbors have used the service in the past, and I've had a daughter that when she was having a babysitter over there, had a had convulsions. And we found out later that the paramedics came there and brought her back. Also, my wife walking the dog fell and broke her hip and she was couldn't get up. And by the time I got it and got the word and got there, the paramedics were there and helping her and they were putting her on a boardand taking her to the hospital. So I appreciate the help that they provided. And I would think it's your duty to return this service to to to North Palm Beach. It's a great city. And I think North Lawn, which deserves it.Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker.Please.Good evening, Mr. Mayor, Vice Mayor, city council members and staff. My name is Margaret Dudley and I live in the ninth district and I'm here to support the restoration. The full restoration of paramedics, rescue 12 in my district is long overdue.It's been on you guys agenda since 2010, I believe. And I fully support Chief Tory's priority and having this paramedic restored. And as my my neighbors in my community in the ninth District, we were very concerned about not having this paramedic in our district.But as you said, Supernormal, we live in the city, the whole of Long Beach, and that's going to be a priority.To have.Rescue 17 fire in 17 there. So I just urge the city manager and to go ahead when these funds come in for measure in May that you you restore you fully restore and fund rescue paramedic rescue 12. And I thank you for hearing me and I hope that you all have a wonderful Thanksgiving and a safe holiday. And to my citizens, my residents of North Long Beach. Thank you all for hearing me. And please restore paramedic rescue 12. Thank you.Thank you so much. Hello.Good afternoon. Afternoon. Glad to see you again. See the honorable mayor and Vice Mayor Rex Richardson to all of the city council representatives. I'm here. My name is Linda Wilson, and I'm a resident in the ninth district in North Long Beach.And I live in the College Square Neighborhood Association area, and I've lived there for over 20 years. I do also I am also one of the community, I guess, activists or community representatives in my area. And while I empathize and feel for what Councilmember Boehner is saying about 17, I just want to remind everyone that our priorityhere tonight is 12. We've waited a very long time for 12. We've talked about it for years. We've agonized over it for years. We've waited and we've waited and waited for a rescue that was taken away from us.And so this is just a restore of something that was taken away. And that's what we're looking forward to. We appreciate the fact that you're preparing this fiscally sound plan, responsible plan and planning on money that you know you're going to get.And then priorities down the line, addresses additional funds that may come in. But we need stability. We need the assurances we need to bank on money and revenue that is actually planned for allocate it and that we expect mightily to present itself.And so tonight. We're really pleading with you, restore 12. Let me just share a quick story with you. If you could imagine closing your eyes for 3 minutes. Or 5 minutes would even be longer. And I say those time frames because my husband.One night did not respond to me. And I called for paramedics. And I waited and I tried to call him and tell him, don't leave me. I shook him. I tried to breathe for him. I remembered I needed to unlock the door.And so I ran to the front and unlocked the door. Then I needed and came back to him waiting. It hurt. No sirens. I prepared. I said, okay, well, I need some clothes on. So this was in the middle of the night waiting?Nothing. Nothing. It took a very long time. It took 5 minutes. That was an agonizing 5 minutes for paramedics to come. And had we had 12, it would not have taken that long. So tonight, I just want to leave that with you as you consider and as the city manager actually takes a look at the money andall of you give your considerations. 12 We need. Thank you. Go Long Beach.Go Long Beach and go uptown.That's why I love you. Next. Bigger us. Go uptown. That's right.And good evening again. My name's Greenspan, homeowner in the ninth district. And as most of you know, the ninth District is the most populated this district in the city. We don't have access to medical centers, urgent care center.So this rescue 12 would act as a go between. And it actually is a no brainer. I mean, we have new development coming. We have new interests in the north district, which is always on the short end of the stick.Some of these other areas you have Long Beach Memorial St Mary's and we can go on and on. But you know, at the Long Beach we rely on the rescue. Well, not only the service, but because the new station has actually increased our home values, which.Causes us to pay more taxes, to generate, you know, the service. So it's a no brainer to restore the service in an area that is so.Populated with.Young people under 18 years old. And again, thank you, Mayor Rex Richardson, for your due diligence and have a good night.Thank you. Last for the comment.Very good. You, Clark, is the address. I obviously support the restoration of all the fire department equipment and resources and particularly with the council. And so, again, I said that there's no reason why we can't do it all.I would, though, once again to point out. That we would not be having this discussion. Had you not? Put the city on the road to bankruptcy by the new city hall. And you had that job. You still had that opportunity, as I outlined earlier, to recapture that some of that money by replacing by building the city halldown on Ocean Boulevard. I fully support also the art and the concept which you talked about, where it's not limited to the fire department says, but restoring the integrity of the police paradigm. And particularly restoring what has been dismantled by the disease, the mindset that now prevails, i.e., destroying, dismantling the neighborhood watch program.I don't know if you're aware of this or not. But if you're one of your neighbors called. And didn't reference. It's the house that had been broken into. There were a home invasion. Was yours? And they were raping or assaulting your family members.The response out of the the disease policy from our. Dispatchers are. Well, that's not your residence. We have to have the owner call period. That is the standing de facto de jury policy of the city of Long Beach.That is disease and demented thinking. We don't need to spend dollar one to change that. We just need to fire the people that put that in place, period. Somebody. Earlier this evening pointed out a glance, another classic example of that.They had reported that a neighbor's wall had been severely damaged. Somebody had driven into it. Teetering on falling over to a public area. The response out of the disease dispatch center. You're not the owner. You have to have the owner call.You don't need to reconvene the Council of Trent to change that. But I think what we're going to have to do is change. A number of people within the police department. Hopefully we'll be able to retain Chief Luna, who's been ill served, as I said, and I'm going to address that a little later that evening.Thank you.Thank you.Kate, we're going to go ahead now and go back to the council for a vote. Vice Mayor Richardson.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I just want to thank the speakers who came down. You made really compelling points. And it hadn't even occurred to me that we opened our new fire station in 2013, and it hasn't had a rescue once since.It's been since I've been there. We had the R&D situation, but that was a full rescue. We haven't had a rescue since that structure is open. So that's. So thank you for acknowledging that and for recognize that moment and and for all of you coming down and speaking.And I want to just I want to I want to get the city manager or the city attorney just to restate the motion for me so I can be clear, so we can be clear on what it does include.Okay. Well I'll I'll restated. It's the motion as is the motion as written. I want to accommodate I want to make sure that we do acknowledge and accommodate what Councilman Supernova is saying about, you know, making sure that if we have the ability evaluate, if we have the ability to restore 17 as well as one on one, then put us in a position to do that immediately. So not. So this isn't saying if we, you know, come back with just one plan for 12. Yes. We're not deviating from the chief's plan. But if we have the ability to do further restorations, put us in a position for the council to do so.So does that. Councilman Hooper not is that satisfy your sentiment, Councilmember Pearce? That satisfy your sentiment? Okay. So that said, I want to go ahead and call for a vote and urge my colleagues to support this. Thank you.Okay. There's a motion on the floor. Please cast your votes.Motion carries.Great. Thank you all very much. We're going to go ahead and now go on to public comment. I'm going to let let me name the first few speakers. First up, the first three, please lineup Larry Goodhue, Zo Nicholson and Steve Updike.\nSummary:", "answer": "Recommendation to request City Manager to evaluate new and ongoing revenue sources, and make the necessary preparations to restore Paramedic Rescue 12 in January 2017, according to the Fire Chief's restoration priority list;\r\n\r\nFurther request City Manager to evaluate and report back to the City Council the feasibility of a short term and long term plan for additional public safety restorations within 90 days."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nMadam Secretary, please put the first item on our screens. And Councilmember Hines, go ahead with your comments on resolution 392.I thank you, President Pro Tem. And because I called or I deferred this last week, I want to provide a little context as to why I deferred it. And just on its face, this program checks so many boxes.I have been a huge advocate for multimodal transit and breaking Denver's dependance on cars for a long time. And this provides mass transit options for people who choose not to own cars and for people who cannot afford cars.It provides a more environmentally resilient way to get around our city, including shuttle service bikes and micromobility. What's even better is the solution is all electric. So shifting away from internal combustion engines is another critical step to ensuring we preserve our habitability on our planet.Finally, we'll be fine with climate change. It is our own habitability that we are destroying. What I didn't see in the contract in the in the original language was accessibility. And I believe that our our city should serve all residents, not those who are easy to serve.And I had two concerns. One is the electric shuttle accessible to people with disabilities. And two, is the electric vehicle charging station accessible to people with disabilities. I didn't have answers to the questions like last week, but I've now received responses to both questions.I want to thank Mr. Salisbury and Director Rink of Kazu. I want to also thank the organizing committee, including Ms.. Haines, specifically for your responses and and Ms.. Haines for for specifically mentioning excessive ride in your comments during public comment.So my first question was, is the electric shuttle wheelchair accessible? And I am happy to say that the answer is yes. The Montreal Organizing Committee did say we are deeply committed to pursuing options that improve transportation accessibility through this grant, particularly when it comes to the electric shuttle.We are very interested in pursuing a vehicle option that is wheelchair accessible since many of our community members and program participants are disabled or have mobility needs. Again, as Ms.. Hands had mentioned, excessive ride. As as wonderful a program it is and as liberating it is as it is for people with disabilities.It only has it can only provide so much. So I want to thank the Mandela Organizing Committee for calling that out and making that a value and a priority. The second question that I had was regarding the electric vehicle charging station.And and I want to thank Keyser again. The response was that the. The new parking lot for this building has ADR spaces is required by law, one of which will have access to an EV charging station. I think this is this is also interesting and critical.And and it is it needs the law as it is today. This is something that I think is is important to talk about because we civil rights is about equal access for everyone, including in this case, people with disabilities.With this charging station, it has two, two ports. It's a dual charger. One is in an accessible parking space. About 10 to 12% of Colorado drivers qualify for a disability parking placard or plate. And in this situation or in this configuration, 50% of the spaces are reserved for people with disabilities.That that that isn't in the spirit of of ADA or in the spirit of civil rights. That's nothing that that the organizing committee has any power or purview over. I would say that that we are looking into that as a city to try to figure out how to best provide access for people with disabilities and access foreveryone else so that it is all equal access. So, so while I recognize that the commitment that the organizing committee has and, and Kaiser has to, to providing access for everyone, I see this as an opportunity for us to make our, um, our access to ev charging stations even better.And I hope that we can continue to move forward in that direction in the future. Thank you. One more time for answering all my questions and I will be yes. Vote.Thank you. That concludes the items to be called out. The bills for introduction are ordered published.

So good evening. I'm Debbie Potter. I'm the city's base for youth and community development director. And I'm also here with Lisa Fitz, the management analyst from the Housing Authority who works on this issue with the city. So hopefully between the two of us, we can answer any questions you might have.Member Ashcraft.Do you do you want to go ahead and just for the audience, explain briefly what this fears about.So the city has an annual well, we have an affordable.Could you back and forth. Describe the item for the audience. Let's do that.This is a consent calendar item every year because of the type of fee this is, we are required to file an annual report with the City Council reporting on the amount of money we took into this dedicated fund, the amount of money that was expended and for what the monies were expended.This is our affordable housing unit fee. It is our impact fee that we charge to commercial development that is covered under the fee to mitigate their impacts on affordable housing. So this is the annual report we're asking the council to adopt this evening.Thank you.Member Ashcroft And so I have no problem with levying the fee and collecting it. What concerns me is we had an ending fund balance of $144,609. And the and there's certainly a breakdown in Exhibit One of the expenditures, but and there's certain specified uses that can be made of these fees they include, but are not limited topre-development or development loans to develop affordable housing grants, to develop affordable housing participation leases. Other public private partnerships, and they may be used may be expended for the benefit of rental or owner occupied housing. And I just wondered, in a time when we've seen so much need for housing in our city, were there not some other sourceswhere I would prefer not to see a six figure balance sitting there? Unless you're going to tell us that maybe it's more prudent to let it get up to a certain number and then a certain amount, and then you can do more with it.But now that was my question and concerns.So we this is a fund that fluctuates a lot because you can have a lot. When Alameda Landing was under construction, we had a lot of money coming in and we spent that money very actively and very aggressively in two years where we don't have a lot of commercial development, we don't have that much money coming in. So it does have sort of a lot of peaks and valleys. So when looking at doing more, larger projects, we look to, as, you know, one of our revenue funds that have a more steady flow of income. This fund, we tend to do special studies, special projects and administrative costs tend to be what we do because wecan't really rely on this fund to be consistently the same amount of money every year.Okay. Well, maybe it's and I'm prepared to vote to approve this report now, but perhaps in the coming year and years, we can talk about if there's other pressing needs that might be that these funds might be applied toward.Because, again, we've seen what a housing crisis we're experiencing in Alameda in the the whole Bay area. But thank you for your explanation.Thank you.Do you have emotion.So moved.A second.All those in favor. I emotion carries unanimously. Thank you. That completes our consent calendar.

Seawall Repair Phase two project for a total contract amount not to exceed 15,685,900 for District three.Thank you. Let's begin by turning this over to our staff. So, Mr. Modica.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Members of the Council. So tonight before you is a pretty significant project. We wanted to give you a very quick update on. So the Naples Sea, I think a lot of us have been down to Naples.It's a beautiful part of town. And we walk around those seawalls and most people don't recognize that those are actually public walkways. So those are not part of people's houses. Those are the public domain, which is why it's such an open, inviting area to go down to.And so we've been assessing those Naples Sea walls over the last several years, and they're in need of repair. There's seven different fit or six different phases, and two of them have been the most critically identified as really in need of repair, specifically for seismic and for other types of of degradation.And so in 2009, we started this effort and identified the issues. We did our six total plans, and then we actually completed phase one in 2015. And so we're here to talk about phase two. The scope of work is we really need to protect homes.It's on the left side. As we protect our existing infrastructure and homes, we then demolish what's there already and then we create a new walkway and a new seawall that goes along with it. So phase two is a little bit different than phase one.The project actually is not one single area of the canal. In fact, it's three separate landmasses. It's a little bit bigger than phase one. It's another 240 feet. And it's more complicated because the sheet piles have to go down 4.4 and a half feet to accommodate those rougher waters.There's 60 concrete piles that support larger docks, and there's two new pump stations as part of the project. And so this is a more complex project, a larger project, and it's about 17.9 million total funded out of Thailand.So these are not funds that are general funds that could go to streets and roads. It's all out of the tidelands. So you get a sense of where the site is. So we're looking at Treasure Island and the entrance to the Naples Canal is where we would be doing the work.That's the next vulnerable part. So a lot of what we're trying to do is to replicate what we did from phase one. So we learned a lot from the community outreach and a lot of the technical issues there.But we did learn some things from phase one, specifically about the utility conduits, about some of the desires of the residents to plant some technical issues with our access platforms and also our pile caps and some of the some of the issues to make sure people aren't just sitting out there in a dangerous condition.So for construction timelines, we're really excited to be here in front of you today. So summer 2019, we would go out and start working with homeowners and do all the project submittals that are necessary and site preparation. We then would start the project in early 2020 when you install those huge sheet piles and push them down intothe water. And then 2021 and fall would we would have substantial completion. So tonight before you is a recommendation to adopt the plans and specs. It's about a contract of $13 million with a 13% contingency. And with that, we're available for questions.Well, thank you. Great presentation. I want to turn this over to Councilwoman Price first.Thank you to our staff one for working so hard and learning the expertize on this project, but two for conducting so much community outreach on this. Many people don't know that the first phase involved a whole construction scheme that was different than anything that we had done before, given the materials that we were using and the typeof construction that was required. And so we've had to utilize a lot of lessons learned from the first phase to make phase two be efficient and cost effective as best as we can. So I appreciate the the expertize that's been developed by our Tidelands team to make this happen.I'm also very mindful that as we look towards our climate adaptation plan and talking about our climate adaptation challenges in the future, making sure that our sea walls are structurally sound is a very important component for all of our all.Of the.Coastal communities throughout the state, but especially, of course, here in Long Beach. I do want to thank the residents. I'm not sure how many of the residents are here, how you guys, they really have worked very hard on this project, attending monthly meetings for years, especially.Maureen Poe is here. She really has been a champion for the entire neighborhood in making sure that she advocates for the residents in regards to this particular project. This project is really important to the city because every year, especially around Christmas time, tens of thousands of people come to Naples to visit the area, to enjoy the sights. And we need to be able to provide an environment that is safe and a public walkway that is structurally sound. So I'm very grateful for the work that's been done on this. And I want to thank the residents who are here.I also want to say, I know that we're we're still talking about some of the aspects of the project that will need to be fine tuned and based on.Cost to further.Identified. And I think if we can have consistency to the extent possible with phase one in terms of the railings, that will be very important, even though it may not be as cost effective as going with a different type of railing.I want to make sure that we have consistency and are paying attention to the esthetic needs of the community in that regard. So with that, I want to thank our staff for being involved and helping with this project.Councilor Pearce. I just want to add a few comments. First, I just want to thank staff as well. I think a lot of folks don't realize how important of an infrastructure project are or Master Seawalls project actually is.The first phase was incredibly complex, but we also, like Councilman Price said, learned a lot. And I think the Tidelands team did a great job of working with the community and the project. Beyond being a large project within our Tidelands is also it's just a massive infrastructure project and also a public safety project.We have to ensure that the seawalls are are not just strong, but are also protecting not just the property, including including the cities, but the people that come to visit Naples and that are walking through the canals every single day.The other thing I wanted to add is I will I just want to to our staff. I, I had communicated a little bit with Councilman Price today, and I agree also the issue on the railings and the the fence or the railings, whatever you want to call it, I've had some communication with some folks that live there. And I think that the consistency I know while there is a difference in in price, I think it's important that we keep the consistency the same. And so I just want to make sure that we continue that we have a commitment from staff that we are going to look to ensure that that happens to the best ofour ability.Mr. MODICA Yeah, so we absolutely agree that it would be nice to have consistency. We really like the design. It has to do with whether it's a horizontal fence or a vertical fence, as we've been working on this project and costs have been kind of creeping up on us as they do with every every cost, the costof every project, the cost of steel. First and foremost, we wanted to make sure we got all of the project done because the safety came first. But we would really like to find solutions to get back to that original fence.So the project is bid actually has the vertical fence in it. Our plan is halfway through the project. We're going to see how we do and if we can make the change order and get that upgraded fence, we would love to do that.So it's about a half million dollar change order. We're open to that and we'll just do the best to make sure we don't run into any problems. And then we hope that will work out quite well.And just it's not just I understand that. And so I'm I'm glad that we're going to hopefully commit to doing that because it's not just about what we're installing. It's a completely esthetic change to where currently is there.And so I think to go from one kind of traditional classic look that we've had to then completely change that I think would be not consistent with just the look of, of the whole neighborhood. So I just want to make sure that we're as committed to that as possible.Please.We are very committed.Thank you. And and so with that, obviously very supportive of this project. Is there any public comment on the Seawalls project? And seeing members. Please go ahead. And Castro votes.Motion carries.Okay. Thank you. And we are going to hear the other. We have another item 25.

Recommendation to authorize City Manager to execute all documents necessary for the Second Amendment to project labor agreement and execute a new citywide project. Labor agreement for all covered projects over 750,000 and also street related right of way project over 1 million citywide.Thank you. Let's go and take it to the staff.Thank you, Mr. Mayor, members of the council. We're excited to be here tonight. We put a lot of good negotiation into a project labor agreement, and we're happy to bring this back after getting some good direction from the council in October and really working through a number of things to make our play even stronger.So I will turn that over to John Keisler and Nick Schulz for the presentation.Thank you, Tom. An honorable mayor and members of the city council. Happy to present to you the the details behind the new project labor agreement. So just as a quick background, back in 2015, the council authorized the original play.That agreement funded projects over 500,000. It ran for five years and it required certain things like the jobs coordinator for only projects over a certain amount that was extended by the city council last year so that we could negotiate a new agreement.As you also remember, on October 13th, we actually conducted a study session to get feedback from the city council and hear about the city council priorities. As you, as you recall, the independent jobs coordinator, new definitions for for our workers and who would be eligible for the program and new requirements for holding our contractors accountable for theprogram goals. Another important aspect that the Council highlighted was how can we use our project labor agreement to create good jobs for disadvantaged communities and include goals from our framework for racial reconciliation? I'm happy to report tonight that this new agreement really does hit on all those priorities and that the Council brought forward at the study sessionand really grateful for our partners at the trades, members of the community that have really provided a lot of input. And this really does establish a ten year agreement that prioritizes our residents, those that have the most challenges, and adds the independent jobs coordinator for all projects to support them in finding and keeping jobs.This new agreement also substantially adds more eligible projects. In fact, in the last play, we covered about $50 million worth of projects. This one will cover almost a quarter billion dollars over $260 million worth of projects that are projected by our public works department over the next five years.This also expands the definition of disadvantaged workers, adds the accountability that the council had prioritized. And to do this, we also increased the thresholds for projects so that we can cover the costs of these additional support programs, address some of the bidding issues we had encountered in the last play, and provide stability longer and bigger projects forour workers so that they have more continuity in their in their jobs. So just as a quick summary of the specific terms and conditions that the trades and and that our team, Nick Schultz hammered out, this is actually doubles the term from five years to ten years effective on the execution by both parties and covers all projectsover $750,000 for street related or right of way projects over $1,000,000. And what we'll be doing is we'll be coming back after five years when we get our new project list to talk with the trades about a cost escalation factor based on year six and through ten.This also the trades have agreed to place referrals from the city in their apprenticeship program. They've also agreed to prioritize local workers on local jobs no matter where they were on the priority hiring list. And it requires the independent jobs coordinator to support all projects no matter their size.Union membership is not required for our residents and workers to participate in the play. And disadvantage workers now have a range of of different categories, including veteran chronic employment, homeless, single parent, criminal record, all of the same categories that the Metro play requires up in Los Angeles.Also, we're expanding our reporting to record disadvantaged work hours by city and tier so that we can better identify if local workers are benefiting from the program. And we're implementing a program on our side to hold our contractors accountable for these hiring goals that the Council has set.In terms of cost, this really will cover 40 to 50 projects over this next five year period. I have to call out Eric Lopez, our public works director, who has been really working closely, closely with us in really being an advocate for how we can make expand the number of projects in total budget.Those 40, 50 to 50 projects over the next five years are projected to be $266 million. That's a five times increase from our last. And we anticipate for the new programs that we talked about around independent jobs, coordination and reporting that it will be about 1% to 2% of the total project cost depending on the size ofthe project. That is a total of roughly 2.6 million to 5.3 million over the five year period for the total package. There's only one thing that I have to add to this presentation, which is an A. The recommendations should be approved as written except for the following amendment.And I have this up on the screen. It's in the the second recommendation that the language should read beginning after five years from the effective date of this agreement, the parties shall meet and discuss potential changes to these thresholds with any agreement reached to be put in writing and signed by the City and Building Trades Council.So with that, I will end my report and I'm happy with here with Nick Schulz, who really was at the forefront of negotiating this agreement to answer any questions you might have. Thank you so much.Thank you. Mr. Murdoch, did you have any additional comments?Just that I am really happy with the work that was done. I think we've seen a lot of great projects getting done through our project labor agreement over the past five years. We've employed a lot of people. We've reported on all of that progress and the last time that we did this and we're going to keep trackingit and looking about prioritizing jobs going forward. This also is part of our reconciliation work. As the council passed, the reconciliation plan was to really look at how do we do additional jobs, especially in areas that haven't had access to jobs.And that's what the jobs coordinator is going to do. So with that, we're turn it back to the council for questions.Well, thank you. I'm going to make a few comment and then turn it over to Councilmember Ringa who made the motion. Let me let me just begin broadly by saying that I'm really proud that Long Beach has really led the way in the creation of its original city wide project labor agreement.It was not it was done, obviously, with a lot of pain that went into it getting there. And I remember first being on the council when we were having these discussions and the resistance that we ran into as council members and certainly even even some resistance are when all of us came off this body together, a lotof folks that were still learning about what these project labor agreements were really all about from the community. But we got it done and we signed really one of the most substantial city wide agreements in the state of the agreement.It was a partnership with our construction trades, with all of our building trades that do such amazing work across our city, who build our city every single day. And I want to just thank each and every one of them, especially Ron Miller, who has carried who's been our go to leader on that end, but really all theheads of all the trades and the members. And I just want to also note that our work on this place and of course, the work that's happening now as we extend our wasn't just about what happened here in Long Beach, but we took this energy and began to work then with the port to ensure that they hada play. And then pretty soon Long Beach City College moved forward and they put a project labor agreement in place. And then recently the school district moved forward and put their project labor agreement in place. So we we made this not just about our public projects, our large infrastructure projects.We created a system where all project public projects across the city, across jurisdiction, would be ensured to have these level of good jobs. And we know that these projects come in and they come in in great shape. They're done by skilled labor.There's community benefits. There's apprenticeship programs. And they're done with the quality that we expect and within the budget parameters that we put in place. And so it's been it's been a home run for us, really proud to be here again for this extension.And I want to thank all the members that have been so supportive of our project labor agreement work. And so with that, we have a motion and first step is councilmember uranium.Thank you, Mayor. And if you can please put up a Slide seven. Think it's the one that I will be referring to. I want to agree totally with everything that the mayor said when I was on the committee, college board trustees.There was an effort also to create a play when I was on that board and there was resistance as well as during the time that Councilmember Ranga was on the city council to try to bring this forward. And there was also resistance in those days.So this is a major threshold that we're crossing at this point. You can put up Slide seven that. Anyway, the the whole issue is that it is community based. We are still doing a remarkable job of working with our community, our affiliates with Ron Miller and the construction and trades with all the other unions.And we're also dealing with this long before the legal foundation, I'll tell you, the teachers Liberal Lobbyist Mediation Project and many other community groups and leaders who also put a lot of work into this project. The most important parts of the project, obviously, I guess I'm able to fly there, is that it provides the Metro's definition ofa disadvantage worker, and it also includes in their the city's ability to not only track these disadvantaged workers, but also find out where the cities are, what period you're in. And also, I think the most important part of it is that it holds our contractors accountable for local, for meeting local, and it's valid, charitable.I think that's one of the most important aspects of this project labor agreement. And as mayor said, it also provides a guarantee that the work that gets done in the city, in Long Beach and that well is done with codes and that with the the knowledge that there are going to be fair wages and living wages forworkers in this project. So I'm very happy and pleased toward this motion forward. And we appreciate the unanimous endorsement supported by council. Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember. Next up is Councilwoman Cindy.Thank you, Mayor. I just want to.Give.A huge congratulations to city staff to council member Rhode Island for all the hard work throughout the year that has been done in advocating for our local construction trade jobs. I know it's been really great to be able to see, you know, this this presentation and see how much work has been put into it.I'm really excited because this this agreement actually brings so many good paying jobs to so many residents in need, especially right now. We're going to need so much of this. So I am looking forward to supporting this item.And again, congratulations on this.Thank you. Council member Austin.Thank you. Obviously, this item has my full support. I want to congratulate and just salute staff for negotiating a great agreement with the the building trades and the interest. I love the fact that many of the points raised by the community over the years, as we have learned over the last five years with the play of howto tweak it, our, our, our, our recommendations to to look at the Metro agreement, it looks like we're we're fully implement kit and agreed upon in this this agreement and that I think will help with equity but but ensure that that a as a member already mentioned that we have quality labor peace and quality projects in ourcity expands it to many other public works jobs that that we currently do now which I think is good. Local hiring is is extremely, extremely important. And I just want to just mention how far we've come. You know, over the last five years, I can remember, you know, the very first meeting when Patrick O'Donnell was the originalauthor to to move the project labor agreement forward. I was a coauthor on that had matriculated it brought came back with you know Gonzales so much work and effort has come in over the years but it did start off very rocky and with a lot of uncertainty and uneasiness.And today I think we it's a 180 degrees. The relationship with the building trades over the last five years and the results that the original play has produced are commendable and something that we can build upon. And so I'm looking forward to supporting this item and putting people to work over the next several years.Thank you.Thank you. Council member I'm sorry. Vice Mayor Richardson is next.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. This is certainly a monumental, monumental achievement for a Long Beach. The last play represented about $2 billion in work. This new play tonight represents more than $260 million more significantly. That's five times the impact on this honest play.It's five times the opportunity. Most of the jobs are coming to our local community, and that's largely by expanding to include street projects. And my colleagues are right. This has been refined. I want to lift up Councilmember Turanga, who's really been a voice and advocate for this since his time at LBC.Standing up for, you know, construction, local training and jobs. So I think it's appropriate that, you know, that he made this motion tonight. And I know he's got a tremendous like going to try to do it. I remember when I was a chief of staff, Steve Meal Break Appalachian Gerry ships Detroit.It's been a long history and it wasn't really until I think 2014 when all of us joined the city council that the support, the votes were there to really make this happen. I'm glad to see that the four high level community needs have been addressed in here.Shout out to the Long Beach local hire coalition and Long Beach Ministers Alliance. They fought for eight years to get this right. These these recommendations were not new. They advocated for these. When we began begin this conversation. They were advocating for these these these four measures.And it's great to see that it's been negotiated. Thank you to the L.A. Building Trades Council and city staff for making sure that these provisions are there. I also want to acknowledge the work of the Long Beach Racial Group Racial Equity and Reconciliation Initiative, specifically calling out the opportunity to ensure that the construction workforce reflects our localcommunity. That's important. So the four pieces, the independent jobs coordinator, I'm glad to see this. They're utilizing strategies from the equity toolkit that's important to ensure that black workers, brown workers from our local communities of color can work on these projects.I'm glad to see the definition of disadvantaged work targeting the most to need. You know, I've said it before, we have a k-shaped recovery disadvantage, workers taking a lot longer to recover. So we have to align all of our strategies, including the play with that effort on reporting disadvantage, work hours.Incredibly important. Talked about this and glad to see that in there. And I love that we have a process to move the metro, hold contractors accountable. That's the view of all these things together has brought brought us to this point.So this is a big moment for the community. It's a big moment for jobs, the big moment for labor. It's a big moment, moment for language. And it's all about the recovery. So so thanks a lot. And I'm happy to support this motion.Thank you, Councilwoman Allen. Councilwoman Allen.Not going too well. Sorry about that. Yes, I'm sorry about that. I was still on mute. Yes. Thank you, Mayor. And I'm just really excited that we're at a good point and that everyone is happy. And I know that it always hasn't been this way in the past, but so much good work has been put into this. And I have heard from several of our partners and this is a good package. Local hires. Goals are being met and the play has mechanisms to ensure a good faith effort by contractors, which is good. It encourages hiring of disadvantaged workers and implements independent job coordinator and also covers our street and gas line projects that weren't coveredin the past. But most importantly, like my colleagues have already talked about, it establishes a ten year agreement that prioritizes Long Beach residents on the hiring list. And this is important for our community in a time where, you know, we need these jobs.So I do want to thank John Keiser and Nick Schultz and Eric Lopez for their work on this play and for all of our partners and trade. And I also want to acknowledge my colleague, Councilman Roberto Ranga, for his history and advocating for our local construction trades since his time on the council.So great work, everyone, and I'm excited to pass this tonight.Thank you, Councilman Allen. Councilwoman Pryce.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Can you hear me okay?Yes. No problem.Okay. Thank you very much. I do want to acknowledge the great work of staff of getting us to this point. And I know that during the conversations tonight, we've talked a lot about, you know, initial resistance to this.And I'm not sure exactly what specific conduct or words folks are recalling, but I do. Just like Councilman Austin, I do remember when this item came forth, I believe we were having our meeting offsite at the Highland Park Community Center when we first discussed this topic.And I think, you know, I was one of the council members that really was concerned about the additional cost of the project, because that was a community concern that would city projects now take on an additional cost. So I don't know that I would necessarily call that resistance, but I was really grateful at the time because themakers of the motion did accept some of the friendlies that I made that resulted in us having more transparency and regular reporting than we would normally have on citywide projects, which allowed us to be able to demonstrate to the constituents the best use of the public funds that we were using for these projects, which of course, isis the number one concern for all of us with the fiduciary duty to to make sure that we're getting the best price for projects. One thing that I have learned over the years is as several of the projects in my district and along the coastline have been completed with the play, they've been tremendously successful projects.And while there may be an additional cost associated with the terms of a play, that cost is is far outweighed by the benefits of utilizing a play. What I have been able to determine and speak of as fact from my own personal opinion as a result of some of the report back requirements that were part of thefriendly amendment that we adopted five years ago, actually seven years ago, was that six years ago, on balance, the additional costs of the yielded in projects that are consistent in terms of the work quality and the quality of the final product, the efficiencies that have been identified as a result of working of the play, our efficiencies thatwe would not have without a play. And I think overall having some consistency and also at the same time putting quality Long Beach and regional workers on our city projects has far outweighed any additional costs that would come with the projects.And in my experience, the projects that I've been involved in have all come in under budget. So I feel very confident. I'm grateful that we had a robust dialog that was critical of some of the the concerns because we were able to demonstrate through the data that the play is actually a beneficial opportunity for the city interms of executing city wide projects. And I'm grateful for John Keisler and Nick Schulz for putting the work that they put into place tonight, but also in the consistent reporting that was adopted as part of this provision in 2015.So I fully support this project and I look forward to having more city wide projects that can be completed through a play. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Mongo.Thank you. I want to thank so many members of our community who have continued to stand up for the community needs. I remember the dialog as well and at the time I was really modeling my goals after the Metro contract.It was the only conference that I was pretty familiar with and in meeting with elected officials that had passed a play and they really felt it was the gold standard. And here we are today. I'm able to mirror some of those things today, so I want to appreciate Labor for their work over the last five years.They've done excellent projects that I don't think would have been possible without the coordinated collaboration between our staff, the unions and the bid winners. And then I also want to thank our city staff. It has not been an easy path.It is a lot of additional work and we know that you're taking it on and taking it very seriously has led to amazing community impacts for individuals who might not otherwise have a job. And when you talk to someone who has had an opportunity because of the building trades and the confidence they have and how you canhear in their voice that their life has changed, you can tell that these agreements are really more than just jobs. They're really life. They're life for a family. They're breadwinners, they're community members that are able to have a living wage and also feel competent about how they can be a productive member of the community by contributing totheir family. And so I just want to thank everyone who's worked with me over the past several years. I had a lot to learn about plays, and I think that now as a member of a council that's really I'm leading with with partnership, I'm really proud to be here.Thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman. Next up is Councilman Ringo.Thank you very much. I haven't had a chance to speak yet. I don't know if you're kind of going back.Yeah, I have your next. Sorry about that. Let me, let me. Let me. Let me, actually. What am I going to cancel in sorrow. And then I'll go to Castleman sorrow.Thank you. Sorry about that. I thought. Councilmember, you and I have spoken already, but I just want to make sure that to thank everyone who has been involved to getting it to this version, I know that it's taken a lot of conversations and work.And so I think John Kaiser Mitchell and Eric Lopez and their staff are getting it working so hard. And also our community organizers and advocates who have also made sure that we got all these different pieces together particularly.So just making sure I know that it's going to help, you know, contribute to increasing equity in my district. And I especially think it's a bit important that we incorporate the Metro's play definition of disadvantage workers and getting independent jobs coordinator.And it's going to be so crucial to ensuring that we get people in my district back to work and improving the livelihoods in their family as well. And also, I just want to echo to what Councilwoman Allen shared about again, referring back to Councilmember Urunga, as, you know, making this motion and his leadership and not only havinghis expertize around plays and labor and workforce development to the council, but also at bringing it from his past work as a LPC trustee. So I'm very supportive of this item and happy to support it. Thank you.Thank you. And now Councilmember Ringo.Thank you, Mayor. And I want to express my gratitude to all my colleagues for their very positive thoughts on this project here and the project legal agreement. It's been a long time coming. It's been a labor of love for many of us.And it's a culmination of a lot of blood, sweat and tears volunteers in bringing this forward. But one last thing, if I can. I'd like to see if we can have an annual review as to how we're doing with our place in our hiring efforts so that we can keep track of what we're doing here.And with that, a motion to approve the project agreement. Okay.Can we take public comment, please?Our first speakers, Abraham Zavala. Abraham Zavala.Hello? Yes. Yes. Please begin. Okay. Hello, everybody. This is Lopez speaking on behalf of Abraham that I couldn't make it. Representing Libra. Hello, Honorable Mayor and City Council. Thank you so much for digging. And also thank you for taking step forward and doing what's right, right.And protecting and ensuring that workers here locally get jobs. And hopefully with the new steps, we can ensure that local Long Beach residents are the ones taking up these local jobs with good benefits and the entry way to also union jobs that will ensure, you know, and ensure that we continue to grow middle class.So you can offer an opportunity to recreate and regrow a middle class to low income, marginalized residents who at times are, you know, put to the side, whether it's a criminal record or any other thing that is, you know, not allowing them to get a job.And, you know, we're offering opportunities here. So as a Long Beach resident, I'm really excited to see this forward. Really happy to see this as a tenant advocate, you know, to be able to offer, you know, opportunity for people who, like I said, get marginalized.And as we take that forward towards equity, you know, we're headed in the right direction. So, once again, thank you so much. And as a member of the of the coalition, you know, we support this and are really thankful for everyone who's taking a stab at this.Thank you.I think your next speaker is Chris Hannon.Chris Hannan. Hello. Good evening. Honorable mayor, honorable city council members. This is Chris Hannan, representative for the Los Angeles Orange County's Building Construction Trades Council. The city of Long Beach is the project. Labor agreement has created opportunities for so many, with 235,000 work hours that were created or that were worked constructing those projects for the residents ofLong Beach, the impact was much greater. And I'd like to echo some of the comments that were made earlier. The impact and example the city of Long Beach said is just so much bigger than that. The individuals that were taken in through the Long Beach City College's apprenticeship readiness program.That was created because of the city of Long Beach's Project Labor Agreement. Those individuals are now over the same period of time working between 680 to 850000 work hours for that same five year period of time. It's led to other project labor agreements and community workforce agreements in the area.When I was at the Long Beach Unified School District's meeting, as well as the Long Beach City College's meetings for their project labor agreements, there were individuals that started their careers because of the city of Long Beach. This play.And it's just incredible the impact that it's made on their lives. And now they're working not just on those Long Beach projects, but in and around the region. And bringing those dollars back to their communities along the Pacific Gateways has done a great job supporting and removing barriers for these for these candidates as they entered into apprenticeship. And now many of them are even completing their apprenticeships and our journey level workers within our local unions. So the new ten year agreement is just going to create an expansion of those opportunities. And on behalf of the Building Trades Council and our local union affiliates and apprenticeship programs, we support the approval of item number 20.And want to thank all of you for the partnership. Thank you.I think your next speaker is Elsa tung.Hi. Good evening, Honorable Mayor and City Council. My name is Elsa Tung from Long Beach Forward, a member of the Long Beach Local Hire Coalition, which is a community based coalition that has been fighting for years for local and disadvantaged hire.Best practices within the city wide project labor agreement to benefit our Long Beach neighbors most in need. Today we say thank you. Thank you so much to economic development director John Keisler to city staff and to our council champions.Thank you for listening and with your vote today, thank you for doing right by our community. The proposed new plea includes the four structural improvements that have been consistently recommended by the local higher coalition to strengthen local disadvantage.Tire number one require an independent jobs coordinator for all projects to define disadvantaged worker using Metro's definition, which targets the most economically and socially disadvantaged population. Three Report Disadvantaged work hours by city or tier. So we know if Long Beach residents are benefiting and for use Metro's process for holding contractors liable for local and disadvantaged hiring goals. Council members recall that under the original 2015 plea, only an average of 19% of work hours were performed by Long Beach workers, with a majority of work hours coming from outside Long Beach. With these four structural changes, we should see this balance tips back toward Long Beach workers, and specifically the Long Beach workers who are most structurallydisadvantaged. Finally, I want to read out loud the equity lens section of the staff report, because this is the city's promise that everyone needs to hear, quote, exploring and enhancing the role of the independent jobs coordinator in the proposed plan to improve access to local jobs for black communities and communities of color was explicitly called for asan action item in the strategy for Advancing Economic Equity in the city's Racial Equity and Reconciliation Initiative. Report to advance the strategy, the play administrator in the Economic Development Department will develop an implementation plan using strategies from the Equity Toolkit to enhance the role of the Independent Jobs Coordinator in the recruitment, training and ongoing support of blackworkers and local communities of color for work on play projects. Now, to keep track of this promise over the next ten years of the agreement, the play should be brought back to council regularly for official review and evaluation council members.We find ourselves in one of the worst health, economic and racial injustice crises this city has ever seen. But with your leadership, we will have a brighter future. Thank you so much for your leadership today. Thank you.I think your next speaker is Jessie. I'll call her.Yeah. Well, also the council on all council. Mayor, my name is Jessie Alcala. I am a single father of five daughters. I live in the city of Long Beach. And the one thing I want to thank the city council for is creating this program that focuses on disadvantaged workers like myself.I am a single parent raising five girls all on my own. And this opportunity that I believe that can program, that can provide. Well to make a huge impact on my life and many lives. Long Beach residents. So what we would like to do is to have a strong commitment from the Honorable Council to stay focused onhiring locals as an active tenant leader in the housing. Just a moment. I want to call on council to remember that your jobs can lead to more stable housing for families like myself and my residents around. Thank you for your time.Thank your next speaker, Suzanne Brown.Yeah.Good evening. My name is Suzanne Brown, and I'm an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles in our Long Beach office. I'm speaking this evening on behalf of the Long Beach Local Hire Coalition. Our coalition came together eight years ago to fight for strong, local and disadvantaged hiring requirements in the city's play.We strongly support plays and all the benefits of good paying union jobs, which is why the local and disadvantaged hiring pieces are so important to us. While it has taken some time to get the local and disadvantaged hiring provisions right, the recommendations in the staff report reflect what the community has been fighting for since the Coalition wasformed eight years ago. We want to acknowledge this progress. We strongly support the adoption of a new play for ten years, with the four additional provisions laid out in the staff report, which you've heard restated many times, requiring an independent third party jobs coordinator for all play projects, utilizing Metro's definition of disadvantaged worker reporting, disadvantage, work hoursby city or tier, and using Metro's process for holding contractors liable. These additional provisions will bring languages play into alignment with best practices by our partners in the region, such as L.A. Metro, and they will result in more jobs for Long Beach residents at a time when jobs are desperately needed.With the devastating and unequal impacts of the COVID 19 pandemic, we must seize opportunities to assist with a more equitable recovery. The play is one such opportunity and it was identified as such in the reconciliation initiative. We want to especially thank Councilmember Urunga and Vice Mayor Richardson for the leadership on this item.They have been working alongside us for years now. We also want to thank John Keisler and his team for working with us to create a play that includes the community's priorities. Thank you.I think your next speaker is coming off of a.Bob. President.Yes, good evening. Mayor and city council some provide here. You know, I just wanted to mention that, you know, ever since this project global agreement was in place five, six years ago, you know, thanks to the city mayor and.And the city council for taking on the adoption of the plea. You know, we know it was, you know, hard negotiations between the building trades, Roger Miller and Ray and and and the city staff at the time. But, you know, we we always experience these type of project labor agreements that come across a renewal process.And I don't think there's not one project labor agreement that has not been renewed since the project labor agreements have been in place for for many, many years. So, you know, I just want to echo the mayor's comments when he mentioned earlier about, you know, the city of Long Beach taking on, you know, throughout the city departmentsand the different agencies in the city of Long Beach that have adopted project agreements. Thank you to you, Mayor, for, you know, being the advocate that you are and the city council, you know, being advocates as well to the to the other agencies within the city.You know, and I think, you know, the city of Long Beach, you know, you know, take their hats off and say, hey, you know what? You're the you're basically the only city that has done this, I think, in all California, when it comes to having all the different agencies within the city of Long Beach adopt a projectlabor agreement. And I think the top probably three or four cities that have adopted a ten year agreement, you know, within L.A. County. So, you know, this is you know, this this day is a historical day, especially moving forward with the infrastructure dollars that the city is looking forward to in the near future.We look forward to working closely with the city of Long Beach and making sure that these project improvements, you know, keep keep moving and in making sure that we keep ourselves accountable. I want to thank the city staff, Nick and John and Public Works director for negotiating this contract.You know, these contracts and you know, they're not easy, but, you know, you guys got it done. And, you know, he'll be out tonight getting this applicants approved. So thank you. Thank you very much. And we look forward to working closely with the city and then.Thank you.That concludes public comment for this item.Mayor. That concludes public comment.Customer Ringa before we go to the depot or I'm sorry you made a motion. I just want to confirm that that includes the the revisions the staff discussed.Yes, it does. And I also think in the annual review of the progress.Yes, we we definitely we definitely got that and then I have so that's the motion to have the second by councilman's in Dallas and councilman price.Tamara, just real quickly, I wanted to just highlight a couple of things as as my colleagues were talking. It occurred to me that this conversation regarding plays has been going on far before, even when I was on the council and councilman Councilman Ranga highlighting that former Councilwoman Ranga had also brought this issue before council and that hehimself had brought it with City College as a reminder that this is a lot of conversation. Then when I was involved in this through this council, and so there probably has been a lot of historical procedures with resistance and concerns and things in the past that I'm not even aware of.But I do. I would be remiss if I didn't call out specifically now Assemblymember O'Donnell and Senator Gonzales. Assemblymember O'Donnell is the one who brought that item forth at that first meeting that I think lasted until one or 2 a.m. at Highland Park, where we first talked about this issue.And he was really passionate about the topic and did a lot to educate me. And I know some of my other colleagues on why he felt passionately about it. And when he went on to the assembly, Senator Gonzalez really took the lead on this as well.And so, Councilmember Ranga, thank you for your efforts on this and for reminding us of how long this discussion has actually been happening, that it even predated you on this body, but that you had initiated on the College Board as well.So I really appreciate that. But I didn't want the night to go by without acknowledging some of our former colleagues who contributed so much to this conversation. So thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman. There is a motion and a second roll call. Vote, please.District one. I district to. I think District three, I District four.All right.District five. District five. I. Can you hear me?

An update to the counties development regulations regarding wineries, breweries and distilleries will take public comment on this item.We have 25 people signed up to testify. I will ask you to limit your testimony to one minute each, and when I call your name, I'll try to call about three people at a time. You're welcome to approach either podium.The same rules apply that applied earlier to not campaign for or against any one or any ballot measure and to avoid obscene speech.

And we'll begin with Susan, Bernie Sanders, Ryan Ervin and Dominique Jorgensen.Shall I go ahead and start?Yes, go ahead.I'm Susan Bounty Sanders. My remarks today should be taken as those of me individually, not in my role as one big city council members. I want to thank you for the fixes so far in Councilmember Bell due to strike.That's presented today, but I urge you to go farther in your fixes. The goal, as I see it, is to preserve irreplaceable agricultural land and to honor the Growth Management Act and to make that that urban growth boundary as bright a line as possible, rather than eroding the urban growth boundary.Wherever you see someone or interact with a landowner that you like, rather than making.Your.Decisions based on the public policy questions and the specific fixes that I would ask for are first, eliminate overlay. A second, sharpen up the definition of winery so that it is not prone to abuse. And third, I remove the provisions that grandfather people who are currently in violation.These problems still leave the door open for land speculation and environmental degradation, and that's why I'm asking for their removal. Thank you very much.You have your own Ron Irving of Fashion Winery, and I'm here to support the amendment to the ordinance. And I'll make it short. I wanted to tell you some of my background and I maybe have enough time, but there are a couple of great exceptions and I worked on both of them.The Pike Place Market is historic district from the city of Seattle, Seattle, and work with the Pike Development Authority and also in 1976, the Save the Farm Lands. And both of those have been really critical too, to us.Vachon is very unique and right now we're struggling with people coming over because it is so unique. And and I think that I hope that you can see that and making an exception will work and it'll keep me in business.Thank you.Thank you. And following don't Dominique will be then it's but it's going below. Melissa Earle and Cliff Otis.This striker is still terrible. We should all be ashamed of King County, of how bad, how corrupt, how inept and discriminatory our whole system is, especially permitting businesses like ours have been claimed as being harmful to the environment.You know, King County's lack of good infrastructure has left billions of gallons of raw sewage dumping into Puget Sound over the last three years alone, yet were the ones that are claimed to be damaging the environment. We don't have good infrastructure, period.Yet you're pushing for rural businesses to go into urban where you can't even support who is already there. I am so ashamed of our county and flabbergasted that it can be so blatantly hypocritical. I honestly believe if Dr. Martin Luther King were here today, he would be ashamed to have his name associated with this county.We all have a dream. We won't be able to live equally, be successful, and be able to enjoy family, friends and life itself. Well, this is not a dream. This is a nightmare. And King County has nobody to blame but themselves for the issues we have today.Issues like this are exactly what people hate. King County. We're the worst county in supporting agriculture, local business and residents. We have no accountability. We have no recourse. We are wrong and we have no recourse. When permitting doesn't follow their own code as WDM or even state law, the current Stryker breaks multiple state laws now, sir, tobe completely thrown out the window. You want accountability from the people. How do you start with the government? Have accountability first, this ordinance initiated from a study that represented only 0.0 1% of the entire unincorporated areas, yet then will blanket the other completely unrepresented 99.99%.Do you realize how ridiculous this doesn't results from such a minuscule area to affect everyone else. This would be like conducting a random medical drug study where after one person the results are in. So let's not take it to the rest of the population.Thank you. And I recognize that people perhaps came with expecting a longer amount of time to testify. If you have written testimony, by all means you can provide it to our clerk and copies will be made and distributed to all of us.Good afternoon.Afternoon. My name is Dan Scrambler and I'm an owner of Horse and Brewery. Just wanted to let everyone know. Four agricultural farms throughout Kent Valley in 1882 1891, hops were planted throughout the entire valley. So we are completely agricultural businesses.But, you know, I have a real big problem with this grandfathering clause where it says, like, you have to be in compliance as of the date of the ordinance passes. Just that verbiage is against state law. And can you explain how difficult this is?We've spent over $20,000 to file a 1400 dollars permit and that it's just crazy how hard it is to get any sort of permit. When departments can't talk to each other functionally. So I just I it's really hard to make this ordinance better because it just started wrong and it really, I think it just to waste anymore time, money and effort, it should just be thrown out. And if something needs to happen, it needs to start with the fresh start. Thank you. Thank you.Hello, counsel. My name is Melissa Earl and I'm.One of the owners of Lumber House Brewery in Hobart.I'd like to state for the record that our various parties have not been notified of these swift scheduled ordinance hearings from the beginning all the way to now. We've never been notified and we've put our information down.We've been told we were going to be communicated with.And we've never been told about these. And they always end up being really quickly dropped. And most people can't take off work to come here and do public testimony with a few days notice. The most recent version is not clear on grandfathering or vesting businesses.Please make sure to review vesting state law. We do not believe that this is in compliance with state law, nor.Is.Licensing the sale of alcohol, which again is only regulated by state and federal law. This ordinance proposes that we can make but not sell our products, which I don't think that's a very successful business model for us unincorporated breweries, which in turn has forced us to move our businesses.Actually, I had to separate mine, leaving my brewery in Hobart and taking part of it to Black in the city. Yeah, I came with a two minute long speech, I guess from a show of hands. Can anybody else in this room say majority?We don't support this ordinance. It was like that last time when we came here and did public testimony and most people here said they didn't support it. And I think that today we're pretty much in the same boat.Following Mr. Harris will be Paula Waters. Brianne Ebsen in any Magrath Hello.My name's Cliff Otis. I'm the owner of MATTHEWS Winery in Woodinville. So greetings. Several of the changes that have been identified in this Stryker will have a very negative impact on our ability to run our business and sustain our winter operations at the current location.Both the new 15% tasting room limit and the parking changes have really caught us off, you know, off guard and surprise. So we're we're suggesting that you guys just take a little bit more time, because structurally this doesn't make any sense.15% of the tasting room space is not enough to run our business. And the parking, if you index that with the top, if you're having a tip for 150 people or 250 people we would have the most of at WB the two eight parking spots to be the three of 17.How are you supposed to do an event of 125 people or 250 people on eight parking spots and 17? If we don't change the parking stuff inside this to a minimum, you're going to have a mess because you're going to have people parking on arterials and side streets all over the county.And I don't think you want that. So really think through the structural pieces of this ordinance because there's some big deficiencies in it. Thank you.Thank you.Thank you. I'm Paula Waters. I'm speaking today to you also as an.Individual, not as a city council member, and wouldn't vote in 2013. I ran for city.Council specifically to protect the valley.From the threat of annexation of parcels that was.Being considered by the city, parcels in the action being considered by the city council. At that time, we were able to forestall that threat. But regrettably, the threats now of land speculation and environmental and environmental degradation will not be solved, I believe.By this legislation, but perhaps even enshrined.So I get.It. We've been looking at this for a long time.It's very hard to manage competing interests. But I just want you to know that if this legislation gets passed as it is, I will be deeply disappointed. Thank you. Good afternoon, council members. My name is Amy McGrath and I'm the executive director of the Washington Brewers Guild, which represents the state's small and independent craft breweries.There are currently 400 breweries in our state and 111 of those breweries are located here in King County. We continue to have concerns regarding the proposed ordinance requirement that breweries obtain an adult beverage business license to be issued by the county, and the state would require or the stated reason for requiring this additional licenses so that thecounty can better track these businesses operating within unincorporated King County and then provide regulation for compliance. And the state already is required to notify the county if these businesses come up for a new brewery license or a renewal.And we're also required to do monthly reporting to the state on production and taxes paid. And so it's very easy to track active licenses further where we're concerned that the requirements attached to this license go into the territory of regulating the manufacture of beer in the state, which we believe is regulated by the state and the TTBat the federal level. We're very highly regulated and are concerned about the overall reaching precedent that this could have for other local jurisdictions that would implement their own licenses and their own enforcement structure for this very important business for our state.Thank you so much for your time and work on this.Thank you. Following Brian will be Barb, Larimer, Greg, Lill and Larry Savage.Hello.I am a resident of District seven.Of unincorporated King County. I'm pretty much here just to.Do my public testimony of loving my community and loving the brewery that is walking distance for my own residents and enjoying the the kind of sanctuary of having my neighbors being able to to relax after work and kind.Of get to meet your neighbors and.Stuff like that, as well as the agricultural.Affects of it as well, like the selling of eggs. Say you want to bake a cake, you can go to your neighbor and get some eggs.And I just think it's positive. I kind of industry in our.Small neighborhoods and like bring the community together and stuff like that. Yeah, I know. Is the whole thing.Thank you.You the. Ah, Barb. Hi, I'm Barb Larimer, a longtime resident of King County, which I love and I'm attending today on behalf of Forager on Settlers. We are a Walla Walla based winery and operate three tasting rooms across the state.We've operated successfully in the Woodinville area for over six years, and our business is very dependent upon the ability to sell our product and access residents of King County. We are very pleased to see the renewed attention to this very important matter, and we thank you very much for your efforts.We respectfully request more time to review and clarify the questions concerning the latest proposed or amendment and how it impacts all of us at the wineries and tasting rooms in King County in particular, we'd like to have the opportunity to discuss some of our questions around parking requirements, event definitions and hours of operation.In general, some of us, many of us feel that the latest Stryker amendment has come together rather quickly without a lot of time for us to review and consistently provide input from all sides. And we'd like to ensure that there's sufficient time to review those prior to sending this amendment to the full council.Thanks very much.Thank you.Hello. My name is Greg Lill and I'm the owner of a family. Owns a nearly ten acre parcel of property on the Windmill Redman Road that we call our family farm and we call Chateau Lill. We have been there since the early eighties, so we are a long time resident of the area.I also helped start the Little Cellars back in 1992, which I'm still part owner of, but we have moved that business to the old red hot facility to repurpose that because we needed more space and more room and we really didn't want to take away from the great pastoral kind of setting we have at our chateau inWoodinville because of the size of our property and the grounds we've been able to offer it for our customers. Our wine customers have special events, their birthday parties, celebrations, just lovely lunches in the gazebo. It's a it's a wonderful place to be.You know, so far I've been excited to see how the county council is working together and for really trying to solve these issues that we've had. You know, but to have this all of a sudden change as of late took us all, I think, a little bit by surprise.We'd like to see this worked on a little bit longer and come to some new resolutions that will change what we see in the strike agreement. Now, we hope that this will bring about a collaboration so we can still be our farm.We have alpaca, we have sheep, we have goats on our property. And if we were to be limited and could not do our events and continue on with our winery as we use it now, it probably would lead us to have to sell the property to a real estate developer, which is, by the way, less than weall want to see. So thank you.Thank you. Is there a Larry sandwich? I'm having trouble with the handwriting will admit. Following Larry will be Delia Darby, Patrick O'Connor and Darlene Dare not seen Larry. Larry have to deliver. The lower. There is privilege. Yes, that's exactly what's written here.I see it now. My name's Larry's privilege and the property owner of the cave winery tasting room. And over the A and another property overlay. I would you know, this has been going on for us for close to three years now since this came up.And I'm just asking for a little extra time since his stroke limit came to be. We need more time to understand what it is and seems like it's very, very enforcement oriented and we don't know what the rules are.There's question zero, how certain things can be enforced. As example, the outer space is limited to 500 square feet and we have half an acre there. If someone wanders off with a glass of wine outside to 500 feet away in violation, I don't understand exactly how that's being forced to just like a little more time so wecan look at it, understand it, let you guys know how it's going to impact us so you guys can make a good decision on which way to vote.That's it. Thank you. Thanks.Hi, I'm Delaware Derby, and I'm representing the Castillo family, and I wish to acknowledge council member Val Dutchy for her recent work. But what happened to the work that was done from the Local Services Committee that was fully vetted and passed on March 11th?Out of that committee, I'm concerned that the new version language of requiring creche and for many could actually harm the APD and forcing development of industrial uses on rural land. It could negatively impact down gradient areas, and the 15% square footage and associated parking limitations are close to home occupation businesses, which are also proposed to be eliminatedthrough the ordinance and would surely eliminate the existing small businesses. Is this the goal? I thought the goal was supporting burgeoning wine businesses and protecting the APD, and I'm a proponent for both. I think there's common ground in our shared love for agricultural land.Let's meet in the middle. Let's meet in that place by supporting the the March 11th version that was fully vetted and passed out of the local services committee. As Martin Luther King stated, we can make a way out of no way.So let's not reinvent the wheel. We need to get on with the business of restoring harmony to the Sammamish Valley and to King County. Thank you.Thank you. Hope ADAMS Patrick O'Connor I'm the farm manager at MATTHEWS Winery. In the past few years, a farms in the valley, both in the APD and in the buffer area. And I'm certainly an advocate for for more food production in the Valley and the current version of the Striker.I, I don't believe will necessarily have the intended effect of supporting agriculture in the valley if it especially some of the portions that they're acquiring the the products sold necessarily be have a percentage, you know, you know, from from the area.Because honestly, like a lot of the farmers there who grow fruit and flowers and and other products do with do do do bring in produce some other areas. And it's really important to have year round sales. So. And and really tasting rooms are not the most high impact land use.So I do think there there are ways to to have ethical water use and and not be polluting the farmland and and and for the majority of of the apt in in in Woodinville there there's drainage systems where so so so most of the runoff that come from Hollywood Hills and throughout go through the bio drainage.So it is a water quality issue for the salmon. But in terms of polluting the actual farmland, that's not it's not entirely accurate. So it's been presented as such. So, um, thank you.Thank you for following. Carla will be Laura Cherry, Sarah Wolsey and Cheryl Lovatt.Hi, council members. I'm Carla Da, the guest manager for MATTHEWS Winery. And its new version is the game changer. Several of these new proposals will strangle existing businesses and rural King County, including hours. Jobs will be lost, sales tax revenue will be lost.The whole farm to table culture that we have worked so diligently to create will be lost. You are potentially destroying a place the people flock to, a place to gather with friends and family, to talk about life and to celebrate life.Please carefully think this through before implementing ordinances that would be so detrimental to these existing businesses that may result in our closing our doors to employees and visitors alike. I strongly request that you not approved the revised strike or amendment as a minimum.Please take more time to assess its impact on these businesses and the community at large. Please work with existing businesses to find a balanced solution that both preserves the rural character of the area. The store fulfills our farm to table destiny and promotes Washington wines.Thank you. Cheryl had to go.Okay, now, my name is Laura Terry, and I'm the owner of Dragon's Head Cider on Passion Island. And today I'm here to voice support for the amendment that Councilmember McDermott has proposed to the ordinance. We're part of a community of farmers and beverage producers on Passion Island.There are five wineries with tasting rooms and several others that are small producers that don't have tasting rooms. When the county began looking at ways to remedy the issues in Sammamish Valley, most of us on vacation didn't believe that any ordinance changes or recommendations to the county council would have an impact on our businesses.After all, there were no stakeholders from Fashion Island ever involved in any of the conversations with the county as they developed recommendations for the ordinance. There was no analysis done on any aspect of the businesses or community on Fashion Island.So imagine our surprise when we learned that these ordinance changes would be applied to our businesses as well. None of our businesses have ever had any of the kind of complaints, environmental or traffic issues that we hear about in this mama's valley.And when it comes to the local alcohol beverage industry, fashion island is nothing like Sammamish Valley. Wineries on Bastion Island are integral to the community on the island. They contribute to the economy, a very fragile economy, in very special ways.Our tasting room visitors and wine club members, they visit our wineries and then they go into town and they eat in the restaurants and they shop in the stores. King County needs to find better ways to support small business development on Passion Island because of our very fragile economy and not shut down existing businesses or create moredecline in the economic activity of our constrained community. Thank you.Thank you. Following server will be Bryce Yeadon, Chase Kilborn, followed by Janet Bryant.Hello. I'm Sarah Tankersley at I.Managed Police Winery on Vachon Island.There aren't more of us here today because we're getting our.Fruit in and we're.Making our beverages. But we're this is very important to us.Our company.Small. Very small. Five. Remember Wine Club? We've been around for 18 years as a cottage industry. If this ordinance passes without McDermott's proposed.Amendment, then we will have to shut down.There is no way that we can comply. There just isn't. We've been in operation for a long time. We're solid business, but there's just no way that we can do that. And when we shut down, that ripples out and.Affects.The economy of our island. It's a small ecosystem, very small. There are a limited number of businesses, and when one fails, the others fail. So I hope.That you will support Councilman McDermott's proposed amendment to Ordinance 20 1802.For one. Thank you.Chair, members of the committee Brazier Aden here today on behalf of feature wise.We'll start off by saying thank you.For the updated drafts by council member about.The issue. We think it's gone a long way in resolving most of our concerns that we've had it. It is a lot better than what we said during the last iteration and the.Last council hearing. I want to say thanks regarding the removal of demonstration area.Be including the.One acre limit on.Agricultural land. Those things are extremely important to my organization. I did want to point out a couple of things that we would like to see changed or tweaked a little bit. The first.Is allowing distilleries, these facilities, twos and threes in the rural.Area. We think a change could occur in which the majority of product could be found out of King County or the surrounding counties. And that would solve one of our issues that we have. The other one has to deal with Group B water systems.We know that three's was great.That threes.Must connect to a group A We think that that's important. We also think that that too should connect to a group as well. And I'm happy to take and help respond to any further questions after the hearing and would like to work with anybody else who.Needs further clarification of our comments.Thank you. Thank you.Hello. My name is Chase Killebrew and I work at Blue Lane, an engineering and land use planning consulting firm based in Kirkland. So we're Blue Line. I've been working with Matthew's Winery regarding proposed ordinance number 2018 0241 and helping them determine the potential effects of the proposed ordinance on their operations.Today, we would like to specifically address the draft striking amendments submitted by Council Member about Dewji ahead of today's meeting. The moment seems to contain a few conflicting standards for the newly defined Winery Brewery Distillery. Use this so we are seeking clarification for the WB, D2 and WB D3 users than the A&R reasons.Onsite tasting retail sales would only be allowed to occupy 15% employed area of the WB facility if a WB D2 is built to its maximum, a building size of 3500 square feet and only 525 square feet of the building would be allowed to be occupied by tasting rental sales.This would essentially make it with the new proposed parking standards the only minimum of five parking stalls required and the maximum allowed would be eight parking stalls. This number seems especially low and consider in conjunction with the proposed event standards with a temporary use permit, WPT to facilities would be allowed to host an event with a maximumof 125 guests. And, you know, it's just like they would have to either provide the parking on site or through a managed parking plan. And so that just doesn't seem to be feasible at this time. And then also the with only allowed 15% of the floor area to be dedicated to tasting retail sales.It's just like how would they be able to accommodate up to 125 guests? We just believes that with the maximum building size, maximum permitted service and setbacks, some of these might, such as a proposed parking standard and the tasting and retail sales space for minimum are just redundant.So we just we appreciate your guys effort and we hope that some of these things can be clarified before it's passed. Thank you.Janet will be followed by Mike Michael Tomasky, Barbara Lao and Serena Glover.Hi. I'm Janet Bryan with the State Winery. Once again, I'd like to thank the council for sharing an incredible amount of information and input on this issue. The issues are complex, and each of us in this room has a different have different interests and desires.Our cave B tasting room is an overlay we learned of the new Stryker last week and are still working to understand all the details as it applies to tasting rooms. I'm here asking that you give us a little more time to fully review and comment on the newest proposal.After learning of the Stryker last week, I attended the town meeting in Warrenville last Wednesday evening. A lot of information about unincorporated King County was provided, and during the question and answer period I became concerned about the permitting piece as it might apply to our tasting room.I would ask that the new tasting room regulations, when they become final, that they so that the information associated with those with that is made available to us clearly, so that we know our expectations and limitations. We want to comply and avoid violation.The concern is that without clearly understood definitions, mistakes happen and our business wants to continue in its current location. We want to get along with our neighbors, comply with the rules, and sell our products. We need to know the details and definitions of what's expected of us so we can be successful.Anyway, I'll just cut it short to say that we continue to be a family friendly business. We're quiet. We have. We've always operated within the recommended business hours that are now within the proposal. And this winery proposal has been a challenging one for all of us.And we thank you all for your hard work and continuing to listen to all the stakeholders.Thank you. Hello, I'm Michael Tankersley. And over a quarter century ago, when I moved into the rural area of King County, no knowing nothing about most of these issues. But at that time, wineries, breweries, distilleries were not legal in the rural area at all.And so 20 years ago and we worked and supported the ordinances that began to allow these here, we did think this was a great idea and the vision was boutique wineries. Obviously, there's a bunch of limitations on how big these could be for reasons you and I tend to go into here.We had a vision of that and we supported it. Perhaps we opened a Pandora's box in the first time because you know that this seems to be a bit of a mess. However, I think there's some things we agree on.20 year old ordinance needs some upgrading for sure. And also we really need to get past this issue. There's so many things we all need to work on. This is a deeply flawed ordinance still, and I think it's sad that you guys were saddled with this.The way it was written from executive in the first place was and such a surprise. Goodell and his staff have been really good on most of these issues. You guys were handed a real bad piece of ordinance and it's really gotten only more complex.The fact that it's so hard for you to understand is kind of evidence right up front that this is deeply flawed. It should be simplified, clarified, and the loopholes should be removed from it. That let us stick with the original vision of Yes, we can have boutique wineries in the rural area without compromising our neighborhoods, our farmlandsand and keeping the urban sprawl from spreading across rural King County. So I hope we can stretch out this suddenly very accelerated schedule on this a little bit. But hopefully we can also get past it because there's lots of other things we need to work on in the rural areas as well as your urban areas.Thank you. Thank you.Ha. Hi, my name is Barbara Lyall and I'm a surface water hydrologist and a representative from Climate Reality. And this latest version of the ordinance still does not protect our farms or rural areas from environmental degradation in land speculation on Friday, people around the world will be striking because of the climate emergency.You'll be asked on September 25th a vote for a climate emergency in King County and the farmers in Sammamish Valley are really feeling it. The corn, the squash crop failed this year because of blossom timing versus bees versus versus whether this corn was grown on Harvey's land, which I gave Claudia before last year.It's still delicious. But he grows his corn right below a grassy slope where 200 cars park on every event. That grass slope has car grease, oil, all that stuff going on onto his property, into the soil, into the sammamish valley, sammamish river where our orcas depend on it.You need to strengthen our environmental protections and stop the degradation that the wine industry is providing here. And they don't need their support. Your children and grandchildren need the support they will need to eat. We need to keep this land for them, for the future because.And soon Serena will be followed by Jo Chan.Hi. Serena Glover, executive director, Friends of Some Average Valley. There have been some positive changes in this new striker, but there's still two very serious flaws. The key issue here is not about real wineries brews the stories.That make product. Those are all in eastern Washington or in the urban areas. This is about where these.Businesses put.Their retail outlets. The ordinance is seriously.Flawed in two ways. The first is they put these retail outlets in demonstration project overlay.It rewards five of our eight Sammamish Valley violators and opens another eight new.Parcels to.Urban use development. The second problem with the ordinance.As we still have.Opaque definitions of would be these that are riddled with loopholes and it will allow these sham bids to really operate as retail outlets in the rural area.These urban uses cause two huge problems for the farmland in the watershed.The first is toxic runoff. You've heard a lot about this already. The second is land price speculation.You've also heard a ton about that.And it's getting worse, not better. And so any ordinance that skirts.The.GMA rewards the violators is only going to.Increase speculation.Increase environmental.Degradation.And create more public.Health and safety issues. And because of that.We will fully challenge any ordinance that violates GMA and allows these urban use businesses in the rural area of the Sammamish Valley. It's only two miles long and one mile wide, and it cannot.Take.This kind of development if you want to preserve the farmland and the watershed. Thank you.Thank you, cousin members. My name is Joseph Chan, I. I live right in the valley of Sammamish. For a long, long time. I'm here to bargain for the essential right for life. And I'm begging for a. Essential economic department.You know, any kind. I'm not just limited to the winery, but this winery, Jack. Too long. And it has a negative impact to my property and to property price increase, my property tax increase. And even the impact my exemption I heard was because of this ordinance.Please have an essential like the complain the introduction. The key point is that equity in other words have an equal opportunity of economy development, every essential development. So to me the concept is wider. You know, the niche of the valley is the tolerating anything related to have people enjoy life.I would encourage but anyway these these development the new striking whatever is winding here and there and getting worse. Thank you. Bet.Thank you. That includes the people who had signed up in advance. Is there anyone else present who would like to offer testimony? Anyone else who'd like to offer testimony, then we'll close the public hearing. And the issue before us is ordinance 2018 241.The Council has been working on this ordinance for more than a year. It was taken up first by the Local Services Regional Roads and Bridges Committee. When that committee finished its work, the legislation was sent to the full council where it was determined that more work was needed and that all nine of us should be involved inthat work. And therefore it is before the committee of the whole at this time. Today we'll have a hearing, a hearing, a briefing from Aaron Osnes of Arts Council central staff on the legislation and amendments. And it's my hope we'd be ready to take action today.Ms.. Osnes.Sorry. Good afternoon. Aaron Austin's council staff. The materials for this item in your packet began on page 35, but we're not going to use it, so don't bother looking at it. You also have a larger supplemental packet that looks like this.This has the Stryker and other amendment materials. You also got public comments that were received today as a packet and a smaller amendment package that includes some amendments from Councilmember Lambert of the New Matrix. So again, the big packet, the center does have a bit of background in it, but I'm not going to go through it todayunless you really want me to, except to say that my daughter is three years old and I was pregnant with her when the executive started this.One.Just to graduate from high school.I don't know.What does she think of this legislation?She would like me to drink less.And mommy to be home more. Yeah.So I'm going to go through what starts on the back page of the big supplemental packet. Your your copies have a purple column. So that's what you're looking for. This matrix is organized. It includes two columns. One is the legislation that came out of the Local Services Committee or version two.I'll refer to it either way. And then the purple column is what is in striking amendment S1 and I. The bigger subset of items are first and then there are several pages we probably won't get to. There just have more clarifying changes or tactical changes that we can answer questions about.So starting at the top of page two of your supplemental packet as recommended by the Local Services Committee, the ordinance would prohibit weeds, which is winery brewery distillery facilities and remote tasting rooms as home occupations and home industries.The version two of the legislation allowed for some grandfathering that gave these businesses one year to come into compliance with the zoning requirements for home occupations and home industries. In the striker S-1 there, the changes to that proposal include removing the 12 month period to come into compliance and replaces it with a 12 month period to demonstratetheir previous compliance with the with the code as it exists today, but will no longer exist after it's adopted. If it is adopted. It also tighten some language to avoid unintended consequences and loopholes. And that removes the 12 month compliance period for home industries because those always require a conditioning instrument which are they don't have an ambassadorapplication, they won't be able to arrest.Masters. What's the difference between a 12 month grandfathering period and 12 months to demonstrate the previous compliance?So under the S1 proposal, a business that is compliant today will have non-conforming status. They have a year to prove that they were conforming on that day versus what's in version two is they get a year to come into compliance with what is in the code today.That makes sense. Okay. Next item, the business license version two carries forward the exact proposal to require an adult beverage business license for all production facilities and remote tasting rooms as well as non-conforming home occupations. The. S1 adds language requiring existing businesses attempting to demonstrate that past compliance by submitting some documentation with their first business license.It allows a single six month county business license to be issued to such existing businesses that are demonstrating their compliance. It would be extended for an additional six month without charge if they have demonstrated they were making substantial progress to prove their compliance and then subsequent county business licenses would not be issued unless that they have demonstratedtheir legal nonconforming status. They have again made substantial steps to prove compliance or they comply with the zoning regulations that are in the proposal. And it also adds a provision so that the permitting division can deny a business license if they do not, if the business does not comply with the zoning code and modifies the appeal periodfor the license to provide consistency with other types of zoning appeals. Moving onto page three of the packet, page three.Questions, Mr. Chair, as we go on. Yes. On point questions.Yes. Council Member Debates.Thank you, Mr.. I'm sorry, I don't know this, but does the county require, like many cities, a general business license today?No.All right.We require some business licenses, mostly for tracking purposes, but also have some dependent.Is it just industry specific?Thank you. Okay. The next item on packet page three. There is one demonstration project now proposed by this ordinance. It is a remote tasting room demonstration. Demonstration project. A I'm not going to go through every single specific item on the left side, but I will talk about the changes.The striker would clarify the purpose statement and the business license requirements. It would eliminate the fashion rural town, CB zoning and the fall city rural town CB zoning from the demonstration projects and instead would make permanent zoning modifications to allow remote tasting rooms in the S.B. zones of Vachon Rural Town and Falsity Rural Town.It also clarifies the limitation on events, which is two per year maximum of 50 guests. No two permit required for is for all proprietors of a single site within that demonstration project. It also makes some substance substantive changes to the evaluation language.That was done in consultation and coordination with the executive staff to make it a little bit more manageable. Going on the next page. Page four of the.Mr. Terror.Packet went to.The mosque.I think you I don't know if this is appropriate for central staff is going over a factual assessment or or summary. But could could you help me understand with respect to the changes there on the rural town centers?What what's the rationale for.For taking them out? Yeah. So. The. Remote tasting rooms are being added to the permitted use tables for the first time. That wasn't a use in the code before. So since. It is a new use and the piece of explanation or adios for the falsity investment in real town list specific uses out.It was its added to those users to be consistent with the underlying zoning for the rest of the county for those for the KB Zone. Mr. Chair.Councilmember Bell.Maybe since the question went to the reason for the including this, I could just say a word. The idea was that in the previous versions, I think all of them Vachon Town Center and Falsity Town Center were included as part of what's called overlay a as a demonstration area.And because these are real town centers with businesses in them, like including bars and things like that, it seemed like it wasn't really a major change to the area to allow tasting rooms in those areas. So we just went ahead and made it a permitted use instead of having it be part of a demonstration project.I hope that was.Very helpful thing.Okay. Going to a packet page for the version to the legislation included a second demonstration project, which was special events demonstration and Project B, the S-1 removes that from the ordinance. Moving on to page six. There is an additional efficacy evaluation that is in version two.The Stryker makes modifications to that efficacy evaluation, remove some of the requirements that had been in there before and then add some requirements for evaluation of the regulations on existing businesses and recommended code changes on a number of the development regulations and then ties the public comment period and transmittal of that final report with the one requiredfor the demonstration project. Okay. Turning on page seven is the development condition modifications that are proposed by the striker. If I go too fast, just slow me down. These are also spelled out more clearly in the tables below, but I'm not going to go through each table individually.So the substantive changes to the permitted use tables and the development conditions associated with them in the striker include eliminating facility ones in the agricultural zone as an interim use, so the smallest facilities would not be allowed in the zone.It eliminates the allowance for 8000 square feet of underground storage for facility threes, both in a and free zone. So the maximum size for those facilities would be 8000 square feet total. For all facilities in the A and R zones.It limits impervious surface to a maximum of 25% or whatever the underlying zoning allows, whichever is less. It requires facility threes and the agricultural in our zones to connect to a group, a water system, eliminating the option to connect to a group B water system.For facility ones in the rural area zone. It prohibits onsite testing and retail sales. For facility twos and threes in their a an hour zone. It limits onsite tasting and retail sales to 15% of the aggregated floor area for facility twos and threes in the zone, it limits conversion of agricultural land to less than one acre fornonagricultural accessory uses for all facilities in a no zones, it requires one. The version two requires at least two phases of production to occur on site. This goes further and says that one of those phases has to be either crushing, fermenting or distilling.For our facilities, it removes the option to reduce the setback from rural area and residential zones with a C up to 25 feet. So the setback would be 75 feet in such instances, four facility ones in the RC zone.It allows once one onsite parking stall for the use. It eliminates a provision that had been added into version two that would allow for some grandfathering of existing parking spaces and then for facilities, twos and threes in a and ARI zones that modifies the maximum parking to 150% of the minimum required.I have another.Thing.Mr. Chair, another kind of reason question if that's okay. And with respect to the WB, D1 is also the smallest of the three, right. In terms of their production. Could could someone help me understand the philosophical reason or the land use rationale?Maybe to put it in central staff terms for discouraging, if I'm reading this correctly, the small facilities on the ag lands. What's what's.The. I'll speak to what happened. And then I read that he can take over the exact.As opposed to the big ones, which would seem to be.Permitted. The executives transmittal did not include the facility ones in the ASM. The version two added an interim facility. One use in the ASN. They would have had to go away or convert to a facility to within five years.And I'll speak to Councilman Bolden to speak to why the Hershiser takes it out. But so this goes back to what the executive proposed.Just another word on the executive proposal here. One of the big challenges with current code and with enforcement of current code is the home occupations. And it's just really hard to do fact finding around what is truly a home occupation versus what is not.And so our understanding from the Department was that a big part of the WB ones was a sort of a replacement for home occupations to be better defined and better able to be managed. And I see a little nodding.So that makes me feel better because I'm speaking to their rationale, the idea for and those were never proposed to be allowed in the ag zones. That would have been an expansion of uses from what we currently have.The idea for having the WB ones in the ag zones was as an incentive, if you will, for farmers. Those of you who who represent farmers or know about farming know that the challenge of making a living as a farmer is such these days that many of them are branching out into side businesses or to other activitiesin order to support their farms. And so the idea was that if you could try out the sales of something before you had to commit your fields to growing the necessary crops, you could discover whether it was financially viable and then commit your fields to growing.And it was a way of giving farmers a step up into a new business, if you will. When we proposed this as part of the combined striker last time at Local Services, after that went public, I have to say there was not a single person who expressed any support for this idea.Farmers didn't like it, businesses didn't see any need for it, it just didn't do anything. And some people thought that it was a foot in the door to really expanding commercial uses in the ag zones. And that's why I proposed taking it out, because it didn't solve anything for anybody that I heard from.If there's somebody listening now who thinks it solves something, please let me know. But I haven't heard from anybody like that, and it did cause concerns from people who cared about the ag zone. So I just took it out.Think that the thing else that Christine wanted me to mention is that the current code requires that 60% of the products be grown in Puget Sound counties for the A zone, it's proposed to be changed to 60% grown on site.So the facility ones would have a maintained that Puget Sound counties it was a as because member mentioned it it was kind of like a starting point for those smaller facilities.Can I also say the other thing we heard the thing we I heard from farmers, they actually and I asked I said, why doesn't this do anything for you? And what we heard was it takes a lot longer than five years to establish a crop big enough and in a sustainable enough way to be able to reallyrely on it as your business crop. And so to just say, here's five years, see if you can grow enough wheat to have a brewery. Right. Wasn't. It wasn't helpful. It was an attempt to be helpful. It didn't hit the mark.And so we backed away.That's all I was going to present on so I can take questions or speak to the line amendments if you like.Questions on the striker is striker from committee or the striker before us. The striker would be proposed today by Councilmember Balducci. What would members find helpful to continue discussion of the line amendments to take up the ordinance line amendments?Let's brief on the amendments.So now we're going to go to the smaller packet. There's some odd numbering here just because of how amendments became public today. So bear with me. 0.18 would remove the 15% square footage limitation for onsite tasting and retail sales of products for facility twos and threes in the eight and ARI zones.A moment 0.2 B for all facilities for properties that do not about an agricultural zone. It would add the option to reduce the 75 foot setback from residential and rural areas on properties to 25 feet, with a signatory as permit and with screening.Amendment one.A Before we question about the amendment, Councilmember Lambert.Thank you. I'm not sure that everybody both here and the listening audience understands what a conditional use permit is, how much time it takes, and what the cost is. So if you could give a little conditional use permit one on one, that would be helpful.We'd have Johnny pull it up. It is a type two land use permit, so it requires public notice, environmental review and it a written decision by the permitting division. It is appealable to the hearings, amateur and then to superior court.And as an Internet.What is Mr. Adobe?Well, I.Think.You did great. You did? That's what I'm saying. Needs Internet. Who needs to look something up? You just did that.I think it costs somewhere between six and $8,000, depending on what they use it and how.Long it usually take.I don't know. Yeah, it really depends.I have an answer sitting in that back corner I saw, but I don't library very well.62 months. Six, 6 to 12 months.Sometimes it feels like 62, so it was 6 to 12 months and could be 6 to $8000. So this is not something that is willy nilly. And I think it's important for people to understand that this is this is a process, not a crackerjack.I got it in the cracker jack box and I got it.Okay. Amendment one A would make some changes specific to Basho Mori Island only in the gray zone and only for facility two. It would for historic properties set the minimum lot area at two acres would allow up to 7000 square feet of aggregated floor area for historic properties would exempt existing businesses from the minimum lot size requirementsfrom the arterial access requirements. And from the 75 foot setback, four from rural and residential zones also would remove the 15% square footage limitation on tasting and retail sales for that's for existing businesses and for historic properties only on Russian Maria Island.One, B, E and G are alternatives to one a. If the first two pass or don't pass a moment. Two would modify the minimum parking ratio for the tasting and retail areas of production facilities to one space per 150 square feet of tasting and retail area.And there is a tidal limit.So we would have a structure before us. We, as it was referred from for council, we have another striking amendment before us and then just one page of amendments.Yeah. You have a version to then a striking amendment. That's an 18 out.Colleagues. Council Member Belle du Jour.Questions in order about the line amendments right now or should we wait until we walk through the process?Yes, we took questions on the structure. I think it'd be appropriate to take questions on the line amendments now as well.If I may. Yeah. On Amendment one, a just generally sort of I have a technical question and a background question. The background question is how many businesses are we talking about? And based on Moray Island and a lot of email.But how many businesses?Less than ten.Analyst Okay. And if I'm reading this correctly, it exempts historic. Properties and existing businesses as to most of the requirements. But what about the 15% square footage limitation?Yeah, there's a typo in the matrix. It's the 15% limitation on chasing your cells again is only for existing businesses and historic properties.And the technical question is, with existing businesses leaving historic properties aside for a moment, that would be existing as of.January 1st.January 1st of 2019 this year. And it would what happened if those businesses wanted to expand.They would be considered legally non-conforming. And then the requirements for legal.Non-Conforming, there's a certain amount of squish, but not a whole lot of squish, as I recall here. Not the legal term.Okay. Thank you. I like.Council member Col Wells.Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just have a clarification question. I was the for both the striking amendment and the line amendments was the striking amendment and have been these amendments today. The line amendments been provided to people online.I guess at the time.The striking amendment was online. Last week. They left Monday so we could go.But these are.New, not correct. Thank you. Well, Councilman McDermott has been sharing his amendment.And I know for the broader community.They were not published.No more questions on the linemen line amendments. Councilmember Dombroski.Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'll just take that opportunity to say I have a lot of questions, but I don't frankly have the ability to ask them in an intelligent and an integrated way with the other stuff, because they're so new on this coming forward here today.And this is I know we spent a lot of time, a whole baby's lifetime working on this. But and I think we are making substantial progress. And I want to commend those who have taken the lead on it for their hard work.But I would just want to note, you asked about process, and I heard you say that you'd hope we can move forward today. I'm not prepared to move forward today. I won't be able to support any of this today.I might be able to get there after I've had a time to think about it and to look at it because a lot of it's new. I think we do our best work by sharing the information and I credit customer about that for publishing a schedule and sharing her advice.Striking an amendment. Last week, it was helpful to be able to look at the chart and I'm still digging in. But our public also, as we heard in public comment today, deserves, I think, the opportunity to have these materials provide input.We have delivered us here, I don't know, 40 pages of 62 page pages, a public comment from September 13th through the 16th. I've not been able to read it. I know that we have time after a hearing, but one thing that would help me would be just to spend a little time with, I think, where we standtoday on this on these items. And I know you, Mr. Chair, have made time on your schedule, so all of my members can weigh in on this committee. And I know it's very limited. Just a thought. We do have a five week month here.And that fifth week, as we know, is available for special meetings or one. If members wanted more time and there was availability Monday, the 30th could be another opportunity and folks had time to do additional reflection. But that's kind of where I'm at.I'm going do the best I can today day. But I will tell you, I would like to be more familiar with the materials than I am and the public input on them than I'm able to be today. But thank you.Further dialog input from members. This legislation was introduced at least a year and a half ago, I believe well over a year ago, has gone through the committee process and made its way to full council and has now been referred back to the committee of the whole so we can all do work on it.We've had a striker out since last Monday for all of us to have a chance to review if there is interest in moving today, we could take up amendments and vote. If there's an interest in having more time to make sure we've got a good handle on the legislation before us and there would be value in that, then I would make time at our next count, our next committee, the whole meeting to take this up. After that, it might get challenging, but it'd be my expectation that we would all, to borrow perhaps an overused phrase, lean in and be in a position to come ready to take up this work in an earnest sense atour next regular council meeting. Is with an interest in moving it today on my part to have the committee calendar open up again. Councilmember Lambert.I agree with Councilmember Dombrowski. There is a lot of changes to what we had been talking about for over a year. It came out of committee. There was a task force nearly four years ago now, even before your baby.So. I have worked on legislation that has been national with fewer hours and weeks and months going into it. And so I think that what it comes down to and is do we want to have a place that businesses can thrive, that the ambiance of the rural area can be preserved?People who live in the rural area and go out to the rural area want to see the farmlands. They want to see the beauty of the area. Rural people like to meet together. When you drive by this area, there are happy faces there.Places are full. People are having a great time. We have put together something here today where as it was testified to, there could be 7 to 18 parking slots. So with some of the changes that certain kinds of fermenting and such would need to be done on site, that would mean that there have to be extra employees, which would also cut into the profits of the business, which are also cut into the idea that there would be parking available. So if two couples decided, I'd like to go out and have a drink with you tonight, let's all meet at X place.They would get there and if there were seven parking spots that would be four cars. Hopefully there'd be somebody there to wait on them. So that could be two or three. So now there would be no other parking spaces for anybody else to come.I would guess that at least when I owned a business, if I didn't have any parking spaces for my customers to come to, I wouldn't be in business very long. So when we talk about rural character, we need to be looking at not killing all of the places where people want to go to congregate.This is a place where people are happy to be there. This place would not have thrived for this many years if it weren't some place that people like to come to that 15%. I don't even know where that number came from, but it has huge impacts and people say, well, they can park on the arterials or thearterials, that there are two main roads, there are no places to park. They said, Well, you can take a bus. That would be really nice that there were busses saying that you were going to prohibit on site sales.They can do it in the industrial area. I went door to door to I don't even know how many industrial areas and asked them how many slots they would have per month for sales from another tasting room. And almost to a person.They said, Oh my gosh, I get so many phone calls about this, I can't even keep up with the demand. So that's not a viable option. And over and over in demonstration, a two events per year with a maximum of 50 people, you're allowed that in your own backyard, in your own house.And it's not even even a real route. It's not even a business. You know, when you look at one of the amendments on one of the amendments, it says to preserve historic properties that I agree with, completely historic properties should be able to continue on with those kinds of things.But then it says to be exempted from the amendment requirements. We worked really hard on adding minimum requirements so that it couldn't proliferate and the value in the valley. We talked about arterial access as opposed to some flexibility with rural access.We talked about the idea, the setbacks and having some flexibility under a C u.p. And last but not least, I'd like to show you the chart Fiji poll that showed up on the wall. I have it here bigger for people in the audience.No. Everything in green on this chart. I get my stats, all that up for me. Everything in green on this chart has been preserved already by. By either our farm preservation or our agriculture production. Just we have some kind of claim on everything in green that shows you that we care about this.This part right here is where they want to build a 22 acre parcel, which originally was going to be called the Wine Village. Thank you. So with all of that green area, it's clear that we are trying to get the balance between between protecting our farmlands and also keeping rural, rural lifestyle in many places in the country. Wine tasting is considered an ag use. So we tried to get the balance over a year of collaboration with I don't even know how many hours of your time and other legal staff. For people who don't know, we have a very extensive legal team in King County, and I think they probably all have ulcers from dealing withall this over and over. So I think I think there's two things we as a council need to decide. Do we want to put all these businesses out? And if that's what the council wants to do, then let's just say that if that is not what we want to do, then we need to say, okay, how arewe going to make them viable and how are we going to then have a a rich rural lifestyle where there is balance? This is not balance. This is putting them out of business just about. And I'm sad that after all these years of working and trying to come up with a compromise, that today we're sitting here withsomething that will put these businesses pretty much out of business. And then my next question after that, myself, at 3:00 in the morning, when I woke up and wrote the speech, was what will happen? Yes, I will go to three in the morning.Yeah, I did go to sleep all night long. What will happen to these businesses? These are small little houses where people have turned them into very delightful places for people to congregate. And for the record, people have said that I am trying to get this compromised because I spend so much time out there.For the record, I drink very little alcohol in my entire life. So the idea that that's the motivation is blatantly inaccurate. But moving on from that. So we need to decide what we want to have. And if if we take and say, okay, no tasting rooms, no wineries here, no anything, then what's going to happen to thesebusinesses? We're going to have a section leading up to a 22 acre industrial, commercial, industrial, commercial place that is going to be vacant. And is that what we really want? Or could we find a way of making an ambiance that is compatible with what is going to be there?And what I would say is already there. When you talk about, say, Michel and Columbia Winery and the the tourist district of wouldn't those so I agree we should put this on at a future meeting and we need to get everybody in a room to decide, are we going to continue to have real lifestyle out here orare we going to completely get it? And I think that's where we are today. So I hope that we will make a decision to come together with a more reasonable plan.Giving you discussion of the details, I thought we were ready to take action and make decisions. Councilmember Bell Duty.Thank you, Mr. Chair. Question Point of order. Did I hear you say that there is room on the September 16th call for this or there may be room on this?Councilmember Bell Dutchie, I'm really glad you are sorry. Today is. No, no, no, no. You know what? I'm don't interrupt the chair. I guarantee you, there is action in the committee, the hall on September 16th.Okay.Let me rephrase. Is there room on the agenda at the next council meeting to work on this, or is it something that is not not yet determined?We can make sure I can make room on the October 7th next regularly scheduled meeting of the committee of the whole.To take this up so that it would.Be with the it would be tough to do so anytime after that. Right. Given the committee's workload for the rest of the year. Okay.In that case, just stating my own opinion with regard to the timing. If members feel that they need some more time to have more committee discussion and we can do it within the next couple of weeks, that makes sense to me.There is or there should be a 30 day comment period after we pass it out of committee again, which we've done before, but we should do again. So that means that we're not seeing this for final action at the earliest until late October, early November.I just wanted to point that out. So people are aware because there's been some conversation about this being rushed through, that's that's not going to be the case between now and the end.I would say if you don't take action until October 7th, you're not seeing this in full council until December because of Thanksgiving.So it gets pushed quite a ways back. I would be willing to move this item forward without recommendation today in order to get that notice out there and to get it moving. But it means taking up substantive amendments at full council.So I want to pause and see how people feel about that before making any kind of motion.Councilmember Gossett.Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. A little earlier, I was going to say that I concurred with Councilman DEMBOSKY and Councilmember Lambert that we wait. But Cathy made a case for taking certain kind of positions and that extended that a little bit more.But it just added to the questions that I had. I really think that I'm in the camp that we need to wait a couple of weeks. I was struck by the fact that it was both representatives of the industry, the winery industry, as well as people here who are here to protect what they deem to be thereal character of the affected area. And they really were kind of surprised about the latest set of amendments to what we have been working on a year. And to me, it's reasonable that they would get an opportunity to vet what is being proposed and a bit more from both the side of the industry as well as ofprotecting the real character of the affected areas. And then lastly, Mr. Chair, I was surprised that all of this impacts Bash on either in looking at the amendment that you presented, I, like some of the folks that spoke, did not know that what we were talking about would have such a profound impact on bass and island.And maybe I should have and I'd like to have time to look at that. So I'm hopeful that we'll be able to put it off for two weeks and not even make a vote on it without recommendation today.Thank you, sir.Councilmember of unranked power.Thank you, Mr. Chair. First of all, I want to thank you for taking a leadership role on your amendment. It was something that I know you've been working on over the last seven days, in particular, trying to find a even balance between the concerns have been raised countywide and but recognizing the uniqueness of Ashe on island.I really do want to thank you for doing that. People don't truly appreciate how unique fashion is and how you can. By applying a county view, sometimes you do bad work, hurt a very fragile economy and a fragile part of our county, which has not benefited from the growth and development of other portions of King County, butis very much a part of King County and wants to be a part of King County. But sometimes when you try to apply Bellevue. Tactics to bash on Allen they backfire. And I'm upset that both Councilmember Dunn and now do cheers from Bellevue.But the reality is Virginia is a very unique area. And I want to thank you as somebody who actually is still a taxpayer from based on our. That said, Mr. Chair, I think just as wine ages. Well, so should this legislation age a little.Well. And I want to thank Councilmember Baldacci, who has taken a hard lot of work on this issue, trying to find some balance. And it's a very difficult one given not only here own philosophy, but also on his her district.So I'm hoping we can age this process a little bit, give it a chance for it to settle in and have a chance to digest it properly.Council Member one Mike Bauer I am all for a well-aged wine. I'm concerned about vinegar.And I also point out to you that contrary to what Councilmember Lambert said, that she is not someone who has drank a lot of wine. I cannot make that same claim. Thank you.Okay.And that I'm going to intervene and point out that we have that the waiting period, the the comment period that would be announced would be a 45 day wait comment period. I would suggest that would happen from time of of committee action prior to so a 45 day period between committee action and full council action.And the comment was made that if we took it up and I would be clear at the next regularly scheduled council meeting, not in two weeks, but three weeks would. There would need to be committee committee work. I would suggest there needs to be more than committee work, but work among members to have conversations about the legislation. So we are ready to take action at a committee meeting at the next regularly scheduled committee of the whole meeting on this legislation. And with that, I would suggest it would be best handled by taking it up, leaving it in committee, and taking it up at our next regularly scheduled council meeting.Councilmember Bell Dutchie Mr. Chair, may I ask the indulgence of my colleagues for just a couple of minutes to explain what I did and why, since we're not doing this here today and since we've had a lot of discussion.So I'm just going to thank you. I'm just going to go ahead and do that, please. So with apologies again for the repetition. The current code was written in 2003 prior to the proliferation of the winery brewery distillery industry that you've seen in the last 15 years in our cities and in unincorporated King County.The code did not adequately predict this future, and therefore it's ambiguous. It doesn't match the reality we're seeing today, and it's been hard to enforce. The ambiguity has made it hard for people who want to follow the rules in established businesses to figure out how to comply with the code.And we've heard a lot of that. It's also meant that there's been a lack of enforcement in places where there probably ought to have been enforcement. We've heard today, and I've personally met with people who've spent thousands of dollars trying to comply with the code and they can't quite get there.So my pitch to my colleagues between now and the next meeting is we should pass something. I'm not one to be overly attached to every detail of something that I have personally proposed, but we should pass something because leaving things the way they are now is is kind of an untenable situation, I think, for everybody.So in recognition of this fact, the county committed to updating the code some years ago, prior to Councilmember Caldwell's and I coming on, the council and the executive entered into settlement agreements with businesses that had not been able to be permitted or that were violating code.20 businesses, I understand, signed letter agreements. This is all in the Sammamish Valley. They agreed that they would not expand their businesses or change operations while we went through the code update process. There are dozens more that are not subject to agreements but have been in limbo for years and will continue in limbo as long as thisis pending, as pending, as is the community not knowing what the rules are going to be. So as we all know, the executive convened a winery's study. It was focused on the Sammamish Valley. That's correct. That we heard from some of the Vachon and other folks.It was not really focused on county wide, although there was some study of countywide trends and impacts within the the adult beverage industry. That was not the focus. However, this code proposal has been focused on all of King County since at least April of 2018 when we received it.So it's not a new thing that this is a county wide code. It's just that as we get towards the end here, the changes that are made to apply countywide and are are new. I will recall to everybody that Councilmember Lambert and I worked hard on amendments to the executive's proposal after we received it, and we triedvery hard to get to a place of real compromise. That meant that she compromised on things that were important to her, and I compromised on things that were important to me. We put together a proposal that was an attempt at a good balance between proposing agriculture, preserving excuse me, agricultural land and the rural character, and providing clearrules under which businesses could know how to operate and successfully operate. In some ways, that proposal was more restrictive for businesses and more protective of the environment than the executive's proposal. In a few ways, it was more flexible.We went to the full council with this proposal. We, after hearing it at the Local Services Committee and we heard in between there and at the meeting from many, many people and there was a lot of folks on both sides who thought they didn't like it.We didn't hear a lot of support and there was not support on this council to pass that proposal. So it was referred back to committee and not back to the smaller committee, back to this large committee of all of us, because that was the level of importance and focus that the council body, in our collective judgment, feltit needed. So when people ask what happened to that prior proposal, that's what happened. There wasn't support on this council to pass it, and so we had to do something. So in response to the extensive comment and Councilmember Lambert and I also had a big public meeting, we went out at night into the An Amish Valley.We listen to over 100 people. I've made visits. I know she has and others to to folks all over on all sides of this issue to try to grasp and understand the issues as best we can. So in response to all of that, I had been thinking about this for a very, very long time, and I preparedthis new set of amendments. That's how we work here. When you've got a piece of legislation in committee, we, each of us have the ability and the right to propose amendments. And I've done that. What I tried to do was to further protect agricultural lands and, yes, tighten up the definitions and the rules for the businesses.That's correct. That's what I attempted to do in order to make it clear what was allowed and not allowed and to make sure that there isn't an opportunity, which we heard a lot of fear about expansion of these businesses in the unincorporated areas.So you heard a lot about I'm not going to talk about what the striker contains. We've already had that all briefed. But one of the main features of this was that it was meant to limit the amount of ongoing activity and expansion in the unincorporated areas.That was the goal to make sure that this wasn't something that could expand and continue to provide. To to put in place more impervious surface, more activity, more parking, more more things that impact not just the rural areas, but also the agricultural valley below in the sammamish valley.So just. I'm almost there. But let me just say, I want to be very clear what this code does and doesn't do this whole code, not just this proposal, not just my amendment, not just this code, change the code addresses, uses the state grants, licenses that allow people to produce alcohol.We are regulating only unincorporated King County. So when people say this will wipe out the industry, untrue, the industry is flourishing, flourishing in the incorporated areas just across the street in a ceramic valley and in other places the business.But this will this code. Regulates where businesses can be located and to some extent how they operate. So there are still life safety rules, building codes, critical areas, regulations, shoreline management, Endangered Species Act requirements, storm water, water requirements, surface water standards.Public Health Code. All of these continue to apply to every single one of these businesses, regardless of whether we pass this or not. So the impact of those businesses is being managed through a number of different codes, not just this use code.I just say that because I want to make sure that people are aware that King County is committed to the health and safety of our residents and the preservation of agricultural lands and rural character in more ways than just the use code.I also want to say that I'm committed and I hope we all are committed, that when we update this code, no matter what it says, no matter how it impacts businesses and residents, we should make targeted investments to help businesses come into compliance if they can.And we should make investments to make sure that there's code enforcement for those who won't or can't come into compliance, because not enforcing the code has been part of the problem that grew in the Sammamish Valley, as we heard.I want to say, I've heard from the people on Virgin Island and and I've heard from Councilmember von Reich Brower, who I did not realize was such a version, a proponent of, you know, maybe you could work together a little bit there.And I'm happy to learn more about what's going on on Bastion Island. And the number of businesses is quite small. It doesn't have the same growth and expansion and therefore impact that we've seen in other places. So I look forward to talking to Councilmember McDermott about his perspective.But but I think we need to move forward and we need to adopt something in 16 months that we've had this in front of us. We've heard from hundreds of residents, dozens of businesses, organizations, and we're reaching the end.I think we should take some time to understand what we're doing, but if we're going to act at all, we should act soon. The current situation isn't sustainable and it isn't working for people. So I look forward to us finding a way through within the next few weeks, and I thank you for your time to let mesay some words, Mr. Chair.COUNCILMEMBER Louder.Thank you, Mr. Chair. Well, we worked really hard on this, both in our committee and then individually. And at the beginning, many of you said, Let's have two people go out and find it. They could come up with a compromise bill that was good public policy and there were many compromises being made.And, you know, as it came over originally, it was supposed to close at 5 p.m. tasting rooms close by PM. I don't even get out of my last committee meeting until after 5 p.m. many days and then an hour, hour and a half to get to get home again, change my clothes.They would be closed every night of the week. So should I want to join Councilmember Von Right Barua? He drinks a glass of wine. It would already be closed. Wine or beer? Maybe two to as many as you want.I'll be your designated driver. I'm good at that.You know. Happy to do that if you want. I'm happy to just.About get into that, though. And we we many people on this council said it's complicated. Let's two of you go up who have a vested interest because it touches your district and come up with good public policy. And public policy needs to be clear defined rules and it needs to balance the things that we hold dear.And what we hold dear is protecting the agricultural land. And we also hold dear the idea that there needs to be a rural lifestyle and a rural lifestyle includes places where people can go and congregate and be together.And yes, if they would like, they can have a glass of whatever they choose to drink. And code enforcement, we talked about repeatedly in the budget where we are adding new employees to make sure that when the rules were passed that they could be enforced.You know, I really respect the requests of Bash on Island because in fact, that's what we all would want exactly what the request is. But I would say that all the county should be given that same opportunity within limits.And we set those limits. We said there had to be a minimum acreage requirement so that they would not proliferate. We were very clear on what ours needed to close and. We made sure that it was at least in line and even stricter than the noise ordinance when we heard things about the parking problems.We started out with saying, hey, look, let's just not get into that because it's a complicated formula. Let's leave it at one car for every 50 square feet of commercial area. And then it went to 150 feet for one parking slot.And now this new one says 300 square feet. We do need to pass something, but it needs to be something that is balanced. What we have before us today is really to say wipe it all out and it doesn't need to exist.And I would guess that on any weekend there will be so many thousands of people or hundreds of people driving to, say, Michele's Saint Columbia, to Jill's new place to theaters anziani all within the same block as and including in 22 acres at the end of the street that is going to be there.This could be a very vibrant place that we could be symbiotic to and complement. As opposed to saying that we want this to be an empty, deserted place. Well, going into wouldn't there. So I hope that as we go forward in the next couple of weeks, we will balance that, in fact.Wine tasting is a rural use and a rural thing that people like to do, including urban people who come to visit. So it needs to have balance. And I'm willing to work with whoever it like to to make some changes on the underlying bill, not the one that's before us today, because I believe that completely wipes outthe industry. But let's work for something that makes sense to everybody.The two speak. If we're speaking to legislation and putting issues out before us. I'd like to also speak to the fact on an amendment that I have drafted and as Councilmember Balducci and Ms.. Osnes have alluded to, this comes from the entire ordinance before us, comes from a study that was done in the Sammamish Valley because ofissues that had been identified in that community, and the ordinance attempts to address some of those issues. At the same time, those issues don't exist on baseline. It is a small number of existing such businesses and those are the issues that are being addressed in this mama's valley.Don't exist on the island. The. Amendment that I bring would allow would apply only to existing wineries, distilleries and breweries on Bastion Island. Would not. Would not change land. Ongoing land use code for the island would. It would apply to existing businesses.Any new businesses seeking to open undersigned would have to apply with whatever code we adopted and existing businesses, should they do a significant expansion would also need to comply with the new code as we adopt not a free for all or an exemption for VAT on.And so I want to I'm sure that as I've advocated with my colleagues over the last week intensely with the amendment and in conversation over the last several months as we've talked about the ordinance itself with that seen no one else would comment council member von Reich Bauer.Thank you. I just urge my colleagues and anybody in the audience if they have a chance to read the Bible first.

The committee recommends the resolution be adopted as amended.Councilmember O'Brien.Thank you. I'll just speak briefly to this and give a chance to my colleague, Councilmember Pacheco, to speak to it as he has done a lot of work on this. We heard in public comment today from a lot of folks, and I really appreciate everyone here finding public comment both to the need to have more mobility optionsfor everyone and for the need to ensure that we provide the infrastructure and the enforcement to ensure that people using the various mobility options do it appropriately. This specific piece of legislation is a step in getting the infrastructure built so that there are places for folks to park their bicycle scooters or whatever comes along next in themobility world. There's continued work to do enforcement, and I really appreciate the comments. Marci, your comments in particular you helped share with me over the over the last week in another jurisdiction where I believe one of the one of the E-Scooter share companies had created penalties for folks that are parking those that are their customers, who areparking the scooters inappropriately. And I think that is an enforcement step that we need to do. We don't have e-scooters, but we do have bikes. And I think we should step up our enforcement and work with the companies that are on our streets to hold their customers accountable and make sure that they have a place to doit. I also appreciate your comments, Marci, about making sure that we're simply not penalizing low income folks and making it so that they no longer can afford to have access to the type of mobility ability options that some communities may be in most need of happening.So it's complex. And the thing that gives me hope is there's an amazing group of advocates that represent a broad swath of our community that are thoughtfully engaged in finding solutions. And we will work through that complexity as a city if we're going to be successful.And having folks engaged is is an amazing thing. And so sorry I spoke too long, but I want to hand it over to Councilman Pacheco to speak specifically to this legislation.Councilman Pacheco.Well, first, I want to thank the community advocates with the mass coalition for doing so much work, as well as advocacy here today as well as prior in my council colleagues, Councilmember O'Brien and Mosquito, who have come with some recommendations and some amendments in committee.So the budget proposal, it's the resolutions is to start to come back to us with a budget proposal to double buy the number of bikeshare and scooter parking spaces by next year, as well as include provisions for financial penalties to enforce proper parking of the bike share and scooters.As we've heard today during public comment, the need for us to have better enforcement of these mobility options and so I'm excited to get to have post have voted this out of committee as well as hopefully be able to get this out of council today so that we can have our assignment before us before we get tothe budget later this month.Thank you, Katherine Pacheco. Any more comments on the resolution? Councilmember Mesquita.Thank you very much, Mr. President. I want to take a quick second to thank council members Pacheco and Councilmember O'Brien for taking the first steps on this legislation to really help us get scooters into Seattle in a safe and responsible way.I think we've been able to hear from a number of transit advocates or multi-modal transit transportation advocates that there is a desire to help promote environmentally friendly transit options that create equity and also build healthy communities. And I really want to thank Mary and others who testified today about the need to make sure that as we rollout any program or pilot, that we're doing so in direct conversation with communities that could potentially benefit from the creation of scooters, for example, but also that we're taking into consideration all the unintended consequences. And I think creating corrals and making those available for bikes and for scooters in the future help us to proactively respond to theconcerns that we've seen in other cities. We can do that in a way that learns from other cities and how they've been able to move those scooters off the sidewalk and out of the ramps that allow for people to have easy and safe access to our protected sidewalks.And I think that's a critically important for us to create these corrals now so that when we potentially roll out policy in the future, we have a place for these bikes and scooters to go in the future. The other two things that I think are really exciting about us having this conversation, as one Glen mentioned, which dovetailswith, you know, we want there to be more access to bikes and scooters in the future, not to necessarily penalize people for not putting them in the right place by having us not have as much access to those scooters.But we have or sorry to those bikes, but we have to have a place to put those bikes. So creating the the corrals is incredibly important. And then the last thing I'll mention that I'm looking forward to is I think as we create more sound policies like this, it behooves us to take a look at what othercities have done, especially around labor protections. What we saw in the city of Chicago, for example, is that they do not use independent contractors there. They require the companies to have actual workers and employees. So that can help us create more accountability and responsibility in terms of how these companies are both interacting with the built environment andwith the higher labor standards that we'd like to see in our city. So I'm excited about these higher standards that we're putting into place now. I think that it sets us up well to implement best practices from across the country.And I think overall really excited about making sure that we don't just have a point in time check in with key stakeholders, including from disability rights community, but also that we've built into future legislation how we're going to have the stakeholder engagement all along the process to make sure that these corrals and future legislation on transit optionsreally do meet everybody's needs. So thank you so much for taking this up. And let's get scooting. I had to say something like that.Thank you very much, Skinner. Any further questions before we vote on the resolution? We're good. Okay. Those in favor of adopting the resolution. Please vote i i those opposed vote no. The motion carries the resolution. Adopt and show.Sign it. Please read the next agenda item.\nSummary:", "answer": "A RESOLUTION requesting that the Seattle Department of Transportation develop a budget proposal for creating on-street bike and e-scooter parking."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nOkay, I'm on the second slide now. I think you've got numbers now, don't you. On your slides.No, no.Okay. I'm sorry.Just like this. Like less. Okay, great.So this is in Council District eight in the Stapleton neighborhood. I'm moving on to the next slide in the Stapleton statistical neighborhood, as I just said. The location slide shows you that it is in Southeast Stapleton at the intersection of Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard and Havana Street across from Bluff Lake.You can't see Black Lake in this, but southwest of the Denver City jail. So moving on to the request, it is about 0.83 acres or 36,000 square feet. The property itself is vacant. The applicant is requesting the rezoning to redevelop the property into a financial services dental office and hairdresser land use.So the again request is to rezone from r emu 20 with waivers to master planned context, mixed use five stories. So moving on to the current waivers, they relinquish the right to some civic land uses, including gallery, museum, boarding school, university or college.Some commercial land uses including animal sales, banking and financial services, medical or dental office and clinic, and the right to construct offices over 2500 square feet or aggregated over 5000 square feet of office space. So moving on to the context, again, the existing zoning is arm you toe with waivers.There is a Stapleton general development plan in this for the South Area adopted in 2001. The land use is vacant. This property itself is surrounded by residential, small scale residential and some commercial under development now. So looking at the context map zoning, you see that there's marks five to the north, there's mmx5, which is the mixed usezone district where they're applying for to the east and to the south and then to the west. The RMU, Tony, with waivers. Moving on to land use. The surrounding land uses are a mix of low density multi-unit and single family.And the blue on the map that you see on this slide is a daycare center. I would point out that the to the south, the triangular parcel, there are two restaurants underdeveloped there. And just south of our subject site is the site where the new King Soopers is being developed.They're being built just. So looking at building foreman scale, this gives you an idea of the existing buildings in the area. The day care center is the top photo. The the grassy field is the vacant property we're talking about.The lower right photo is some townhomes and single family homes directly across Geneva court from our site. And then all the steel girders in the bottom picture are the King Soopers under under construction. So moving on to process, an informational notice of a complete application went out to City Council and all of the affected renos on March24th. Our planning board held a hearing June 1st on this and was duly noted, duly noticed electronically with a sign posted on the property and planning board voted 9 to 1 to recommend approval. And then we were on to the Land Use Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on August 3rd.They passed this item on to the Council for this public hearing. These are the RINO's that were notified and to date we have no public comment. So review criteria, you're very familiar with consistency with adopted plans, uniformity of district regulations, furthering the excuse me, public health, safety and welfare, justifying circumstances and consistency with neighborhood context and zonedistrict purpose and intent. So the plans that apply to this property plan 2000 Blueprint Denver, the Stapleton Development Plan and the Stapleton redevelopment of the General Development Plan for the South Area adopted in 2001. So what I wanted to get into first was the sort of evolution of the location of this town center site.On the bottom left is the of the town center. Location side is the original location in the Stapleton Development Plan in 1995, which was going to be at 26th Avenue and Havana Street. Then by the time we did the GDP in 2001, the town center had moved slightly north and Martin Luther King, coming in sort of fromthe west in that middle picture, was going to divide and the town center was going to be in the center of that divided Martin Luther King. That was a little north of 26th Avenue. Then by the time we did, too, in 2002, when Blueprint Denver mapped the area, the town center had moved north to Martin Luther Kingand Havana Street, and Martin Luther King had not dipped south to connect to 26th Avenue like that center picture had envisioned. So there has been kind of an evolution of the location of the town center. I should note, though, that when we approved the zoning in 1995 for most of South Stapleton, the GDP very deliberately said thezoning should rule, and that's what we have adhered to since then. The GDP has not been amended. So I can't plan 2000. We have several strategies that we think this application conforms with telling us to promote the development of sustainable communities and centers of activities where shopping jobs, recreation schools are accessible to encourage quality infill development thatoffers opportunities for different densities and amenities to encourage development of focal points in communities where none exist, and to support development of neighborhood serving business centers. So I'm on to Blueprint Denver. Blueprint Denver land use concept is single family residential, and it's an area of change.The single family residential is described as primarily residential, with some complementary land uses such as parks and schools and some employment base that is definitely smaller than the housing base. Future ST Classification and Blueprint Denver. Martin Luther King is a mixed use arterial where we want to provide a high degree of mobility and.These streets are located in our higher intensity mixed use areas. 31st Avenue and Geneva are both under designated local streets. So I'm on to Stapleton Development Plan. This site is in District three in the Stapleton Development Plan. It is a to be an urban neighborhood, moderate density, significant natural amenities, as all of the Stapleton neighborhoods have, andstrong ties to original Aurora as this is directly adjacent to Aurora on the east. So those key elements from that district, from the Stapleton Development Plan, that it's predominantly residential, that it has that district center, town center, that all Stapleton town centers have transportation elements and have either an elementary school or a neighborhood center of some kind. That's the one of the unique elements of this town center is that they they wanted us to develop urban design guidelines for the correctional facility on Smith Road as it's directly adjacent to the north of this area. So moving on to the GDP, the GDP and the mixed use zoning in the chapter, former Chapter 59 required generaldevelopment plans. I'm sorry, the mixed use zoning required general development plans. So the GDP was based in the Stapleton Development Plan. There were 2155 acres in that general development plan, and it was generally shaped as most of Stapleton is, by the open space, walkable neighborhoods, mixed use town centers and neighborhood centers, regional retail and all different varietyof land uses from residential all the way to industrial. And as I said before, specifically, the land use concept laid out in the general development plan, talked about the land uses may change and evolve over time, but would remain consistent with the mixed use zoning.So again, the mixed use zoning, the RSU 20 was put in place. It was primarily residential, but it was along some heavily traveled streets. And the mixed use concept of combining residential and neighborhood serving retail was present in the GDP.So I'm moving on to the land use slide from the general development plan and you see the red circle on the map there. It's a difficult map to read, but it was called residential on the general development plan.And then on the zoning map from the general development plan, we see that the site itself is the arm you tow with waivers zoning. And then the Street Network. I just wanted to point out again that the Street Network for as far as Martin Luther King Boulevard is did not develop the way the general development plan envisionedit. It did not split into two one ways, and it did not go just to the south and join 26th Avenue. It ended up actually pretty much being aligned east and west. So the master plan context under review criteria consistency with neighborhood context and zone district purpose and intent master plan context is intended for large redeveloping areasthat are redeveloping in phases over time. And as I said before, the range of land use is ranged from single unit multi-unit, mixed use, large town centers, small town centers, transit oriented development, commercial, all the way to industrial land uses as we are developing a whole new community and the master plan mixed use zoning is intended toprovide that flexibility for these master plan communities and to respond to market opportunities over time. And the zoning regulations were written to support these phased developments, allowing a variety of developments so it does the master plan mixed use five story does promote new town centers with mixed use neighborhoods that are five stories in height.So with that, staff believes that all of the criteria are met, that this proposal is consistent with the adopted plans, that it furthers the uniformity of district regulations by moving into a standard zone district from a custom zone district that, in adopting in implementing our plans, were furthering the public health, safety and welfare, that the justifying circumstanceof changed conditions has been met, and that this project is consistent with the neighborhood context and zone district purpose and intent. With that, staff recommends approval.Thank you. Miss Lucero, we have one speaker tonight. I'm going to ask that person to make their way forward. Tyler Carlson. You will have 3 minutes. Please introduce yourself.Telecast. I'm a principal at Evergreen Development, so I'm the applicants and don't have a formal presentation. Just want to thank Theresa and staff for her help working through the zoning process. She's been great. And I want to thank the neighbors who are here.We've been working collaboratively with them over the last several months to make sure that the project we're doing here, which is basically a second phase of this bridge town center, is beneficial to them and the rest of the surrounding neighborhood.The impetus behind this request is really to remove the Byzantine waivers that are on it, which preclude financial services and a dental office. And we have leases with both of those use categories and we are leasing to them specifically to keep less intense uses in this buildings or service oriented uses versus the heavy restaurant mix we havein the town center immediately south. So we think this is a win win. It also cleans up the zoning for the overall parcel. And I want to thank everyone for their time and here to answer any questions.Great. Thank you.I also live in Stapleton and I work in the city in county of Denver, too. Sorry.Great. Thank you. All right. That concludes our speakers. Are there any questions for members of council? Councilman Herndon.Thank you, Mr. President. Three To start with you, the planning board. Nine The one who's the one and why?That was Don Elliott, and he had an issue with the location of the town center over time. He didn't.Believe that.Because Blueprint Denver didn't have a town center on the north side of Martin Luther King Boulevard. He didn't believe that this proposal conformed with Blueprint Denver.Okay. Fair enough. And could you go back to the slide where you showed the different zone codes?Yes, let me get to that.And my question is that parcel north of Martin Luther King, it has to zone codes, it has to the east, the x five, which is what the applicant is trying to go to, into the west. It has the RMU.And my question is why that is the case. You would think that that should be either or. And I'm curious why it's split.That's it.That's it?Yeah.Why? There's Army 20 with waivers.Parcel to the north. That's two different zone codes. So they are amused on the west. And then the next five was the applicants trying to go to is to the east. And I don't know if you know why that that is the case.Why in 2010 maybe we didn't write down the Army 20 because it had waivers.Okay.And the one to the north, it doesn't have waivers because it had a site plan that already governed it. So we didn't want to. We also did not reason. Site plan or PBGC, as we call them, plan building groups, because we didn't want to have to take back our approval of a site plan that was already approvedand use.And you said this, but I want to make sure that this is understood. The current zoning right now, the RMU does allow commercial uses.As it's mixed.Use and which commercial uses could and actually actually, Theresa Tyler, I can call you up because I'm sure you've studied this a lot more, Tyler, if you want to come up. Thank you, Theresa. What can the. You don't even have to come here right now.You could have currently bought the property and done what to it. Currently. Yeah. The both categories allow for commercial retail, both allow for drive thru uses, both allow for actually high density residential. The only difference between the two categories is the waivers which limit you preclude you from doing financial services, medical, dental, that list that Theresa provided. I don't know why in the world it is so weird, but anyways, it is what it is and we're trying to remove it. But yeah, you could. The exact same building we're trying to build, you could do the only difference, as I mentioned the neighbors earlier this evening is if this was to not pass the waiver stuck, that I have to backfill my leases with the dentist office in the bank with more restaurants because that's the only the other viable use category and we both don't want to do that. But that's more intense uses by their homes.Correct. And that's why I, I think sometimes when people see are they think residential and I appreciate you bring up that point entirely. One more for you. And since none of them have signed up to speak against, I am assuming and I we've met with them that they are comfortable moving forward.But if you wanted to Tyler one, I appreciate the conversations you've had talking with the neighbors and their concerns and I'll speak a little bit to that during the comment, if you just wanted to talk about how those conversations have gone forward, they've gone great.I mean, it's it's a great group of neighbors who have normal concerns that anyone would have I would have if this was happening across the street from my house. They haven't been relating to the rezoning. It's really related to access.And we've tried to work through that with traffic staff to varying degrees of success, you know, which is a challenge for all of us, because I think we'd all like maybe a different access program than engineering's allowing to occur.But again, that doesn't concern the rezoning. But we continue to you know, we're doing some additional buffers. We're asking to be planting some trees on their side of the street to help mitigate some of the impact. We did something similar when we did the Sprouts on Colfax, where we had similar commercial adjacencies right next to neighborhoods.So we're trying to be good neighbors. And I live not too far away so they know where to find me. Great. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you. Councilman Herndon, Councilman Espinosa, this might be a question for either Teresa or the city attorney. And this question really wouldn't have mattered at the time that it came to plan, Candy. But now that we've approved the linkage fee, if this plan set were to go for permitting after January 1st, is this still covered by theStapleton housing plan or does this now fall under under the linkage fee? And the reason why I'm asking is one of those waivers allows a substantial, considerable more amount of redevelopment on this means of development on this site than the 2500 or 5000 square foot limitation.You know, this is a nearly 40,000 square foot site, TMX five. That's this can be a far more substantial project in what was originally codified.I'll defer to the city attorney.Mr. President? David Broadwell, Assistant City Attorney. The rezoning doesn't affect the fact that the language in the new linkage fee ordinance exempts out the entire Stapleton geographic area by virtue of the fact that it remains under the original development agreement adopted in the in the early 2000.So this rezoning doesn't affect the fact that the applicability of the linkage fee at all, that the the property remains exempt until the development agreement goes away.So why wouldn't we require somewhere in the process that that when we're granting so right now that the entire property parcel that's being redeveloped I mean re zoned has a 5000 square foot commercial limitation. Now obviously under residential, it could be substantially higher than that.But if it were to get developed commercially, every square foot of development in excess of 5000 square feet is in fact now not part of that redevelopment or.If it's an office, is it 5000 square feet?So any commercial use.Commercial uses don't have that.But now we're exempting that for the other waived uses that were so interesting. Yeah. Is that all your questions? Yeah. Okay. All right. Any other questions for members of council? A public hearing for council bill 430 is closed.Councilman Herndon.Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the questions and I appreciate the community from coming out. And this show that I have so few people coming out demonstrates Tyler's ability to work with the neighbors. I am so familiar with this area.If the U.S. went down a little further south, you would have seen my house, my first house at 26 in Fermanagh and 28 when I put down an offer on that. And I remember those signs that talked about the East Ridge Town Center coming and it's finally here and it's really exciting.Those pictures need to be really updated, particularly at the town center because it's coming. And I appreciate I'm excited to see the full parcel north of Martin Luther King as well. And I appreciate Tyler and Evergreen recognizing the community in the sense because as he said, he could have done more active uses where you could have hadrestaurants, where you could have things going on and like 9:00 at 10:00 at night, right across the street from the neighbors. But I think he recognized there's a way to do commercial as well as take the neighbors into consideration.I think that's a testament to you, Tyler, as well as you being a resident and being very familiar with the community. I appreciate neighbors coming through because we have spoken in length about their concerns, not particularly the zoning, but particularly on egress and access.And we've we're continuing to have those conversations. And I, I appreciate you being here. We're going to continue those conversations to make sure we can ensure that you can have your your concerns warranted, as well as making sure that the parcel that's going to be developed can be successful as well, too.So this is something that I, I certainly support. I hope my colleagues will. I, I just find those earlier photos very interesting. I couldn't imagine Martin Luther King dipping down to 26th Avenue now the way that is in those original when you think about how it is now.But this is something I certainly do support and I would encourage my colleagues to do so as well. Thank you, Mr. President.Yeah, thank you, Councilman Herndon. I will say one thing about this, not particularly this development, but I expect Tyler to do well with the neighbors because and in 2012, with the former sunflower site and you mentioned it, but now the sprouts that's on Colfax in a food desert, that was one of the most complex issues in workingwith neighbors. And still to this day, the folks over there are really excited about that grocery store. So I hope this works out for the Stapleton neighborhood as well. We this has been moved in second.

I see a proclamation coming on next July. All right. Thing no other announcements. We're going to move on. There are no presentations. There are no communications. We do have two proclamations this evening. Councilman Brooks, will you please read Proclamation 892?Mr. President, it would be an honor to read that. I appreciate the time in front of the dais here. Proclamation 1889 to recognize the annual Brothers Redevelopment and Denver Employee Volunteer Opportunities Paint a thon in the city of Denver on Saturday, August 18, 2018.Whereas, through the Partnership of Denver Employees Volunteers Opportunities, we call it Devo and Brothers Redevelopment Inc. 100 plus Denver city employees will volunteer their time to paint homes of deserving senior Homeowners for Brothers Redevelopment Inc 40th paint a thon.And. Whereas, all painting will be completed free of charge from homeowner homeowners, saving the city's fixed income seniors thousands of dollars in home maintenance costs. And. Whereas, volunteers will be beautifying homes and preserving home values in Denver area neighborhoods as a result of their participation.And. Whereas, The Paint a thon is a great way to show that city employees take pride in the community and take care of the residents. And. WHEREAS, the paint a thon truly makes a difference in the lives of Denver's residents.Now, therefore, be a proclaimed of the city and county of Denver. Section one. The Denver City Council recognizes the day of August 18, 2018, as Brothers Redevelopment incorporate on day in the city and county of Denver. In Section two of the clerk in the city and county, Denver shall attest in affixed a seal of the city andcounty of Denver to this proclamation, and that a copy be transmitted to the Deveaux board.Thank you, Councilman Brooks. Your motion to enact.Yes, I move that 892 proclamation 89 to be adopted.It has been moved and seconded comments by members of council. Councilman Brooks.Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm always honored to, uh, to bring this proclamation forward. I think Brothers redevelopment does an excellent job there. You know, Jeff, I was looking for you. Jeff Martinez, CEO, does an excellent job of taking care of elders in our community and and doing the hard work to ensure that financing is in placefor affordable housing for those residents as well. And, you know, Jeff and I met each other when I first got elected. And there are several affordable housing, senior affordable housing units that needed to be attended to. And, you know, you work with a lot of nonprofits and organizations who let's just say Jeff gets it and he caresabout the community. And it was it's been such a blessing to have someone who understands the community and cares about it. And I last year next door to me, one of my neighbors who's been living in the whole neighborhood for 46 years, got her house painted.And so I got to see firsthand what that did. And what you don't know, Jeff, is that, you know, our neighbor lost her husband didn't lose. You know, he didn't he didn't die. But he was he's in prison and is not able to help out around the house.And so her house is falling into shambles. And when you all came and there's a whole team of folks from the business community and from the community painting and helping out. I mean, she had tears in her eyes.And you can never measure the impact that you're having on some of these elderly folks in our community. And so this is just incredible. And also, I want to point out that brothers redevelopment is part of. The Land Trust that received $2 million from Seedat to invest in affordable housing.And I can tell you right now, it's great that the GSA coalition came together and got $2 million, the most money towards affordable housing from any community group in divorce history. But it wouldn't be possible if it wasn't because the brothers redevelopments all have anything but good things to say about this.And I'm excited about the number of seniors in our community who are going to be touched by this. So thank you for what you guys do. Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilman Brooks. Councilwoman Ortega.Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to make sure that my name was added to this proclamation and just. State. What an incredible organization Brothers has been. They're one of the long standing nonprofit development organizations that's been in our city for almost 40 years, maybe even in excess of 40 years.Started by Manny Martinez, who lived in West Denver, and Joe Huron, who was originally from my dad's hometown of Trinidad, Colorado. And, you know, it's great to see that it's an organization that is still around doing incredible things because we have seen some of our nonprofit housing groups that have.That that no longer exist. And so to know that they not only continue to develop housing, but have continued this annual pain to fund program, it's been amazing. I've had the opportunity to participate and it's a lot of hard work.But you know, the families who benefit are so grateful for volunteers coming out and assisting them with the improvements that they probably otherwise would never be able to afford to do on their own. So I just want to thank them for their ongoing work in our city.Thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Great organization, awesome event and excited to support with that. Madam Secretary.Raquel Brooks. Clark. Espinosa. Flynn. AI Gilmore. Herndon. Cashman. Kenny. New Ortega. Sussman Black. Mr. President.I. Madam Secretary, please close voting and note the results. 1212 by proclamation 892 has been adopted. Councilman Brooks, is there someone you'd like to invite up to the podium to receive the proclamation?Yes. The man, the myth, the legend, the CEO, Jeff Martinez. Please come to the. I mean, I thought everybody's going to clap and, like, give it up. And I was like, so. It's so underwhelming. I'm sorry, Jeff, but there it is.Okay, good. There you go. Thank you. Thanks. Council President Clark and members of the City Council. You all did the best job of promoting the paint a thon than I could ever do. You just that testimony that you both shared as is so true.So right on. And that's the way, you know, so many volunteers feel after having painted a home for a deserving senior homeowner in our community, and of which there have been so many over the past decade, 12, 14 years.This is Chad LeBlanc, our volunteer manager, who gets up there and coordinates our volunteers every year. And this is that the Saturdays would be such a tremendous opportunity again to work alongside City of Denver. Employees got about 400 City of Denver employees that are going to be out on those ladders throughout the city on Saturday.And you're going to see them impacting every one of your districts, every one of your neighborhoods, from Ruby Hill to my neighborhood. Park Hill, Chaffey Park, Berkeley to Cold Whittier, Montebello, Overland. So we're going to be all over the city volunteering and you're going to have some great events.So we'll try to push our volunteers, their events when they're done on those ladders, helping our seniors. But it is a tremendous effort. We're so grateful, thankful that this is James who's come on up, James. He's working to bring up the Bring Together the City of Denver volunteers with Deveau this year.And again, just such a tremendous opportunity to work alongside the city employees in this effort.Yeah. Hi. Like he mentioned, I'm. My name is James Warren. I work as a judicial assistant over in the county court. I'm also on the board.For Devo Denver Employee Volunteer.Opportunities. As the name might imply. Our goal is to bring Denver employees into volunteer opportunities. We are. Our board is made up from people around the city, not just the county court, the public library, Denver Human Services, and the people who come to our events, our volunteers, our city employees, as well as their family and friends.For us on the board of Devo and I know for the other employees of the city and county of Denver, Civic Service doesn't just stop when we set our office. We have a sense of civic duty that goes beyond 9 to 5.Devo serves to promote the opportunities.That those people hope for.That those people look for to serve their city on a deeper level. And paying a fine is no exception. If anything, it is actually our biggest event of the year. No surprise with that. For the past 40 years, Brothers redevelopment has been and a central asset in the lives of the people.Of Denver, particularly.Some of the more vulnerable citizens of fixed income seniors in our community. But in our partnership with them, which has been going on since 2004, we've been able to dedicate thousands of volunteer hours. Last year we painted our 100th home and we've been able to save.The.People of this city.The.Fixed income seniors of the city, hundreds of thousands of dollars in costs. I think when people see volunteers from the city and county of Denver who work for the city in kind of Denver out painting homes or doing any of the other volunteer projects that we have throughout the year, they're able to see something that makes thissuch an amazing place that something that makes Denver an amazing place to call home. I think when you see civic spirit, civic service go far beyond the workplace and extend into the community and to service in that way, you get a sense of what sets us apart as a city.And so we're excited to continue our partnership with the city of Denver, with TiVo and with with Brothers redevelopment this Saturday and in many years to come.I hope to see all the letters with us this Saturday. You want to know where any of those sites are? Just feel free to give us a call and then we'll set you up to go out and visit those hardworking volunteers that are going to be on ladders, paint those homes this weekend.So thank you so much. We appreciate you and can do without you.Thank you. Thank you. All right. For our next proclamation, Councilwoman Ortega, will you please read proclamation eight, nine, eight?\nSummary:", "answer": "A proclamation recognizing the annual Brothers Redevelopment and Denver Employee Volunteer Opportunities Paint-A-Thon Day in the City and County of Denver on Saturday, August 18, 2018."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nReport from Development Services Recommendation to declare ordinance amending the Long Beach Municipal Code relating to planned unit developments. Read in adopted as read.District eight. Councilman Andrews. I'm sorry, Councilman Austin.I moved this part.Thank you. Public comment, please.For what it's worth, Lorie Angel. I live at 458 East Street addressing our representatives of the public. One thing I did want to mention that is I did go through the city council video last week, and part of the basis for approving the project was the fact that the residents were in favor of it.Well, there were 30 speakers, 31 speakers. 14 of the speakers lived in the neighborhood. Six were for it and eight were against it. And of the total speakers it was 2 to 1 against and we didn't bring a bus.So my concern. Is not. Even the issue that we push this thing through when it isn't really all as favorable as it's being lit up to be, is that the concept of a PUD is included in this ordinance and it hasn't been discussed anywhere except in the context of the Riverwalk.The public hasn't had a chance to weigh in. And not only that is what it says in this ordinance is already in direct conflict to the one project that you have in the books. It says that it has to have a driveway.Well, the Riverwalk doesn't have a driveway. So what happens now? They don't have any driveways. Is that okay? Does that get vetted anywhere? Is there. I mean, where the process is really fouled up here? Has anything gone through the planning commission, as they said, that, oh, you have a variance, you don't have to have a driveway andmaybe that doesn't matter. I know everybody's tired, so let's just go home and just vote yes. I mean, this is a problem. It's an issue. You're creating something that's going to have an impact on neighborhoods henceforth. And also the ordinance just looks at APD within the context of itself.It doesn't even have reference to anything outside of it, except if a river runs through it or a street runs through it. Well, what about the impact to everything outside of APD? It's not even addressed. This ordinance is not ready to be passed.Thank you.Next speaker, please.Joe Weinstein again. Oh. Like the other speakers, I have to point out that this this was not properly noticed. To the extent that it could have been said to be noticed at all. It was put in such a way that you wouldn't notice it.Mind you, the last of several resolutions that appear to pertain to all of two parcels in one district of the city, and suddenly something that applies to land use throughout the city. This is patently against the spirit, if not the law of due notice.It's so totally anti transparent. But then let's look at the actual. Zoning option that's provided. It was a. It was a straw man question that people allegedly asked whether this would change zoning anywhere else. No, it doesn't. But it provides options.And what kind of option does it provide? Essentially, it essentially an anything goes. If you have five acres, you can put any you can ask for any number of units on that acreage. It's true. They all have to fit within.There's only a certain number of lots per acre, but you can pile several dwelling units within a single lot and there's essentially no limit. Impost. What you have then therefore is in place of a son of cracker box, which some people derisively referred to this.It's not a son of cracker box. It's a clan of cracker walks. And in fact, the way you try to put it over, it's a clandestine of clan of cracker box. And basically the more honest way to do this is to go to Houston.Houston has got a problem. No zoning. That's honest. This, in effect, says Houston, we want your problem. Thank you.And Cantrell last week when it was pointed out that this PUD would affect. Development in other parts of the city are. We were told. No, that's not right. This is only for. Riverwalk. I'd like to read what the staff report says.Use of R one and development standards are not consistent with a new large subdivision or the current goals and objectives with enhanced site planning, unit designs and community amendments. Staff therefore proposes to create a planned unit development PWD zoning district that could be used for this and other similar large scale residential projects currently in the development pipelineor on potential infill sites on suitably large lots. Therefore, this could be used in any one of your districts in the city. It could be used for the city college property. In the fifth district on los coyotes and wardlow.It could be used for c dip in the third district. It could be used any place. There's still five acres left to cram in a large development and create. Density. I'm wondering if you even read the staff reports.Because I can't see how you could vote for something like this without allowing the public to know that this is what is going to happen in their city. True, the developers will still have to go through, get their permits and go through planning and come to you for your blessing on their developments.But now they have the ability to ask for 13 houses per acre where before they did not have this ability. You are changing the whole zoning of the city. Think carefully.My name is Richard Ivey, and I'd like to echo the comments that have been spoken here earlier. It was very anti transparent. It looked like it was only relating to River Walk. It was hidden in a bunch of other items.And it applies to the whole city.I don't think people are aware of the impact that this items had. Normally we have hearings.We have opportunity for input. We have. Public meetings. Throughout throughout the city. We've.Looked at zoning and our resident are. Things that we've wanted to and ways that we've wanted.To develop our our community.And. And this.Just totally overrides all of that. I think that down the road we will look and look back at this and say, this is what?We'll have the beginning of a very.Big change in our city that will not have good effects. Thank you.Next speaker, please.Hello again. I think I'm very fortunate. At least I have an advantage that I. I was able to speak to the planning department before I came to this meeting, and I spoke to this lady at length. So. I do know that there's been a lot of things that's been vetted in the within the city, and I thinkMs.. Mungo's office for at least putting me in touch with these people. But I will admit that this is very difficult language for the average person to kind of understand what's taking place. And I am going to kind of echo what they're saying, but not quite, you know.I will admit that that yeah, this, this, this pussy pudi where the zone is going to increase the density for sure and. Trying to stay on the same subject that I have been. There's going to also be a lot of.Uh. Um. Water usage coming from there and what, 161 people, something like that that's going to be in this unit. They're going to be sucking up a lot of water. And it's going to be more than even the parts that we supposedly made a memo against because they were using water.So we got a little bit of a contradiction in that respect. But I also want to echo what Incontrol was saying regarding this. Many of these there's many zones in Long Beach that it intends to have an institutional zone.And this is going to just make it a little bit easier for the for the. The developers are going to look for these type of things and they're going to they're going to do their best to use this as a template for stamping this thing out.And that's really kind of more the fear that I have is that, you know, we have this land, the property that Encontro mentioned is near my house and it has been tried before it was fought off. Gosh, I don't know, maybe ten, 12 years ago.I mean, I've been in Long Beach in this area for 50 years at least, you know. And so this is kind of somebody left their pin up. Um, this is kind of on. We're having a lot of difficulty.How do you prevent? Is it possible for maybe a council person to say, look, this isn't even though we might be able to choose, can we leave this? This is going to designate this as a like a blue area or something just to let a developer know that it's been marked that way.I mean, I don't know. There might be a suggestion, but we also probably need a map. To locate the different areas that this other developers might choose. At least make that available for people to kind of vet so the council people can bring it out to their public to in fact that so.That's why I have to say good luck.

Report from City Clerk recommendation to receive and file a presentation from the Los Angeles Registrar Recorder County Clerk relative to the November 3rd, 2020. General Municipal Elections Citywide. A Vice Mayor here to assist us with the presenting information on the November general election is Monica Flores, government and legislative affairs manager for theLos Angeles Registrar Court county clerk.Good evening. This is Monica Flores. Thank you for having me. I've mentioned I'm the manager of governmental legislative affairs with the county's registrar recorder's office. And today I will be providing a quick overview of how long before voters voted in March, as well as how our preparations are going for the November election.Next slide, please. One more. In May I present the findings of our analysis of the March election to your Election Oversight Committee. A few questions were raised during that meeting and then were asked for me to come here to present to your full council and some of these details in the March election.We found that 35% of Long Beach voters voted in person and 65% of your voters actually voted via mail. 22% of those in-person voters voted during the first ten days of the voting period. And the busiest voting centers in your city were Eldorado Park West, Bayshore Community Congregation Church and the Panamerican Park.You can see here in the presentation the number of voters that voted at each one of these locations. Next five things. One more. So we are now well on our way with the preparations for the November general election.And as all things in our lives, the election will look very different than any of the elections we have seen before. To begin, all voters will be issued a vote by mail ballot. This is a 2.5 million ballot increase over what was mailed in the county for the primary election.This was done by initially by a board motion supported by a governor's executive order and then legislation that was passed in the state. We have also expanded our vote by mail drop boxes to 400 that will be placed across the county.This is an increase from approximately 250 that were placed in the for the March election. Additionally, the number of centers that we will be deploying in the county will change. For this election, we will have 11 days of voting, so a ten day early voting period and we will have 75 sites open for 11 day and 725of the sites open for five days for a total of 800 sites open throughout L.A. County. Additionally, we have implemented a safe election plan which incorporates the state and county code with guidelines to ensure safety at our vote centers.Next slide. Our priorities in this election are the safety and security of our voters and election workers. We seek to maximize vote by mail options and participate participation. We are looking to align the capacity to the highest expected volume and to predictive analytics, so placing the resources in the right place.We are looking to market voting events to encourage early voting. We will be targeting our mobile and flex programs to address geographically isolated areas and voters who have historically faced barriers to access. Additionally, we will be placing these types of sites at locations that have a lot of essential workers, such as hospitals, to ensure that those essentialworkers have the opportunity to vote. We are looking to implement and communicate a broad mass media campaign and voter education campaign to encourage our voters to plan ahead and to make sure they know all of their options for voting.Like. This. Here is a list of the vote centers that we have confirmed for Long Beach for the November election. In your city, we have 29 confirmed sites and we are currently either assessing or negotiating a few more sites, just about another handful.You may notice that some of the sites used in March are not on this list due to COVID social distancing guidelines. We need larger spaces for our vote centers. This means that some of the sites used in March did not meet the new requirements.We will be finalizing this list within the next week and I will share that list of both centers in Long Beach with your city clerk, Monique, who can pass this information along. Additionally, the vote center lists will be shared with all our voters, as we did in March.We will be sending a booklet that lists all of the vote centers in the county to every household in L.A. County. Next slide, please. This. Here is a list of the drop boxes that will be in Long Beach.We have 18 box boxes secured. Some of these boxes are still being installed, but all will be installed by October 5th, which is the date which all the boxes must open. Voters will receive information on these drop boxes within their vote by mail packet.In that packet they will have a list of their nearest locations, and then they can also find that all of the drop boxes on our website as they count the votes centers. We did receive one more request for a Dropbox and we are currently in Longreach and we are currently looking at our inventory and the spacing ordistribution of boxes to see if that box really adds value to the Long Beach boaters. So this list might grow by one or two more. Next slide. As I mentioned, we have established a safe presidential election plan to keep our voters and election workers safe at our vote centers.This plan complies with state and county guidelines. So to begin, as I mentioned, all voters will be mailed a vote by mail ballot. We will encourage our voters to stay home and use their ballots, but we will offer in-person voting.The in-person voting will implement social distancing throughout the whole process, from the line to casting the ballot. We will ask voters to wear a face covering, and we will have masks and gloves available for voters who request them.Hand sanitizer will be available upon entry and exit and on other key stations throughout the vote center. Our election workers will wear protective gloves and masks, and all of the devices will be sanitized between our after after voters.Finally, curbside voting will be available for any voters who do not have a mask or refuse to wear a mask, or for any voter who is just unable to enter the vote center. Next slide. The timeline or key dates for this election.September 24th, we will be mailing sample ballot booklets. October 5th, we will begin the mailing of vote by mail ballots. This is also the date that our drop boxes open and the date that early voting begins here in Norwalk at the RCC headquarters.Next important deadline is October 19th, and that is the end of voter registration. The voter is not registered by this date. We will not be mailing a vote by mail ballot. They do have the opportunity to register in person at a vote center if they still wish to do so.Our vote centers will open on October 24. The hours of operations are 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., except for the final day of voting, which is the 7 a.m. m to 8 p.m.. That's fine. And this is my quick overview of what we have coming into Long Beach as we continue to secure vote centers and drop boxes. Like I said, I will communicate with your city clerk, move money, and I will pass on information as well about election worker recruitment and training. And then my final comment is, is to thank you, your council and your city clerk money.Thank you all for your support. You have been great partners in this. You really assisted us in overcoming challenges that we have seen due to COVID, and our department truly appreciates that. Thank you.Thank you very much. I do have anybody coming in this item. Yes, we have Tiffany Davey.Good evening, Mayor. Council residents of Long Beach and Stephanie Darby, fourth district resident. I want to thank Monica Forest so much for that really in-depth presentation. And I just want to highlight a couple of reflections actually following this presentation, coupled with the presentation she gave to the Election Oversight Committee on May 26.So just speaking to Howie, just a couple of reflections during this crucial transition to the voting solutions for all people and vote center model. Having served in elections for the past 12 years, I make the following advertisements. Having served as well in the 2020 primaries, L.A. County has 20 you know, 27% of the voters take part invoting in the ten days prior to Election Day, with the remaining 73% of voters taking place on Election Day. With that, a couple of issues arise. Address with the disproportion of previous polling places. L.A. County previously to voting model had 5000 polling places.But with implementation of this up, we had in that primary 978 I believe the report stated. With the new system, it also allows any resident of L.A. County to vote at any vote center, which I am a strong opponent and supporter of.Access to the polls, as every person has a right to vote, should exercise that right part of the way to serve the public. However, that dissatisfied 20% and the aforementioned wait times are resulting up to 2 hours kind of reflects that squeeze towards.73% voting at 20% over the previous amount of polling places. So I just want to take this opportunity to really encourage all voters to take part in early voting. As Monica stated in the report, polling places will be open from October 24th, October 5th, on vote by mail boxes will be open, really take advantage of those dates. We saw very few voter turnout as again reflected with the percentage. So, again, let's remember a couple of other things really quickly. California's a no I.D. state, so please, to ease whatever we may face on Election Day, please remember the election staff will advise you on whether or not you need to show ID, as there are someexceptions to that rule. Again, we do not need to see your ID unless you are asked to do so. Thank you in advance to all of our nation's poll workers and disaster service workers as we are facing this continued ongoing pandemic.And I look forward to us taking care of each other as a nation. Thank you, everyone. Have a good evening.Thank you. That concludes public comment. Thank you. Do we have any further comment on this item? We just finished that. Okay. Do we have any council phones? You know, I do not have any council phones, so you see, it's so good.Keep it up. You know, I'm going to go down in order, you know. So the council comments. So District one.Thank you, Vice Mayor. I just wanted to say thank you very much for that great presentation. I know that this is a challenging time for everyone, and I just want to say thank you and thank you to our city clerk's office for the amazing work that they do.And I look forward to seeing all their great work be shown on November 3rd and before that so when elections happen. Thank you so much. Very supportive of this. Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor. Thank you so much for joining us and presenting today.I think as I mentioned earlier in the council meeting, civic engagement and voter turnout is very critical not only for statewide measures, but local measures and just ensuring that our residents feel like they're engaged and that their vote matters.We know that there when we're talking about inequalities in our city, we know that different demographics in our city vote higher than others. And sometimes that's related to multiple jobs, maybe childcare situation, maybe not being able to get to the polls in time.So I hope that every constituent that is able to vote in this election knows that they will be getting a vote by mail ballot and that they can vote before the final Election Day. And so I really appreciate having the time to talk about this with the council.I appreciate the partnership with the county. Thanks so much.Disagree. District four.Thank you for an excellent presentation.Thank you. Second District by. It seven. Again. It's my honor. And I want to thank the staff for the great presentation. Very important that we get out the vote and that we make it as easy as possible to submit the vote.One question in regards to the drop boxes, are they secured?Yes, the drop boxes are secured, so the drop boxes are actually bolted to the ground. They are a material that is has been tested to be very difficult to destroy. The boxes themselves are also locked in during periods that are not voting periods.And can you give an example of when a person would be required to show ID?Sure. There's really in one instance, there were an individual's required to provide an ID, and that is when it is a new voter who when they registered, we were unable to verify them in the state database. And that is usually either because they didn't provide either the last four digits of their social or a California driver's licensenumber. So very small instances, but there are opportunities. So I appreciate a council member bringing that up.And finally, will there be literature going out to the voting public in regards to the information we provided tonight?Yes. So we have already sent out two mailers to every registered voter. The first one was an address verification postcard, really informing voters to to ensure that their postcard is verified. It was affordable by us. So if you move but didn't notify us, then you would return that ballot with that postcard with the new address.We also sent out a postcard asking any voter who's interested in updating the language in which they receive their material to let us know. And then the other pieces of mailers that will be sent out are, as usual, the sample ballot, the vote by mail packet.But then they will also be receiving that information within that booklet that I mentioned that lists all the vote centers. And then voters will also be receiving a postcard listing their nearest vote centers, as they did in March.So all of those mailers are opportunities for us to communicate with the voters, and they will have messaging that includes this information that I shared. Additionally, we are kicking off our mass media campaign this week. So beginning tomorrow you should see us all over social media, over traditional media.We will be out of home. So billboards, even in signage, in supermarkets, locations that we know voters are frequently that these days. So radio, local publications and so forth. So a lot of messaging will begin tomorrow.Thank you very much, everybody. It's. Mr. Gay. Disegno.Sure. Thank you. Just thought, first of all, thank you. The president. This is a big election. There's a lot of changes. One thing I wanted to. One thing I wanted to raise during the primary. We would have a number of vote centers, Colin Powell, a local church and smothered in the North Lombard area.And Colin Powell, although there was a lot of space, a lot of empty voting booths. A lot of people knew about it. It was hard to. It's it's on the edge of the town and it's hard to access.And at the time, our regional park out in park was under construction. And so that's our regional park. That's where everyone goes. That's right in the heart of North Long Beach. And and now it's open. The training center's done.I wonder, is it you mentioned you're considering additional voting center locations. I think Highland Park makes more sense in the 95 zip code, given it's the largest zip code in the city and it's smack dab in the middle and it's accessible from all directions.What needs to happen in order to make Highland Park a vote center?Thank you, Councilmember, for that recommendation. Let me take this back and look at it. I will definitely. If the park wasn't open, maybe it just wasn't fully on our radar and we didn't consider it as we assess locations.But I have made note of this and we'll we'll go back to our team to see if we can immediately send out an assessment team to assess the location and, if possible, work out an agreement with the facility.And I can work with City Clerk Moni to to secure the location.That that works. I think it works a lot better. There's a fresh new parking lot turning loop, the 30,000 square foot facility with lots of open space so you can social distance. I just think it makes a lot more sense in that space.Thank you for for looking into it and I'll keep in contact. Thanks.Thank you.Bye. And you have a motion in second on this place.Emotions and dangers.Second Richardson.Thank you very much, Greg. Please take a vote.District one. I district to.My.District three.High.School.

Good. Okay. This is an item that we've worked on with staff, with Tom Modica and the team. And so I look forward to having you guys bring these back. My my priority out of all of these would be the parking impacted areas.Looking at the parking zone. I know my brain is not working. Maybe it is late, huh? Give me 1/2.I just been district.Yes, thank you. The parking assessment district. How soon do you think we could initiate that?Ask Linda Tatum to talk to that.Thank you.Councilwoman Pierce, we can get started on some of the preliminary research for that. But ultimately, in order to create a parking assessment district, we'd have to do some some studies to see how exactly what the fees could be to charge the property.So I'm going to say that would take several months to do that. But on some of the other items, and I understand that that's your priority, but some of the other items on that list that was in the staff report.We can certainly get started on some of those a lot quicker and come back sooner and concurrently. While we're taking a look at the the process and the potential fees for the property owners to create the parking and the process to create that parking assessment district.Okay. And the good news here, Councilmember, is there is some funding associated with this so that this is not one that's looking for new funds. $175,000. That does come as part of the successor agency. So as the properties are getting sold, that money goes to that account as per the settlement.So we'll be tapping into that as those funds become available.Great. The other one that I think would have a huge impact that seems like low hanging fruit that I'm curious on. The timeline is the private parking. I know that we've talked about different ways of doing this. And, you know, if you take the lot that's at fourth and cherry and it's got the one meter and peoplecan pay to park there. I know that we have a list in my office of businesses that are willing to open up their lots. We just need a streamline process to do that. What's the timeline? You think we could have a city policy on on how to do that.On that process? We are coordinating with economic development. They've actually started that effort as well in terms of talking to some of the private property owners in the process to get those lots open up through those private property owners for for public parking.When they are, say, closed for the night. Those are some of the things that are currently in process. And I'd say the timeline would probably be within 60 days.60 days. I love it, really. I just want to thank staff for their hard work. I know that this has been a long process and I know that we worked over a couple of months to get this. And so I really I know I pushed really hard to get it and then I didn't agenda it right away. So again, I think you there's this one area that I really appreciated your efforts on. Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Gonzales.Thank you so much. And I was forgotten on this item, just so you know. I'm just kidding. That's okay. As the other half of downtown, I just really want to thank Councilmember Pearce for bringing this forward as a supplement to the the study that we had already done.I know there's a lot of areas and gaps that we still need to fulfill and see where there's room to to succeed in parking. So thanks so much for bringing it forward. And thank you, Linda.Thank you.Public comment on this item, saying now there's a motion and a second, please cast your votes.\nSummary:", "answer": "Recommendation to request City Manager to begin implementation on priority areas identified in the Downtown Parking Study and report on the progress of those initiatives."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nArts and culture and early childhood stalking numbers 0504 Message In honor authorizing the city of Boston to accept and expand the amount of $40 million in the form of a grant awarded by the United States Department of the Treasury to be administered by the city of Boston's Chief Financial Officer.Collect the Treasury.

The Chair recognizes Council Board Chair of the Committee on Boston's COVID 19 Recovery Council. BLOCK You have the floor.So much, Mr. President, and I'm going to speak to these dockets in reverse order just because 504 is a little bit simpler. 504 is a docket. The American Rescue Plan Act makes provision for local governments to receive this funding directly, as Boston did, and to use some of it to just replace government revenues in places where revenueswent down because of the pandemic. In Boston, that happened in particular in our departmental revenues and things like hotel excise taxes, meals, taxes, etc. there there's also a series of deferral provisions for a lot of those. So in in but in the budget books in the city produce, there's is sort of documentation of the ways in whichthose resources are off where they would have been without the pandemic. And so related to that provision, the city the mayor proposed this $40 million docket, which is actually there to balance on the revenue side, the budget that we were just discussing and voting on.And so it is it is an important docket to making sure that we actually meet the Commonwealth's obligation for the city of Boston to have a balanced budget for the fiscal year that starts in two days. And so because of that, I'm going to be moving out of committee and recommending passage.Um, and so I know we'll get to that vote in a moment. The other docket, it's 503 is the proposal from Mayor Wu for the expenditure of the rest of the ARPA. Funds that were sent to the city is general revenue and it's first 349.5 million.And as folks know, it came in at the same time as the budget. And the investments that are focused in this docket have been the subject of a lot of conversation, both in the budget process in which they came up again and again as, Oh, what, we're not doing our budget, but we're able to do that onour budget, etc. And then within our committee we've had eight hearings and five working sessions to hear from the public. My colleagues in the administration on this proposal, the largest part of the proposal, 206 of the $349.5 million is for housing and is then is subdivided into a number of sub dockets related to supportive housing to homeownership, a record 60 million investment in this docket, along with some other city funds in homeownership, creating housing on public land, something that's very near dear to me and just like a large number of things. And then another 150 is split between these categories of climate, arts and culture, economic inclusion, child care, a $15 million investment, and reallyhaving the city lead a real renovation of our child care system with an eye to trying to drive better reimbursement rates and policies in the state as the state takes that up in the coming session. Um, and so a lot of good things in here and as the council's held.Hearings on that. I think there's been a lot of things that have come to the fore that we've been talking about. At the same time, the feeling of the body, I think it's safe to say, was a sense of frustration that we had not had the opportunity as a council to formally talk about things that we'd liketo do with this transformative money. Ahead of the proposal by the mayor side to utilize all 249.5. And so there were a lot of great ideas that councilors were also bringing to the table that were not included in the proposal as files.And so that's something that at our committee we've tried to make space for along the way. We started we in late April suggested that folks start filing dockets related to things that they'd like to see us talk about for ARPA.We noticed those dockets with a series of hearings on different topic areas. So, you know, a number of those were noticed and discussed. And then more recently, we also we also invited folks to file amendments and discuss those and in recent working sessions.Well doing that as the chair was also sort of talking to the administration about the question of whether the revenue support docket that they had kind of reserved for next fiscal year. So not the one that we're discussing that starts in two days, but the one a year from now, whether they really needed to be holding quiteas much as they had proposed, not least because of sort of the the trends. When you look at how those departmental revenues and excise revenues have been recovering, I think that we're all super, super mindful of the fact that this recovery money is meant to be spent to help the people of Boston recover and help the cityrecover in a more equitable way and that the need is urgent. So throughout this ARPA process, we've really been balancing the fact that this the need is urgent. And now and all of these things are things that we should have spent money on yesterday.It feels like. And also, even though it's a lot of money, we've all spent it over ten times in our head. And at the same time, because it's a once in a generation kind of amount of money, we want to make sure that we're spending it well and that the that ten years from now we'll be talkingabout the things that we achieved because of ARPA. And so. Basically the administration ultimately said that they were willing to put most of that money that the 19.7 that they had saved for next year's revenue support in to collaboration with the council.And so there's a $17.7 million docket, which I'm not formally speaking to yet because the late file. So it will come. But I think folks have it on their desks already, which is which demonstrates their willingness to be collaborative with the council and include a huge number of council priorities in the city's ARPA proposal.Additionally, within the committee report, which I filed, there are a number of amendments to their proposal which spell out $12.3 million worth of funds within the three 49.5 that are going to be dedicated to specific council priorities that came up in the process, that sort of aligned with the subject areas that they had already, that they hadalready highlighted. And so the description of those changes for this docket is in the summary of legislation and amendments is on page two if people look at the committee report. But I'm just going to read them aloud so that people are aware it will be within this docket, dedicating at least $8 million in category affordable housing tocreating a pathway to four to affordable homeownership for low and moderate income residents, including a new partnership with the Boston Housing Authority, dedicating at least 1.1 million within the category of affordable housing to support a new pilot model in the style of rapid rehousing to help returning citizens secure housing opportunities.So that's another exciting new pilot, 100,000 for the to expand the Peace Institute's work and sort of emergency housing for families for families victims of violence. A million. And here is for a study to figure out if there's somewhere to be land in south Boston to say veterans housing $1,000,000 within the category of behavioral health to supportfurther behavioral health, capacity building and training for CBOs and city departments. $1,000,000 for supporting the recovery of restaurants and bars in disadvantaged neighborhoods. The city particularly focused on sort of folks who kind of missed the opportunities in a number of the programs that were available at the height of the pandemic.And then another million split between 350 in economic opportunity and inclusion. And 650 in arts and culture to support investment in and activation of an arts corridor in Roxbury. Those things collectively add up to the 12.3. That is within this three $49.5 million docket for council priorities.There's then, as I just mentioned, another 17.7 million folks have on their desk. And I'll speak to that when it's formally the right time, when it's the late file. But those two things collectively, obviously add up to $30 million that that reflect council priorities and integrating those into the proposal of how to use the remainder of ARPA. I just also want to draw folks quick attention to at the last page, the committee report. It says. Additionally, the amended version of the order adds language to specify the shared intention to support both worker cooperatives and sustainable pay increases in the childcare sector.Those are some of the kind of qualitative things that have come up in the discussion about this transformative $15 million investment in child care. And then and then just raising, you know, worker standards and making sure that we've got good, good standards across the board and in the areas that are being funded by that order.So that is the document for us. I know as Chair that it's a hard thing to figure out how to take action on something that feels as momentous as this does. And I have definitely felt acutely the fact that it is both too ambitious to do wrong and also too much to do slowly.Because the reality is that the lion's share of the funding is proposed for housing. People know that I come out of the affordable housing world working for the VHA. Unfortunately, housing development and especially building units as for example, 45 million of the 60 million in the homeownership will be doing takes time and has extended timelines.And this money all needs to be under contract by December 2024, which may seem soon, but is not on that type of timeline. And one of the things we heard was that the the annual kind of RFP process that kicks out our our housing resources and helps us let people know what's available.Usually hits in July. And so for for me as chair, it's been a fine balance of trying to figure out how to make sure that councilors have real fingerprints on this, which I think in this $30 million we do, recognizing also a lot of alignment with the other things of the administration have proposed and also making surethat we get these dollars out to our our communities and to all. The urgent needs in our communities because we hear about those every day. I want to acknowledge before you, the Florida colleagues, that, you know, the administration ended up taking a firm position that they did not want to use ARPA dollars to fund nonprofit infrastructure projects. So infrastructure that's going to be owned by private, nonprofit entities. And certainly as chair, that was not something that I'd heard from them early in this process. And I think a number of councilors and organizations brought really meritorious proposals forward to us.And those are not ultimately included in this, unlike the process that the public just was watching, the appropriation accept and expand orders cannot be overridden by the council. So this is a place where we and the mayor have to reach a point of agreement and collaboration.And I think with these two dockets, not completely, but in large part we're doing that today. And so I ask my colleagues to support passage of this. I'm grateful to the administration for filing the the late supplemental order.And I'll also be moving passage of that later in the meeting. Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you. Council balked that she recognizes. Councilman here. Councilman, here. You have the floor.Thank you, Chair. I just need some clarity before I vote on anything. If you're saying that you're going to talk about something else later, I just. I'm just curious about. I know we spent a lot of time talking about very specific things.And and for the record, I'd like to make sure that the things that we have agreed upon are read into the record and that there is some sort of agreement on some of the things that we've been pushing for, because there tends to be this, you know, we didn't know that this was going to be the wayit was when we were dealing with the interdepartmental conversation that the administration. So we you know, now it's like the administration switched it up, but we can't support nonprofits or like all of these, you know, changes, you know, give people a sense of kind of pause.So I just need some clarity and to get on the record that the things that I'm going to be voting on include the things that we talked about and we fought for. And I just need some assurance around that.And where where does that fall in this?Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Here. There's a question on the floor from council here. Council block, would you like to respond to this?I guess the question I have for you and the clerk is that if if it were acceptable to take out of order, the first lady file matter and have it formally read into the record, I would be delighted to do that.The only reason that I wasn't able to do that is because of the.Order of our.Procedure in that meeting. So I don't know if you.Not only.Was. I went to the hospital. 420. We'll do it after.Sorry. Mr. President, can I also clarify? I received from the messenger city messenger the committee report of the late file. Or do other people not have that on their table? You don't have your. Yeah. The $17.7 million docket.It's in the triple packet of late files.I haven't. Say that.We'll take a brief recess.Thank you, Mr..That she recognizes. Counsel Bork. Counsel Bork, you have the floor and then I'll go back to counsel here.Thank you, Mr. President, just now that I think everybody has both items. I just want to clarify one more time, because we I know we discussed in the working session yesterday when we were talking about those two columns.Right. There's some so maybe it's procedurally helpful to know we're not allowed to amend the mayor's appropriation orders to be higher than the original number that was proposed. So the way that the 30 million is split is 12.3 of it is out of the 349.5 order that stock at 503 and 17.7 is out of this new latefiled supplemental order. So the various council priorities are split between those two things. So if you're looking for something, you may find it in the list that I just read into the record from 503, or you may find it stipulated in the 17.7 order.So I just wanted to specify that for councilors, just to be clear that that's where everything is. So thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, counsel. Look, the chair recognizes Councilor Baker was next. Counsel Baker, you have the floor.Thank you, Mr. President. Still some more than somewhat uncomfortable voting on this here today, after the day we've had still not totally square clear where a lot of things are going. I believe we could split this up into smaller buckets.Whatever, whatever has a priority, if it's a housing for our priority. We could be passed in 50 or 100 million today without a problem and be able to have this be a working sort of relationship here. With all that being said, I would like to offer an amendment to an amendment to trademark at 503 by reducing onwhat the only way that I could identify was on the Google document that came to me, which was line 20, massing cars, temporary low threshold shelter sites by 5 million, and adding 5 million in for the Georgia Tech field house.Just to be clear, that low threshold housing, that 16 million, we've already given them at least 5 million. Now for the low threshold housing, I think the number is is much higher than that. But what they've what they agree to is 5 million.And also the temporary low threshold housing is something that that community down there doesn't want. When we talk about we talk about decentralization and this this low threshold housing en masse. And Cass, make sure that that that issue that's going on down there is centralized down there for our entire lives.And in just for clarity, 5 million coming off the 206 million in housing brings that down to 201 million. A little bit of math. We just we just approved 70 million earlier in this mail, in this meeting, 70 million in grants from the feds for housing.So the 70 million plus the 201 million minus my 5 million, we're talking about $271 million here that that can potentially go through here today. So I'm going to and you all have the amendment in front of you pretty straightforward.5 million from the low threshold that housing down on en masse and gas and replace that with 5 million for the Dorchester Field House, which we all had a hearing on. I know the administration says they don't want to build infrastructure for nonprofits but will just pound money into them.That'll be that'll be gone. And we'll say we're talking about in ten years, it's all going to be a distant memory. The only thing we're going to be able to look at is going to be this. I was so I'm looking for a second on that as the president.Thank thank you. Counsel Baker. Um. Mr. Clarke, do you want to read it into the record first or should we? Yeah, we're going to read it into the record. Yeah. Mr. Clarke, please read that into the record of.Councilor Frank David.Until they come to an end.05033.NASCAR's temporary, so special, so to say, $5 million and $5 million for the Dorchester Fieldhouse.Is there a second? There is a second counsel firing second to Mr..President, based on the people that are in the room here, I mean, we're going to should we wait till people come back in the room for this photo? Because one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.Yeah. We'll wait for them to.Call somebody for.Us. We'll take we'll take a brief recess. Back in session. Please take your seat, everybody. Please take your seats, everybody. The the motion is properly before the body. And it has been second in at this time. Would anyone like to speak on this matter?Okay. The chair recognizes Councilor Borg Council book you of the floor.Thank you, President Flynn. If I could. Get city funding. Through the proper process to council Bakersfield house. I would I chaired the hearing that many folks attended. I thought it was compelling. I think despite the disagreement between people about the history of how the field house land was transferred or whatever, that there a really incredible vision there. And personally, as a private citizen, I hope to find opportunities to support it. I have received the clearest communication, including an informal letter which I read to the Council on Monday, that the mayor is not willing to support nonprofit infrastructure, including the field house.If this amendment goes on the three 49.5 docket, then that docket will be vetoed by the mayor. And also the mayor will not be signing the 17.7 supplemental. I if I sound tired, it's not actually because of the length of this meeting.It's because I've only slept between one and five in the morning the last two nights trying to get everybody stuff into these combined dockets. If people want to go back to the drawing board, and I understand that from Councilor Baker's perspective, it makes sense both because this item is not in it and because he doesn't think weshould be moving on this money all at once. Anyways, if folks agree, fine. But I think people need to be aware of what that amendment vote is. And I also think and I say this with with due respect and affection for my colleague here, that there is a difference between supporting the field House and backing an amendmentfor the field House that is effectively a poison pill to the effort to try to achieve council and mayoral collaboration on ARPA. So that's where I am as the chair and I'll be voting in opposition to the amendment.Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you. Thank you. Council chair recognizes Councilor Baker. Councilor Baker, you have the floor.I don't understand. Poison pill here. So if my 5 million gets in, it automatically gets gets vetoed from across the hall for no reason other than it's mine. So what am I supposed to do? People ask me to withdraw this here.You know, I've been disrespected through this thing here. In my opinion, a letter. A letter is. Is is read into the record, an informal record, because they say we can't build stuff.Without the money.You can't build stuff, put up the money. It's all going to be contracts. Not right. Not fair. I don't see us doing enough for our kids, for our teens, for people to get healthy after this after this pandemic.This is going to do that.There's three housing developments right around it. What are you waiting for? MAN Whoa! What are you waiting for? Veto it. I want to go put it over there and have her veto it. That's what I want.Veto the 350, because you're two stuck up. Thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me to have the floor.Thank you, Councilor Baker. Wanna take a brief recess? We're back in session.Right. So. I mean.Okay. We're back in session. The chair at this time. The chair recognizes. Councilor Baker. Councilor Baker, thank you. You have the floor.Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to withdraw the current motion and replace it. New language, please. And Alex has a new language called Castle.Baker is seeking to withdraw the previous amendment. Previous motion. He also provided a another motion that everyone should have now on their on their desk. Mr. Clarke, will you read that into the record, please?Motion of Councilor Frank Baker. Councilor Baker moves to amend Docket 0503 by reducing the Mayor's Office of Housing by $5 million and adding $5 million for the Dorchester Field House.The chair recognizes counsel Baker. Counsel Baker. You have the floor.Thank you, Mr. Chair. And if this if this passes with this amendment in here, we would have still, as a body passed, $271 million that will go towards housing. Just today. That's with my $5 million amendment. Thank you.Thank you, Councilor Baker. Any discussion on this matter for my colleagues.We need a second on new. I'm sorry. We need a second on the language.Second on no language. The second is by Councilor Murphy. The chair recognizes Councilor Murphy. I mean, I'm sorry. The Chair recognizes Councilman. Here. Councilman, here. You have the floor.Thank you, Mr. President. I just think it's important for those who are watching for us to get some clarity in terms of my kind of what does that play here? Because I keep hearing if we do this, then this will happen.And if we don't do this, this will happen. So I need to have it really clearly laid out about what is at play and what is the impact of what is at play. Just so that we can all be clear, because there's a lot of fear tactics, there's a lot of uncertainty.There's a lot of ways you can do this and you can't do that. I need it all laid out and I need the truth. On the floor.Thank you. Thank you. Councilman here. There's a question on the floor from councilman here on if we can explain the process a little. A little bit. Can I call on the chair council block? If you're able to give us a little bit of background information that might might be helpful to our colleagues.Sure. Well, I would just say I'm not a lawyer. And, you know, I think that the the question on the table, like in terms of what that's what's at stake. Council over here depends a little bit on how you read Section 17 of the charter, it appears.So if Section 17 of the charter applies, then it's possible for the mayor to to receive this and to disapprove in part of the appropriation and approve the rest of it. So that that would sort of that would allow the council to indicate support for Councilor Baker's idea and then send it across the fifth floor and seewhat happens. If you don't read 17 DE as applying to this and the reason that there's a question is because it's. It's a question of whether it discounts enough of that appropriation or if it's going to accept and expand because it's federal money.And I just don't I'm not legally able to answer that question. I think I think lawyers on both sides have been looking at that in the last 20 minutes. If it if 17 days doesn't apply, then we're in the situation that I described a minute ago, which is that there's no way except to do in like arejection at whole. So I think that's like there's just genuine uncertainty. But I think that our council and the council is taking the position that that we could make this amendment from Councilor Baker and then the mayor's office would be able to the mayor would be able to to make, you know, any selected vetoes.I will say. It's I don't think. I yeah. I'm pretty confident that we haven't had any selective like vetoing of appropriations in the time that I've been on the council. I don't know Councilor Flaherty, who would have a considerably longer record.So so I would just say that this is not been a general practice. And to be honest, it isn't it's not really something that I love the idea of just bringing into practice, because I think as a council we like the idea that when we vote for an appropriation, sort of we're voting for the whole package andthat the mayor that signs or doesn't sign the whole package. But I can't answer the question and I don't think anyone on the floor is going to be able to definitively answer the legal question of the interpretation of 17 D, but it's certainly possible the 17 D applies here and that therefore we could pass Councilor Baker's amendmentand then the mayor could make a decision on that and the rest of the appropriation could go through. But I can't give you certainty. I'm not equipped to. Thank you, Mr. President.Does anybody else have any questions or comments? The chair recognizes Counsel Baker at this time. Counsel Baker you have the floor.So what was said to me, councilman here sounded like a threat, was it? If my 5 million get in there, the mayor across the hall was going to veto the 350. That doesn't seem like leadership to me. You're going to because I get something in this 350 million.And to speak to this point over here, we're never going to have this opportunity ever again. So we're never going to have 350 million in front of us ever again. This is our only time right here. We're looking to pass it like as quick as we possibly can.There's no rush to pass this here today. We could have cut this up into 100 million and housing 50 million in this. And we're dumping money into into into nonprofits all over the place. So I was threatened with this mayor going to veto 350 million because I got 5 million in there.And now the discussion is, Oh yeah, well, she'll be able to just veto it anyway. Should I feel happy today? Should I feel like I've been uplifted today? Should I feel like I'm part of this body or part of this city today?No. And this fieldhouse isn't for me. I'm not going to go there. This fieldhouse is for the kids that you all met here. You all met them. You all fell in love with them.That's who was.On the board to make sure that they had what they wanted in the fieldhouse sway. It cost $55 million. That's why we should be building this sort of infrastructure all around the city. Build this one here, and then you'll see what we need to build for infrastructure.Let's stop giving away contracts. 350 million basically in contracts all out the door. We're not building any city infrastructure. We're not we're not doing anything with it. That's a strong statement. We're not doing anything. We're doing plenty with it.But we're not going to be able to, like we say, look, back in ten years and look at the good we did. Nobody's going to remember anything. They don't pay attention to legislation. Don't pay attention where money goes.They pay attention to good services. We're looking to give good services to door Chisholm. Three housing developments around it. All black and brown kids in an opportunity zone. What's your problem?Thank you. Councilor Baker, the chair. Recognize this council? Our council, where you have the floor.Thank you, President Flynn. I would just. I just rise to chair in both the chair and Councilor Baker's frustration about the process. I think that Councilor Baker did an incredible amount of work, held hearings where young people came and spoke to the council, gave similarly impassioned speeches about the impact that this feedback was going to have inhis neighborhood and effectively moved a lot of the council that wasn't supportive of getting the field house to be supportive of the field house because of the incredible amount of work that he did to get last minute word that the mayor wasn't going to be supporting.That is incredibly is incredibly frustrating. And so I share in that frustration in terms of the process. With that said, I do think that it's disingenuous to say that this is for the young people after we. Councilor Baker effectively just took a vote to help kill an amendment that was supposed to be for youth jobs.And so, although I admire his spirit and I share his frustration with the process, we have had plenty of opportunities here to make sure that we're giving investing in young people. And Councilor Baker has not taken them. And so I think that that stance is a little bit disingenuous.However, that is not the reason why I won't be supporting this amendment. I won't be supporting this amendment because as the Chair of Housing and Community Development, I cannot make a case for removing $5 million from housing or the ARPA funds.We're in the middle of a housing crisis. We need all of this money. Low threshold housing is a proven evidence based practice that's going to help people move through addiction and into permanent housing. And so I just want to I just want to say that I'm not going to be supporting this.Thank you. Thank you. Counsel to the chair recognizes counsel royal counsel of Royal U of the for you.President Flynn, I have a question which is mostly around the timing of. I know why we have a deadline for the city budget because at a certain point it goes into a 112. I have a question about whether or not there's an urgency to pass this today when we still don't have that, at least what I'm hearingconcrete sort of legal analysis as to what this will do or if this can get sort of put off until the next meeting, when we can have a further analysis on this from corporation counsel, from our own counsel and do that.I don't know if there's an urgency that I'm not aware of, which I'm happy to hear sort of the details, too, as to why this has to go through today when I think a lot of folks here are trying to figure out exactly what is happening from a legal standpoint.So I think that's for the chair that.Thank you, counsel. Very fair question, but I don't have the answer to that. COUNSEL Royal, if any of my colleagues have any information on that, that might be helpful to the body. The chair recognizes a block.Sure. Thank you, Mr. President. So on that, I mean, one of the reasons that. One of the reasons that we're moving this today is because of the fact that the. That Council. Sorry, guys, I really am very tired.We're doing this today in part because, as I mentioned, a huge amount of the housing. Money. Money is housing. And there is a. Mayor's Office of Housing Annual RFP that goes out in July. And it's the way that they start the process of making housing funds available.And one of the reasons why the timeline of that is important, as opposed to just like, oh, it's up to August, etc., is because of the way that for affordable housing projects like local funds line up with state funds and federal funds and there's like a whole kind of cycle process.And if you miss a level, then you often have to wait a year because of how the timing is done. And so again, because the money has to be spent by 2024, like all the contracts have to be signed by then, has to be totally spent by 2026, but you have to have obligated every dollar by 24. It's that that was one of the things that precipitated the ask. I know there are also some specific things because councilors have reached out to me about particular council priorities where the urgent need is now. I do just also want to say I like.I, I totally feel the impassioned, like sense for Councilor Baker about the field house. What I reject is the idea that the field house is the only real thing that we are talking about with the three, with the 349.5 and then the 17.7.I mean, we're talking about everything from the extension of the green jobs program that has just launched for us to, as I mentioned before, the creation of $45 million worth of home ownership units. The building of housing on public land actually adds a whole nother level from a time perspective to acquiring.I think you have to go through the whole process, right, of RFP and public process, etc. and then you try to spend the money to build housing. I just think like the child care, I mean, to me, child care is one of those things where there's of course something left at the end because every kid who getstouched by an investment in child care and every family where someone's able to hold a job because they're able to put their kid in affordable child care or off hours. Child care like council over here, champion is package like.That's all real. So I don't buy the idea that the field house is real and everything else is imaginary. And I just want to be really clear that the reason that we had to go to.The.Mayor's office and and ask them to reconsider making the harbor funds that are being held for next year's budget available to the council was because, frankly, there were so many real things in the original proposal that there wasn't sufficient appetite to get rid of them.And so what we've added are more real priorities, which again, I've just spent the last week hearing from all of you colleagues about the importance of and so I just it's I just want to say there are an enormous number of things that when we talk about a Green New Deal and we talk about, you know, transformingthe city of Boston for the better after COVID, like the things that people get excited about, they want to see them become real. And what it's going to take is the money to actually be appropriated and start getting spent.And, you know, so I feel very strongly as well about the reality of the things in the appropriation today. Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you. Thank you, counsel Buck. Councilman here. Did you have your chair?Because those on.The chair recognize this council. I'm here. And let me just say, before councilman here speaks, I can only have one person speaking at a time. And if you want to speak, raise your hand or hit the button and I will call on you.The chair recognizes. Councilman here. Councilman, here. You have the floor.Thank you. He realized my light was still on. But since you called on me, I'll use the time to just say something really quick. I think there's a lesson for us to learn in this entire process that I have come to see a reoccurring pattern.And for me, oftentimes I move on principle and process. And I think these two things. What I continue to see is we have a lot to grow from and learn from. As it relates to not just this conversation just overall.So I'm just going to consider this as fits and starts. Like we're all figuring things out and assuming the best intentions, right? Because it is what it is. But to what is the most frustrating for me and I'll just speak for myself is the the last minute switch ups and information that comes trickle down.And it seems like. It just makes it really hard for us to make informed decisions when we don't have all of the facts in front of us. And I hope that we can all learn from from this journey.And I still say that while I do appreciate the explanation, it doesn't. I'm still stuck on how we got here to begin with. But I you don't have to go belabor the point. I just want to say for the record that I it still feels to me that this whole entire journey since we've entered this budgeting process, whether it be through the operating or whether it be through this, it just feels like the administration and the council. We've done our due diligence to find common ground. And it feels like sometimes when we get there the.Things switch up at the last minute, and that's frustrating and that's hard to build trust when you never know what you're walking into. So I just think as we continue to move forward in our journey here that, you know, either I ask better questions so I can be better informed, so I'll take ownership for that.But then I think that there's some work that everybody needs to do, including the administration, so that we can be set up for success in the next go round. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman. Somebody here, the chair recognizes counsel. Clarity. Counsel, clarity. You have the floor.Thank you, Mr. President. And obviously, through the through the chair to the original question, there's no time since sensitivity on it with respect to other than the the fees that go out. And we do have up until I think the 24th but through the chair, I just want to state has done tremendous work on it.I've served in that capacity the last two years and just to try to herd and pull things together and deal with the different priorities and personalities and also dealing with the administration. It's it's tough stuff. So she's done tremendous work, I believe, obviously, in in the field house and the generations of of young people and families thatthat will serve. And I do believe that that that that should be, I guess, serviced and funded and supported by ARPA funds. I think that's exactly what they're for and getting to a position of having things be shovel ready and to get those services, those support and wraparound services around kids and families is, is really what makesthis job an exciting thing to do when you can transform lives, children, families, neighborhoods and so this field how speaks to that and I think that that was sort of the spirit the intense behind ARPA that said through the chair to the original question is I guess was the question is it possible to table this I guessis the question. And I think that that is true. And but I would also, as a courtesy through the chair to the to and through the President to the chair, given the time and effort that has gone into her work here.Just want to make sure that we sort of we're not disrespecting her in that process. But it is a fair ask. We meet again back here on July the 13th. There seems to be some concerns about this issue and some tension and uneasiness about whether they're supporting or not supporting and what does it mean and what doesit mean? And then the lawyers, I don't want to see Adam stop doing the shifty swerving again. And clearly, I want Christine, our attorney, in the room, frankly, just so that we're getting a sort of a full focus on it.But if this is a situation where we need to maybe get the legal interpretation, that's a good purpose potentially for a table. Or if there's a push and pull of this, where as a legislative branch of city government, we do believe that the field house should be included in ARPA funding and we need some additional time toconvince folks that that's appropriate. Or if folks just because we've been here now since noon and folks just want to kind of, you know, vote your conscience for all that. But I think the initial question was, is it time sensitive?The question is no, but there are some RFP dates that through the through the presence of the chair need to be need to be adhered to. But also the other question I thought I heard was, can we table this?Which was not sort of answered, but I don't want to speak for you, Mr. President, or the chair or the maker of the amendment. It's kind of not my space. We've got a measure of an amendment that's been seconded.You as the president, obviously as the chief parliamentarian here. And then we also have the chair of the committee, and then we actually have a legitimate ask from one of our colleagues. And so within that sort of happy to just offer advice on it, but I want to defer it to the folks that have spent the timeand have put the effort into this process yet.Thank you, Counsel. Clarity. And it's a it's a fair question. It's a fair question that Counsel Arroyo also brought up as well is what what is the time frame of this? There was a question from you, counsel, clarity as to what would counsel a bake a table this until we get more advice, we get a better opinion, we get more information from our central staff, also from legal counsel, probably at the at the mayor's office. That was the question I believe you asked, counsel, clarity and counsel Arroyo asked. I'm going to call on counsel Counsel Baker But before I do that, I would like to call on counsel BORK if you want to address that, because I think you might have some information that might be helpful to the body.So that is.Thank you, Mr. President. What I would say is, in terms of order of operations, I think that Counselor Baker has an active and seconded amendment on the docket that I've been speaking to. I think we need to take a vote on that docket.I think that is depending on whether the amendment fails or passes. I could address the question of tabling, but I can't I don't feel like I can address the question of tabling a docket where. The. Where where it's not clear yet what docket we're talking about.It's either the one that was originally proposed or the one modified as by Councilor Baker.Okay. Thank you, Counsel. BLOCK I know I'm going to call on counsel. Baker Then I'm going to call on counsel. Arroyo After counsel. Baker You were next.I have no right to withdraw this. To withdraw this. I want to see a vote on this.Thank you. Counsel and Counsel Arroyo.That sort of answers the question. I was going to say if it was withdrawn to the table, but it sounds like that's been answered.So thank you, counsel. No further comments. No further questions. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The chair recognizes counsel to counsel. You have the floor.I withdraw my question. It was answered.Okay. The chair recognizes Counsel Fernandez Anderson. Counsel Fernandez. Innocent. You have the floor.Thank you, Mr. President. Madam Chair, are you able to answer about tabling this at all?I'm sorry.I just. Yeah, I just want to.Give counsel back.Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. So if Councilor Baker's amendment were to fail, then the docket would not face this legal question. So obviously, I would not be looking to table it if Counselor Baker's amendment were to succeed.Then the legal question would be on the table and then, like, you know, like consider tabling it. You might want to have further conversation the body. But but yes, that's why that's why I said it matters, because if the amendment fails, then there wouldn't be a legal reason to table it for two weeks.Thank you, counsel. It's it's my understanding in talking to the clerk that the only way it could be tabled is if Counsel Baker agreed to table it.His amendment. Yes.Yes.I saw that. No.You have the full council back?Yeah, I can see this.This doesn't get any.Better if this goes longer. This is my time right here. I want to see a vote on this. I've asked, you know, we should have had some sort of expression of of support on this. I had the hearing we had the hearing back in April.Four people have known this for four months. So this if this goes two weeks or whatever, it doesn't get any better from me. 5 million doesn't get in there. 2 million doesn't get in there. Nothing gets in there for me.So this is my time right here.Thank you. Counsel Baker. Counsel Carter is next. Counsel Cleta. And then I'm going to cut it off and we're going to we're going to take a vote. Counsel Clarity of the floor.Thank you. Council President Flynn Those that know me know that I love to prep and I love legal analysis. And so I would like to see a written response and interpretation from the mayor on Section 17. It sounds like Councilor Baker does not want that to happen.So with the information that is in front of me and the urgency of. The things that I have fought for. I love you, friends. I'm going to vote no.Thank you. Thank you, Counsel Carter. Um, we're going to take. We're going to take a vote. I think we've done enough discussing of the matter. We're going to take a vote. Mr. Clerk. We're taking a vote on council.A baker's amendment, although all those in favor say aye. Aye, aye. Opposed. Well, Mr. Clarke, would you take a roll call vote, please?Roll call vote on amendment offered by Councilor Frank Baker. Councilor Arroyo. Yes. Councilor Arroyo. Yes. Councilor Baker. Councilor Baker. Councilor Buck. Councilor Buck. Now. Councilor Braden. Councilor Braden. No. Councilor Coletta. No. Council Leader No. Councilor Fernandes. Sanderson. Yes.Councilor Fernandes Hanson. Yes. Council 30. Council for clarity. Yes. Council Flynn. Yes. Councilor Flynn. Yes. Councilor. No Council and no council. Illusion Council. The Regional Council and me here. Yeah. Council on me here. Yes. Councilor Murphy? Yes. Councilor Murphy.Yes. Council world?Yes.Council World. Yes. The amendment of council.

I want to stress that we talked in this council before about the possibility of adopting the government code that is utilized for school districts that require some training, among other things, proposed bargaining items being offered and ask, as well as tentative agreements before ratification by the legislative body. Until recently. Well, what happened when we had this discussion at council originally, and how did it the Civil Service and Personnel Committee was that cities had not adopted anything similar and the city attorney's staff brought to usa committee that recently the city of Costa mesa had enacted the Civic Openness and Negotiations Ordinance, actually with the support and help of the City Employees Association and among other things. What this requires is the city must hire an independent negotiator before contract talks with an employee association.Begin an independent economic analysis must be done on the fiscal impacts of each contract term, and the results of that analysis must be made public 30 days prior to negotiations. Often this council doesn't even get that each council member must disclose if he or she has had any communications about the negotiations with the representative of the employeeassociation. As negotiations begin, the City Council must report publicly after closed sessions, any prior offers and counteroffers and their fiscal impact to the taxpayer. And they meet and confer related bargaining positions received and or made by either side that are no longer being considered must also be disclosed and before the City Council can vote on an employeecontract. It must be discussed at least two council meetings and the proposal posted on the city website at least seven days prior to the first meeting. The Civil Service and Personnel Committee brings us to the full council with a request that the city attorney take a look at this ordinance and advise the city council whether or notthat is something that the City Council could adopt. Please don't shoot the messenger. This this is something that we want it to finish up in civil service and personnel committee. I know it is controversial, particularly among labor unions.I will give you my credits out here first that I've been a longtime labor attorney and I understand both sides in terms of their position. But I also do understand that we need more transparency and openness in this process.And I want to thank Mr. DeLong for co-sponsoring this. And with that, I would make a motion that we request the city attorney to provide a review of the city of Costa mesa, civic openness and negotiations ordinance and the feasibility of a similar ordinance being adopted by the Long Beach City Council.Second.There's been a motion, and a second, any public comment on the item? I'd like to make a substitute move to receive and file. There's been a motion in a second to receive and file any public comment on the item.See none. No other council comment. Councilor DeLong.So I'm sorry, Jerry, could you elaborate on exactly what was your motion here?My motion was to request that the city attorney would because we don't have this in the agenda item that he review the ordinance that has been in use in the city of Costa mesa and report back to the city of Long Beach as to whether or not such a ordinance is feasible.We have the report in committee, but we didn't get a follow up. Thank you. It my intention here.Thank you. Okay. Well, I guess what I'd like to do as a substitute substitute now I what I'd like to add to that that now I request the city attorney to look at it from a legal perspective, but to ask the city manager to respond to the council as well as to how and what the identified potentialpros and cons are from a city staff and human resources perspective in moving this direction. You know, while I would certainly like to see what they both have to say, I would tell you for me, anything that improves the transparency of what we do, I think is a good thing.I know that some of the most difficult questions that I get from the community is after we have voted and, you know, a very large contract such as this is, you know, how did we get to where we got to?What can I say? What can I not say? You know, a great deal of it occurred in closed session. So I really can't provide that much information from a legal perspective, the community and I think this would go a long way towards not only providing the community additional information, but also making it clear to what we cantalk about, what we can't talk about, because it will be a published document or at least the appropriate portions of it will be published. So that's my motion.But there's been a motion and a second concern. Boston.Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Sikorski and a longer list for bringing forward this this issue for discussion. I have no issue with transparency either. I think as public officials, we should all be laying it out there for our public to see.And as far as I'm concerned, our labor negotiations, the contracts are online and available for any resident to see at any time. The contract negotiations obviously is done between city staff and labor negotiators representing various unions. I don't think any of us are in those rooms or in those proceedings are or or privileged any of the theinformation in those proceedings other than giving direction to the staff. As far as the transparency component, I've worked through the Mayor's Millions Brown Back Act that actually governs collective bargaining, the state law that governs collective bargaining for local government and for the city of Long Beach.There's nothing in here that that that that refers to that. I've actually read the deals act where there is some sort of a little bit more transparency with state employees as far as disclosing the terms of the contracts upfront.And so in that regard, I think you may be on the right track, but what I'm also concerned about is the additional and unnecessary cost that could be associated with some of the the proposals here specifically related to hiring outside counsel to negotiate contracts.I mean, if we don't have qualified employees here to do that in H.R., we need to get them because that is a perpetual interest that the city has. I mean, contract negotiations don't end at the end of contract negotiations.Meeting confirms happen throughout the year. And I think what's missing here is probably from the public as well is that negotiations are ongoing. You know, they never stop. On wages, conditions, benefits, particularly in terms and conditions of employment.When policy changes are made, their meaning confers. And that's that bargaining. That's collective bargaining. So I'm really concerned about the additional cost that that could be associated with this. I will agree that during this last round of negotiations, there were some areas where I had some concerns about, concerns about I'm not sure they're fully addressed here.And because of that, I think I'm in support of Councilmember O'Donnell's motion to receive and file.Okay. We're going to move on. Before we go on, conservatorships, we can get a clarification. I thought I'd heard a second on counterpart to Long's motion. Was there a second? No second concern for Lowenthal, Second City Councilmember Shipka.Mr. Ashton, I appreciate your comments. Although you did talk to me about perhaps having an outside negotiator for the management portion of the contract.So you're right, I did.I think that is that's prudent. And it eliminates any sort of conflict if that is the case. But this doesn't say that.Well, if I can, I will I will add that I know the Miller is Myers Brown at backwards and forwards, having represented numerous city employee groups. And I will tell you, nothing in that act prohibits us from doing this whatsoever.This in no way impacts the rights of the two parties to negotiate. It is not bringing the public in to the bargaining room. It is simply getting information out to the public in a timely manner. And perhaps maybe with the substitute that I think Mr. DeLong did, the city attorney can come back.And that's what my request was. And in fact, if there would be any difficulties in terms of the contracts online, there is no cost associated on those contracts. There is no financial analysis published either for the council or the public about each contract term and the cost.That is much different than just posting a contract online so that this goes beyond that. And then I would be very interested from the city manager's point of view what the added cost would be for us to be transparent.I think, you know, the fiscal impact, as I put in the motion, is to be determined by the city manager and we don't know. So perhaps a separate from hiring a independent negotiator for the management team, I would be very interested to see what the costs would be involved for the other issues here, too.And I think maybe in Mr. Lang's motion that could be covered when we get the report back.Mr. O'Dowd. I can't remember long ago.I just wanted to confirm that we're looking for information on this issue. I don't think we're changing anything. I'm not averse to receiving a report from the city attorney or staff on on any aspect of this. And then we can take up any recommendation that any council member may bring forward.But there's no recommendation here, and it's asking for a report. And that's where my support is coming from.Mr. Dillon.Thank you. You know, Councilmember, often I share your concern about adding any cost to the government process. But like Councilmember Lowenthal, I guess what I thought we were doing was asking for some additional information here. I'm certainly not wedded to it has to be done this way.But, you know, maybe a maybe a third. It's this good, maybe a half, maybe 80%. I don't know. I think I'll have a a better feel for that up to the city attorney and the city manager come back with some kind of report for us to to review and discuss.But certainly, I would share your concern that, you know, does it really make sense to hire an outside firm to do all this? Perhaps not. Maybe it does for management, but it doesn't for the other labor groups. And I would certainly be, you know, very open and interested in that kind of a discussion.But at least I to have the information come back so we could have that kind of discussion. So that's why I support the the motion that's on the table.Let's get along just for you. Just repeat what the motion is.Basically, yes, the motion is to request the city attorney to provide a review of the city of Costa mesa Civic over openness, negotiations, ordinance and the feasibility of a similar ordinance being adopted by the lobby, city council. And for the city manager to provide, you know, perhaps a memo that determines the feasibility from a staff and humanresources perspective, what the pros and cons might be of this approach.So you're not adopting it.You're just just asking for information.All right, Mr. Ralston.And thanks. Thanks a lot. I do appreciate, like I said, that discussion. My my my real concern here is that we the collective bargaining process is difficult and complicated enough, as is with the dynamics that exist by further complicating this and politicizing it.I think it will it will dilute and pollute the process even further. And so I think and I don't mean any disrespect to to to the authors of this agenda item. I just think we need to move forward very carefully using Costa mesa as an example.Costa mesa has not been the the the example city that we want to follow in terms of our labor management relationship. And so I would I will just rest on that.Mr. Mayor, can a comment.Yeah, go ahead.Well, you know, I had the same response when I saw the draft of the of the item. And Councilwoman Chavkin explained it to me when I brought that to her attention when she said that the ordinance was actually developed cooperatively between management and labor.But I guess.I beg your pardon.Were.Well, but I guess it wasn't shoved down anybody's throat. So it was it was done in a harmonious way. And if we move forward with some aspect of this, I would hope it would be done in a harmonious, harmonious way in Long Beach as well.And also, so have.We consulted with any of our employee groups about this?Well, I know that that's the motion is in fact, I won't get that kind of information, Mr. Austin. But nobody nobody is agreeing to go any way in the direction of goes to Mesa or not in the direction of Costa mesa.And I think what everybody's trying to do, or at least with the motions trying to do, is to see what the pros and cons of that approach are. And quite frankly, you know, I mean, people say if it's not broke, don't fix it.But that doesn't mean if it's not broke, don't improve it. And you at least should have some information out there as to what some alternatives are. I know there's a lot of nervousness. I don't know which election period and all that stuff.But you know what? Just getting information doesn't appear to me to be harmful. I'll just state that. Mr. Garcia.Thank you. I'm going to first, I think listen, open and transparency, I think is great. I'll be brief. I am familiar with the Costa mesa model. I personally have information about I don't think it's a model we want to replicate here in Long Beach.So I'll be voting no on the motion.Okay. All right. Any further comments? If not, we have a motion as described by Mr. DeLong, the city attorney, city manager, to come forward with information about my words, pluses and minuses of the the outlines of the Costa mesa at all procedure on collective bargaining members.Castro.Well, Mr.. Mr. Mayor, if I may. Yeah. If if Vice Mayor Garcia has a concern, they want to look at one model that that he doesn't think was the most optimal. I mean, I'm not going to do this.I'm certainly open looking. If there's any specific cities that you're aware of, do you think goes well? Or if you want us to give staff a more general direction to take a look at other cities in addition to Costa mesa?I'm certainly receptive to that. Would that be helpful?All right, let let. Let's go forward. Okay. All right. On. On Mr. Dillon's motion. Members casting votes.Motion fails for four votes. Four votes? No.Okay. So we would go revert to Mr. Donnelly's motion, is that correct? Right. Which is to receive and file that. Correct. All right. Members on Mr. O'Donnell's motion to receive and file reset the board. I'm Mr. Downs motion.Motion carries five votes. Three votes.All right. Thank you and good discussion. Thanks very much. That was item 11, was it not? Correct.

Okay. And this is city attorneys. Yes.Good evening, Mayor and Council. I'm going to do a very fast staff report at this hour.We appreciate.That. This ordinance proposed in front of you tonight seeks to clarify housing laws for the city of Alameda. There has been there are a lot of federal and state laws that apply here, and there are also a lot of civil laws that may apply here.But this law attempts to put city of Alameda housing laws in clear terms. It essentially creates three components, and much of that is not subject to serious debate with respect to whether or not it has applicability in in a rental community.The first of the first of which is disruption of housing services. There is substantial civil law out there and also state and federal law that requires non disruption of housing services, such as disconnection of utilities or lockouts unless it's authorized by a court of law.This ordinance here makes that explicit in the city of Alameda with respect to tenant harassment. This law spells out certain behaviors that are clearly outside the pail and make them prohibited. The third component with augments state and federal laws with respect to discrimination.It specifically indicates that whether it's disability, age, housing status and perhaps most importantly, source of income, these categories cannot be bases of discrimination in the city of Alameda. I want to point out that source of income is the one area where probably the most substantive change is being proposed tonight.That particular change, its source of income protect this source of income protection will protect, for example, persons receiving subsidies such as Section eight. That protection does not currently exist in any other source of law. And so the Council will be making a significant substantive change here.And there has been two cases litigated, at least in the state of California, one by the city and county of San Francisco, one by the city of Santa monica. In both cases, California courts have affirmed local jurisdictions right to prohibit this type of discrimination and the ordinances before the Council for your consideration.I'm happy to take your questions.Any questions of staff? Councilmember Desai So.Currently isn't it correct to say that when a landlord accepts a Section eight tenant that they are also entering into a contract with the housing authority that, among other things, stipulates that the landlord is going to provide a unit that's going to meet certain standards established by HUD and managed or monitored by the local housing authority.Yes. Yeah. So so here's the question then. So that the changes that were contemplating then. Are we not then saying that? That landlords have to accept Section eight. I mean, because if they have to accept Section eight and it's no longer a voluntary thing.Then aren't we saying that landlords have to adopt or accept the the standards that are stipulated in HUD?Not necessarily Councilmember de Song. What landlords have to do is to essentially not discriminate on the basis of source of income. So, for example, a landlord could say, I want a tenant with a particular credit score or I want a tenant with a particular income to debt ratio, or I want a tenant with a particular background, forexample. No, no unlawful detainers. All of these are legitimate bases. What a landlord could not do under this ordinance to say to say, my rent is $2,000 a month. I will take 2000 from any other source. But I if the two part of that 2000 comes from federal government subsidies, that's no good to me.That is the one behavior that this this particular source of income discrimination prohibition will seek to stop.Mm hmm. But couldn't. A tenant. Advocate, legal advocate. Take up a case of a Section eight household who thought that she or he was discriminated against because they were Section eight, even if there was no language that says, you know.You will not discriminate against Section eight. It's just the point at which the prospective tenant had indicated that her or his source of income was Section eight. And so by not. Getting the unit could detect. Could that then set up a situation where that tenant was saying, well, I'm going to make a discrimination case?It is hypothetically possible, though, under existing law, for example, let's say it's a male tenant and the landlord sees the male tenant and then chooses to rent to a female tenant under existing law. This tenant could choose to sue for gender discrimination, even though the landlord may have chosen the female tenant because she's got a much bettercredit score. So it is hypothetically possible, though, it would fall into the same paradigm that is today with respect to other categories of discrimination.Any other clarifying questions? Okay, let's go to public speakers.Okay. Alan T Cherry Johansen, Madeline Howard and Laura. Regina.Eleanor Schweizer.I'm actually going to talk really fast because I have several really questions. So my reading of the court cases regarding Section eight in terms of discrimination is that you are indeed required to enter into the agreement. You have to sign it.And according to the legislation analysis for the Section eight, the LED the bill that's going through the Senate and may have been defeated. They also said, yes, you will have to sign the agreement. You can't say I would accept the money, but I must sign the agreement.So probably want to double check that the burden of proof for a landlord who is abused by a tenant is a much higher bar because that involves termination of tenancy and that involves the whole unlawful detainer. So both parties should be really held to the same civilized behavior without having to resort to threatening to terminate tenancy andgoing through all of that. So every place in this where it talks about the landlord as the offending party really should be either person. Everybody should be civilized. I asked the question I did not get an answer in regards to if a landlord or some other authorized person while lawfully entering a rental unit sees damage in thearea that they're in. They see the door has a giant hole punched in it. They see the toilet cracked. Can they document that? Can they act on that knowledge because it says harassment, says you cannot collect evidence and I just need clarification that that is indeed.Yes, you can document it and it's totally a cool. That would be great. So otherwise everything else in this. Totally support.Thank you.Speaker Sherry to him. Of.Good evening, everybody awake? I am speaking right now as Sherry Johansen for Alameda. Progressives and the Alimony Progressives have worked with our allies and this council to extend renter protection to most of the residents of Alameda, including tonight's ordinances.We agree with with Councilman Odie that housing is a human right. We would like to keep our neighbors and our friends and our families, our children in Alameda and help prevent this epidemic of homelessness that we have in the Bay Area.I am hoping that this ordinance and I'm not a lawyer and neither is anybody on the Alameda Progressives Board will extend the protections that we have fought so hard for to as an umbrella for residents who do not have the income, who are disabled, who may be in Section eight or may be covered under the housing authority, because these evictions and harassment we had harassment of for 70. So I'm glad that that's taken care of as extended to to the entire rental community in Alameda. So we are in favor of this ordinance. Thank you.And Madeline Howard, then Lorna.Hello again. I'm Madeline Howard with Western Center on Law and Poverty. I also live in Alameda. Thank you to the city attorney and to the council for this ordinance. I strongly support it. This is incredibly important for to protect our most vulnerable residents.And I also wanted to point out that as I'm sure the city attorney is aware, there are increased obligations under a new state law that we sponsored AB 686 that requires the city to take affirmative steps to end segregation and to promote integration.And this ordinance would be an important step towards that goal because people with housing choice vouchers are disproportionately people within protected classes, people of color, people with disabilities, as you've already heard. So allowing these members of the community to have increased protections would be an important step towards that goal.Thank you.Mr. Sheen.Good evening again and thank you very much to the mayor and the city council for voting today on an emergency ordinance. And my father and I are very grateful, as well as many people in Alameda who rely on Section eight.I'm sure they do appreciate it as well. Thank you for closing the loophole and doing the right thing. And a second, thank you to the city council for this ordinance. You did a tremendous work here, and it's very important that this ordinance is enacted, because today I think that the Alameda Housing Authority addressed that issue, that peoplein Section eight might be discriminated against. Well, the way to close this and to, um, to protect them from discrimination would be to enact this very ordinance. And I can tell you that during the last two years ordeal, I scoured the Craigslist numerous times.And what I find deeply offensive is when I look at it and it says, no dogs, no Section eight. Full stop. This should not be allowed. And I think this is very well the ordinance is very well worded.I think it will allow protection to the most vulnerable people and I encourage the city to vote for it. Thank you very much.Thank you. Uh, is there a speaker? Correct. Okay. Um, council. Council member. Only did I see your handout. Sure.I'll go first. Um, as a result, we did include immigration status in here.We believe that's fully protected because.It has a David choose. Okay. Also is thank you for bringing this forward. I mean, I trust our city attorney a judgment over anyone else's in this matter given, you know, he's litigated in this matter and worked in a city that has sworn to protect tenants.And you probably even may have worked on that case. I don't know. So I'm fully prepared to support this. And it's about time.Set in motion.Well.Sure.Second.Is there any further discussion?Can I just ask a quick question? There was a the speaker asked a question. You were nodding your head, but he wasn't looking at you. He was looking at us. Can you just answer that? Yes. With respect.Yes.With respect to the question of whether a landlord could legitimately go into a unit to document actual legitimate damage, the answer is yes. Thank you.All right. So we've had a motion. Did we have a second wave of discussion? And Councilmember.So just some quick points. I believe the city of San Jose had passed a similar ordinance last month and I think there are certain provisions in it where. A certain there is language about a fix up period. So if someone found a Section eight landlord to be not compliant with whatever.Rather than go immediately to litigation or encourage that that that some kind of fix it period was adopted. The other thing, too, was that there was a delay in implementation for 60 days. So that so that the so that stakeholders, both sides, all sides could understand what was the ramification, clear ramifications of this.So I'm wondering if that was something that anyone would be interested in.I will just. Say that? Well, first of all, this would need a second reading, correct? Yes. So it does. There's 30 days and it comes back and there's certainly time for some landlord education. I would hope that the prohibitions in this ordinance are the sort of thing that a landlord wouldn't need to be told are wrong.I do know what Miss Ritchie was referring to about Craigslist ads, but that's one of the places where we're doing enforcement. We might you know, we might look. But I would think that the the time it takes to enact the ordinance for it to go into effect would would address the need for landlords to be educated.My thought. Okay. Any further discussion?Well, I'm just going to assume if we approve it tonight, there's 60 days before it goes into effect. So it does. Right. All right. Any any action we have has that.30 days before the second reading and then 30 days before it goes into.Effect.From my position.That.It's 45 days. So the second reading will be two weeks from now and then it'll be another 30.Days before that. Okay.I'm not inclined to add another 15 to that.I was just going to say I am a big fan of conversation and education, but I think where we're actually trying to stop discrimination, the idea of holding off and stopping discrimination for a few more days so that we can help people understand that they shouldn't discriminate.If that's if that's really needed, then we should figure out how to get this happening. So.So you agree with me? Okay.My my concern isn't only that this is a discussion about discrimination, but this is also a discussion about HUD standards that some smaller mom and pop landlords might feel that they have to they might not be inclined to get in volved in the program because for whatever reason, they might feel that previously they might have felt thatit was bureaucratic. But by virtue of adopting this now, they might feel like they have to, but not quite recognizing that if they adopt this program, then they're not only that, one of the implications of that is also having to then adopt.Certain standards that we might have that that HUD or the local housing authority might have. For example, I think one of the standards that our housing authority has is that, you know, as part of Section eight, you know, every unit has to have a 60 B 65 degrees between the month of October and May.Not only does every unit have to be at a minimum, 65 degrees between October and May, that. If if the heating unit or air conditioning unit breaks down. A temporary replacement. One of those things that you bring in is not allowed.So it's these kinds of details that I think people need to be aware of when they're entering into the Section eight. And I think it takes time for people to understand that. But I don't know. I mean, I.So I, I'm I think you raise good points. I also am, as was noted earlier in the previous housing item, there will be workshops in September and October and we can certainly ask staff now that we know. And Mr. Katz from the Housing Authority is nodding in agreement in the audience now, and the workshops really are excellentand informative, and they also videotape the one at the library. So even if you can't be there in person. But I think those are valid concerns to raise. But I think there are ways that that can be addressed in educational forums.So I know Mr. Odie and Councilmember Odie made a motion to approve this. Did I have a second? I do. Okay. Councilmember Vela seconds. So all in favor of this ordinance amending the municipal code i. I opposed. Abstain.Okay. So that motion passes for in favor of one abstention. Okay. We got to move along, people, because we're only going till midnight. So we've got one more regular calendar item, which is six F and that's also your.Is also me. All right.This to make this one fast as well mayor and council the proposal in front of you tonight requests that the city attorney's office is staffed with a prosecution unit consisting of one city prosecutor slash attorney and one paralegal investigator.The proposal will allow this unit to work with the district attorney's office, our partners at the police department, fire department, code enforcement, in order to enforce the various laws that this council has adopted, and as well as having the opportunity to enforce state laws.And one of the most important things I want to point out and maybe a few important things that one in in order for us to do prosecution, we do it in the name of justice. So there is not a particular group or a particular agenda that this group will be undertaking.\nSummary:", "answer": "Introduction of Ordinance Amending the Alameda Municipal Code by Adding Article XVIII to Chapter VI Concerning Fair Housing and Tenant Protections by Prohibiting Unlawful Tenant Harassment, Disruption of Housing Services and Housing Discrimination including Source of Income.

It has been stated that the soccer field was to be artificial turf, but when the developer spoke in his rebuttal, he said he could go either way on this.And so I'm hoping that. As this park is developed. You will consider putting in a a natural grass field. If you put in an artificial field. It will have to be fenced to keep off. Drinks, food, bikes. Cars.All the things that destroy an artificial field. So that means that this will not be open for the children of the neighborhood to play on. There will have to be a locked gate to keep out. Any. This is what has happened in Hawaii and Gardens.If you go over to the field, they're behind the. Casino. You will find that they have a paid worker there to keep out anybody that's not on a team and all the team members are searched before they go on to the artificial sports field to make sure they have only water.The artificial turf is more fragile than a natural grass field. And there are other considerations, such as heat and injury risk, that makes natural grass much more. Usable for a large population of children, not just soccer players. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker.My comments are going to be pretty much the same as my previous comment, so I'll keep it brief. The soccer field is another does the same thing. This is going to be a recurring theme with me. Again, I'm wondering why the city is specifying artificial turf.I'm having a lot of trouble with this one is that we have, again, a document that is contradicting itself. There's. At least within the city. We have two people. We have we have a councilperson that stating that is incorrect and we're using the same document, it seems to drive the the need for artificial turf.And the specifications is obviously going through the city and it is being requested from our planning department, whoever is he's getting his information from. If I'm incorrect on that, please let me know. I've also looked at the, uh, the documents that Mr. Parkin has said that drives the.The city has said that they are. The council has said that the the meeting minutes of September 3rd, 2013, was. The Council has decided that. They were that that it was artificial turf was done. I've looked at the video.I've also given it to federal prosecutors who live in California and a judge, a federal judge. And they've looked over the documents. And I'll be I'm just going to quote from what they said is that you have to be crazy to to even think that this is has any kind of intention whatsoever to.To go artificial. And I'm just telling you, this is what they're telling me. I've got 30 years of contract experience and I don't see any place at all where where they said that there was artificial was being driven from there.So I'm just trying to understand. Can you tell me where how I mean, any reason, even the slightest reason, even a phrase that says, look, we're trying to improve artificial surfaces for all of the cities on here. I don't see a single document, a single writing.I don't see a single even thing on the video that shows that. Are we see is a budget that's been approved for the different fields on this particular one. I don't know what's driving it, but I just got to understand, we have a mayor here, great, intelligent, good looking mayor.And he's saying that he wants to to, you know, going green is the way to go. It helps the environment. And now we're we're paving over it with artificial turf. That's what I'm saying.

But but we are going to close in in memory. We do have a closing council district extension facility. We're going to move on to item number 13 and let's do a voice motion.I'm pretty sure the council councilmember supervisor was read. It was read the item on 13.Communication from councilman super not Councilwoman Allen Councilman Price recommendation to request.City Council support.For the CARE Court Framework and request City Manager to examine a local program administered by the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services.All right. Council members who bring our motion there. A second here.I'll second its price in a pricing.Okay. Price. Okay. Let's go ahead, Councilman Supriya.Okay. Thank you. I will just read one sentence from the agenda using memo that's also included in the press release from Governor Newsom. The care court framework was created using the evidence that many people can stabilize, beginning healing and exit homelessness in less restrictive community based care settings.The plan focuses on people with schizophrenia, spectrum and other psychotic disorders who may also have substance use challenges and who lack the medical decision making capacity and advances and upstream diversion from more restrictive conservatorships or incarceration. And my comments will be brief tonight before I handed over to the second of the motion.But that's not because I'm not enthusiastic about this. I can tell you that the governor made his press release on March 3rd, and this item was agenda for this meeting tonight, four days later on March 7th. I firmly believe in this because it represents a paradigm shift in the way we're dealing with this crisis.And that's exactly what our constituents have been asking for. I noted in a press Telegram editorial that it was reference that, yeah, this this problem started when our governor, Ronald Reagan, closed all the mental institutions. I'm sure we've all heard that line before, but that if you want to say that he signed a bill rather than vetoit, the linchpin bill, that was in 1967. So 55 years ago, what has always struck me about that analysis is that we've had seven governors since Ronald Reagan was governor of California and both ends of the spectrum, very conservative to very progressive.And I don't think Ronald Reagan was that powerful a judge and we just lacked the will to address this. And finally, Governor Newsom has to tackle this issue head on. And I'd like our counsel to stand in support of that tonight.I also want to say that I'm fully aware that this has to be passed by the legislature and all bills are tweaked along the way. But in principle, I'd like us to support it tonight. Also, I added to this that I would like to see local control here.The item as presented is not set up that way. It's for counties. But we do have our own health department and I've already talked to the director of Health and Human Services who mentioned to me, well, this is kind of this is a civil court based system, and we don't have that ability.But you know what? It's very early on in the process. So all I'm asking is for city staff to work on a system that we might be able to have local control over. So with that, I'd like to hand it off to the Secretary of the Motion.Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Supernova. And thank you for inviting me to sign on to this item. This is an item that's obviously a very important item in terms of a lot of the things that are happening in the area of criminal justice reform and early interception and connecting people with services rather than causing unforeseenor unanticipated negative interactions with law enforcement and the justice system. In recent years, we've definitely seen the landscape change and although many of our state laws have been that have been implemented were done with good intentions, there have been negative consequences of some of those.So I'm thankful that the Governor is proposing this new initiative that will help better address the needs of those most urgently in need, those with addiction related issues, those with mental health issues and concerns. Those individuals that struggle to adequately care for themselves and would truly benefit from a focused effort to get them back on the righttrack, will benefit from the judicial intervention that will allow first responders to be able to refer people to the CARES Court program. The CARE Court program will allow for those for whom it may be difficult or even impossible to take the first step towards making major changes to their lives be connected with services in up to 24months of care and treatment that will help them lead to a path of stabilization and help fully independent living. The one thing that I think is is really important to note is we have so many different collaborative court processes that are available in the state of California, whether it's homeless court, white court, which is whatever it takescourt, drug court and now care court are systems that are designed to help support people as they go through a process to connect with services, to get the support they need to be able to transition from one place in their lives to another in a position of strength and support.And this seems to do that. Although Councilman supervised, correct? It's so early in the process, I don't know exactly how it's going to work out, but local control would be great. But if CARE Court is similar to any other collaborative court or any other judicial intervention model, it's going to be a collaborative effort that is going tohave to come through the county in many ways, because the county is going to be the county that places the order upon the individual and orders a specific treatment plan. I know that this process is expected now to start with the legislature, and I know that there's a timeline that's anticipated to go with that.My biggest concerns are the costs associated with this. And so I'm hoping that city staff can continue to track this legislation, if we will, if we write this off or if this letter of support so that we're mindful of what those costs will be.And we can advocate for L.A. County, which will be the justice system that this CARE court will be administered out of, is sufficiently funded to be able to accommodate all those who might be able to need and benefit from this treatment.So I want to thank Councilman Super now for bringing this item forth and really huge applause for the governor for being innovative in terms of connecting people with services that they need. Becoming stabilized, whether it's from substance abuse or mental health, is something that often does require judicial intervention to get people to that place.And I'm grateful for this path. Thank you.All right. I saw Councilwoman Cindy Allen raise her hand. Councilwoman?Yes. I just want to also say thank you to Councilmember Supernormal for including me on this item. We know that a significant number of homeless individuals in our street are in desperate need of additional mental health services and care.And this item explores how we can better care for people in need within our community. And the L.A. County Board of Supervisors voted today unanimously to support the CARE Court program. So just thank you again, Councilman Supernormal, for bringing us for this great item.Thank you.Thank you. Before we I. I see you councilman's and any other comments inside the chambers?I have comments.How do we signal to you here?I was going to go to the people in the dais first, then we'll come here. So, Councilwoman Durham before.Her.It's a matter of trust. Okay. So thank you. This hybrid is a learning process. So first one of the thing, councilmember student Sabrina for bringing the item forward with the COA coauthors of the bill. I mean this item, you know, I do appreciate bringing this forward so that we can have conversation about what we're doing in thiscrisis that we have around our homelessness challenge that we face. And I think that while this is early on, I think, you know, we kind of started that conversation with I think the vice mayor had brought kind of a mental health item and how do we localize it from county to mental?So I hope that our staff would look into that as well. In addition to how are we going to partner with the state better as part of the housing plan? Because as much as we're able to provide a variety of mental health services that we can look into, ultimately all of them will need homes, stable homes inorder to be able to recover and I think get back on a healthy path. So I think that to me needs to, in addition, be looked at. And I just want to mention, you know, there is there is a fine line that I'm processing between why I do understand the need to do some level of, you know, insisting people get services and treatment to whether where it's voluntary. I think it's really important then that we look into it and consider what that means and what that looks like in a way where I think it's respectful for everybody and that's a healthy process.Right. So so those are my comment and I look forward and how we can learn more and our local city can can see how we can take steps forward in some of these consideration that we're sharing on at the dias at the moment.Thank you.Certainly. Thank you. Councilman Austin.Thank you. And also I want to thank Councilmember Supernova in the COSIGNERS for bringing this forward. Obviously, this was I see this as a welcome approach to a very serious mental health and behavioral health crisis facing our streets today and exacerbating our homelessness crisis.Make no mistake about it. I want to thank you, Councilman Suber, not for for bringing it up and reminding us that we've been moving forward in a state would have failed realignment strategy for over 50 years now. And I think this really must.We need to stop it and stop it now. I will say that I think we need to be fully engaged here at the city council to ensure that whatever is decided in Sacramento, it comes with the necessary local funding support that we need, whether it's going to the county or directly to the city or pass through.We have a health department which uniquely positions this city to do a lot more than others. I think we need to look at building capacity for community, community care support, and I know we are doing that simultaneously. And I think this is going to be will require a major reprioritization of our state resources today to provide thenecessary care to literally thousands of people that are that needed on the streets today. So this item has my support, my full support. And I know that there's going to be a robust conversation in Sacramento in terms of how this looks.And I think we as a city council, our city needs to be a major stakeholder at that table. Thanks.Thank you, Councilwoman Sylvia.Thank you, Vice Mayor, for the opportunity. I just want to give a huge thank you to Councilmember Supernova and Councilwoman Allen and Councilmember Price for bringing this item forward. I think it's very important, especially right now in the times that we are living in right now.This is a continuous, continuous problem in the downtown area and in the first district as a whole. One of the things that I feel is that we have individuals experiencing homelessness who are suffering from mental illness and may not have the capacity to accept services.But it is our responsibility as leaders to try to help them get off the street and get into on a pathway to secure housing. So I just want to thank you for bringing this up. And Gavin Newsom has in multiple occasions expressed one of his top priorities in the in our state is addressing the growing homelessness concernthat is impacting nearly every one of our communities throughout the state. And we are and we all know this very well, the pandemic only exacerbated the already existing issue around the need for secure housing, the need to be able to feel safe and decent and living decent standards, and also to please individuals.And, you know, with mental health needs in even more vulnerable circumstances, to be able to place them in programs that will uplift them and help them get out of the path that they may be in right now. So with that said, I'm very, very hopeful for this program.This is something that we need to focus on. I hope that we continue keeping a close eye on it. But I do have some questions that that maybe you, the staff, might be able to answer some of these questions.It may be too early to even have an answer for. But also, these are some of the questions that some of my residents have been asking in regards to peer courts, first of all, and maybe I'll ask in like three questions and then if I have to queue up again, I will.But some of my residents would like to know, first off, when with the care for Fremont go into effect, if it comes to the legislature, that may be too early of a question. And also, what does outpatient model look like or can this.And if we don't have those answers right now, right now, maybe we can keep an eye out for those answers.Our director of Health and Human Services, Kelly Collopy, will do her best.Good evening, council members. So the the primary the. So it still needs to go to a vote. And at that point, there will have to be a lot of design and work. So it's not really clear yet as to when it will be implemented.We would be working very closely with the county in this process and the ability to look at referral systems and service systems and others as part of that process. And in terms of of outpatients, so it really provides different opportunities for people to engage based on the level of service need.So an outpatient opportunity could be, you know, weekly meetings with a counselor. It could be everyday meetings, it could be, you know, multiple days. So it really it can be a lot of different opportunities. But generally, outpatient is not a place that you stay overnight.And so it can be you know, there's a lot of other opportunities from there. Um, I don't know. Do you have anything you want to add to that? Okay. Thank you.Right. Thank you, Councilmember. Any other comments?I was the. Okay. What exactly is the expectations that is being set for the city? How will this seat measure what? Whether or not a local jurisdiction has met their specified duties? And what exactly are those duties?And remember, I don't think those are identified yet. So the local jurisdictions for this purpose right now as they're being mined, says County. And so I don't know what at a at a sub a sub local jurisdiction that looks like as a city.But we don't have any of those in place at this time.Thank you very much. And I knew some of this was premature, that I wanted to get them out there just in case. But thank you very much for your help. And thank you. Thank you. And again, thank you to the maker of the motion.All right. Thank you. But in at bat, my support here, I certainly can't support this sort of you know, I'm a family member and, you know, it's hard to the sort of judicial process is very hard to navigate, even for family members who have someone who's sort of caught up in the mental health, drug addiction space.It's very difficult to navigate. So having a court that's designed to specialize in this and tap into diversion, I think it makes sense. The governor's bottom line. I thanks counsel Mr. Bernoff for agreeing. Of course, we can endorse the state program.In November we took a step. I think this dovetails very well with some of the work that we're doing here in Long Beach in November. We took a step and we asked staff to begin looking at a whole menu of items that we could localize away from the County Department of Mental Health locally.And those discussions are going well. And we just did a study. And so my question for staff is how can this dovetail into this broader discussion about localizing mental health and where are we with that, if you could provide an update.So this is Tom. I'll start. Yes, we do see that there is synergy here. The council did ask us to look at how we can work on mental health, and this definitely fits into that. And we think this is a very good proposal.We do have resources. The council just allocated $100,000 last month to be able to start on that study. And we see moving this kind of components about how we can be involved into that study. So I will turn it over to Kelly to answer more on progress.Good evening. So in terms of the parties, we have been hosting meetings both with the Department of Mental Health and we're in sort of spite with the we are meeting with our local mental health representatives as well as those in the Executive Office at the Department of Mental Health, as well as with the Division of Substance Abuseor otherwise known as steps within the L.A. County Department of Public Health. So we've been meeting with both of those different teams to look at the ability to streamline resources, understand where the gaps are. We're also moving forward with identifying the advisory committee to this effort, and we anticipate that that meeting will be hopefully in the endof April, early May, as we start to move forward. And then we'll also be bringing on a consultant to support those efforts.Certainly. And that's all incredible progress. And I think thinking about the way the courts connect to this is incredibly important. So, so good work, everyone. Please remain focused on this mental health localizing the discussion.

So. Who wants to present.So I think that I think that a number of us have met with, as well as our city planner, has met with the Golden Gate, Audubon Society. They've done a lot of work here in Alameda, and specifically with our leashed terns and other bird sanctuaries in Alameda and have done a great job working towards conservation and wildlifecare standards in other cities, including San Francisco and Richmond. And they have put forward just basic language that would help advise potential developers, people building anything here in Alameda, different practices that could make their buildings bird safe. And I've I've also spoken with a number of other individuals who are architects, planners and developers.And a lot of these things end up coming up later in the process, in particular during the sequel process and other things. And so this would just codify it and put them on alert earlier on to some of the best practices and basic things that they can do to make their buildings bird safe.All right, so then. Well, here. Question member matter.So we're not giving people ideas. The purpose of this referral is to establish an ordinance that people have to follow, make buildings burn safe. Correct. Thank you.All right. Speakers. Marjorie Powell. Then. DeCarlo Annie. Patricia McCann and. Cindy Margolis. And then they are a fat, skinny. Go ahead. All right.Thank you.Mayor Spencer, members of the council.My name is Marjorie Powell.I've been a resident of Alameda.Now for just over.Three years. We selected.Alameda out of the Bay.Area because of its.Wildlife friendly reputation.And because, frankly, I was familiar.With the LC.Romer Bird Sanctuary.Which is now.Across the street from where we live. Across the street from it, I guess I should say. I'm also a member of the Golden Gate, Audubon.Society and the.The Friends of the Alameda.Wildlife Reserve, which.Focuses on the least tern colony up at.Alameda Point. But I want to.Urge the Council to adopt an ordinance that in that requires.Planners to make their buildings bird safe.There are several reasons for this. First. If it is.An ordinance, then planners.Know ahead of time what they have have to comply with. And a number of planners have told.Golden Gate Audubon, as you will hear later in.Our testimony, that knowing ahead of.Time this is in fact.Not expensive, it there are many options that will make the building easier to heat and to cool.So it eventually.Saves money in the long run. But it's also important to note that there are three potential factors that would be involved in making buildings bird safe. Depending on the height of the building and the nature of the design of the structure.One is what you do with windows. Birds don't see glass, so they will fly into windows. That's important both for tall glass buildings, but also for lower buildings that have large glass. Because many areas in Alameda have nesting, breeding birds, and they're the ones who will crash into the building's windows that are lower down because they're movingquickly, particularly the smaller birds. So windows are one concern. Lighting is another concern. The lighting shouldn't be directed where it's not needed, particularly on to water, but also landscaping. If the building is a large building designed with an interior courtyard, you don't want windows that are going to.Be attracting birds.To fly into a landscaped interior courtyard. Speakers coming behind me will highlight many of these issues. But I did want to say that we think this is very important. It's not particularly difficult for architects to including in planning if they know ahead of time what they need to do.Thank you.Thank you. Linda. First, I want to thank you so much for spending 2/1 for.Staying so you could hear our request. We are really.Appreciative. So I'm Linda Colonia, a village in Alameda, about six years. I'm a member.Of the board of the Golden.Gate Audubon, and I'm the co-chair of the Friends of the Alameda Wildlife Reserve.And I just want to urge.You to adopt this referral to establish. Building standards to protect our birds. So glass in our built environment is a significant.Hazard to birds. 300 million birds are killed in building collisions.Each year in the United States.More birds.Are killed by collisions with buildings than.Any other single source other than free.Roaming cats. And Alameda is really a critical place for birds. We're right on the Pacific Flyway. We have these incredible.Shorebirds.And we have all.Kinds of birds that nest here. So it's really important for Alameda.And Alameda has a history.Of making.Environment and wildlife protection a priority from kind of creating the LC from sanctuary.To.Zoning, the wildlife reserve up on Alameda Point. So we think this is really the next step. As Marjorie said, it's competitive so long as you do it at the beginning.Both San Francisco and Oakland did this several years.Ago and Richmond just did.It.In November of last year. So we think it's time for Alameda to do this, too. Thank you for your time and I hope you'll adopt the referral. Thank you.I guess.Good morning. City council members. I'm Patricia again, and I also am a member of Golden.Gate Autobahn.And the friends of.The Alameda Wildlife Refuge Reserve. And I also.Just strongly endorse.This bird building.Anti bird safe building ordinance.This would establish Alameda as credentials.As a bird friendly.City and could encourage nearby communities.To do the.Same. Please move forward. And while I am here, I am also supporting the city, exploring taking title to the uncompleted strip of Shoreline Park, which also would be good.With.An agenda.Okay. Thank you. These lips. I just noticed these lips we should actually had, like on hers. That has agenda item nine and nine city. Okay. And then Cindy's has nine A and nine. See also. And then the one's nine.Yeah. We combine nine B's.Okay.Well, we'll make another one.Okay. There's two of them. All right.Hey. Thank you all for hanging late. I really appreciate it. And so do all of us. The reason this is so urgent is because there are so many development plans in Alameda. And so it's very important that we get ahead of the development cycle so that we don't add additional costs to the developers who want to developin an environmentally responsible way. In Alameda. As some of the speakers have told you, the wildlife cohort in Alameda is incredibly special. It's actually very special relative to all the other Bay Area. So we have more than 200 species which live just at the refuge alone, just in that little section of Alameda have been seen.So if you take the whole island and the cross-section of all the different varieties across the island, there's a lot of different birds. That includes endangered species, threatened species, species of special concern. These are birds you really don't want to lose.And we've used birds as a harbinger of the environment for all Alameda schoolchildren. So we've had a program for years where we're going into the schools and educating the kids about the birds. And they get so excited thinking that they're special birds in their own community.And it helps them identify with the community and with the nature that's around them. As this other speaker said, it's the second leading cause of bird mortality, and it's totally preventable with a smart ordinance. I am going to encourage that.The city of Alameda take a leadership role nationally on this topic, and it's actually not very difficult. So three other Bay Area cities within our catchment of Golden Gate Audubon have adopted these as well as some in the South Bay.But what you are able to do based on the science which was provided, which is in the referral packet from Cal Academy, that study establish that the standards for bird safe windows should be a little bit smaller in terms of single plate design.So you can have multiple plates, but each individual plate of a certain size should be mitigated in some way. It doesn't mean you can't use glass, it just means the glass has to be mitigated properly. If you do that, Alameda is able to take a national prominent role on this, which is a very important statement for acity that holds the most important protective colony of an endangered species in the nation. And the American Bird Conservancy has assured me that they will step up with Alameda and declare how important what you've done is. So I am going to ask that the planner take that additional step of the leadership position because of the bird lifethat is so special in the city, adopting the bird safe building would govern all new construction. And as we're looking at increased density of housing, one of the things that's going to make Alameda so special is our shoreline and our access to public space and birds become a way to connect people to those spaces.And what you don't want to do is build a bunch of buildings that are going to have dead birds outside their windows. So this solves a lot of problems for the city. It reconnects the city with its island heritage, with the wildlife around us, and with the beautiful shoreline that we enjoy as an island city.In addition, there were priority around dark-sky and lighting is another important factor. That's part of the bird safe constellation, if you will, part in the face of issues that were talked about. So there's buildings, there's lighting, and there's also the relationship of the landscape to the building as those things relate to each other.And this would solve that in the way that other cities have solved that. No up lighting, no downloading, no water lighting, but lighting for security. Thank you very much.Thank you. All right. So she's our last speaker on the nine A, if I'm reading this correctly, your. Now are there's nine be. I'm sorry on this form.Good morning. I am not going to speak much because.You are sorry for this already. I'm sorry. Before you continue. So she's speaking on nine. B is. But the slip says.We agree to continue.So I didn't know that. Or is that okay? Work is perfectly fine, right? Yeah. Okay, then. Go ahead. Thank you.I just wanted to say I'm. Especially excited to see Almeida potentially join the growing list of people that are concerned about bird safe buildings and cities that have adopted ordinances already. And I think it's especially fitting to have this decision made in April when we have Earth Day and we have a lot of friends birthday and alot of a lot of attention toward. Our natural resources. And I'm here tonight just to say hello and hope you support us. Thank you.Thank you. And hello. So she's our last speaker on. So we have other speakers online. So then do you want to hear about them or an online? Okay, Pat Lambrew, I'm 90 also. So if anyone was here on nine A or nine be.I did already call you.I wasn't sure. So we combined nine B, 99 D, I think we've probably said enough. Then I was going to just mention how important landscaping and trees are in conversations with folks who live right near a well-lit building.They have been in a long conversation to get ahead. There is some speaking up for the hedge. Thank you.Okay. Thank you. All right.So may I suggest may are you? You said there was a slight nuance difference. Maybe you can explain that. And then maybe we can dispose of this before.The night on 99. So I did a separate referral because I want to make sure I actually from reviewing the Golden Gate Audubon website, they have make the city safe for wildlife. And they have multiple things. They have the buildings standards for bird safe buildings, but then they also have tree care and bird safety tree care, andthen they have lights as another thing. So the artificial light and referred speakers on all those. So I wanted to make sure we're looking at a comprehensive. Effort to protect our wildlife. So in addition to the word safe buildings and and I have previously done referrals for the artificial light and the trees.And I, you know, I I'm hopeful that we could. Look at the whole appetite for birds. And the other two, the artificial light and the trees were ranked as medium level on our priority thing. And I don't know where we're going to put this, but I would hope that we're providing a good habitat as well as looking, you know, the trees, lighting and build building safety together, which is why I yeah. And I did my seven to make sure we're doing a comprehensive effort here.And I think the sample basic draft for the Alameda Bird Friendly Ordinance Framework, which is one of the attachments, includes things on the importance of landscaping and feature related standards as well, including atriums, greenhouses, things like that, as well as the lighting aspect I think.I hope that that addresses some of the concerns, I think. My hope is that this this gets folded in with some of the other elements that we're looking at and so that we get something that's comprehensive instead of something that's piecemeal.That's why I was bringing it to you as a comprehensive effort. I appreciate hearing that. Vice Chair.I mean, I would agree with the vice mayor that I think the the draft ordinance from Richmond accomplishes that. I mean, I would like to be able to have us celebrate that we're nationally recognized for this effort. So to the extent that there's extra things that are not in that Richmond ordinance, then I'd be in favor ofthat. But, you know, not to pontificate for too long because it is late. But, you know, we do care about our wildlife here. And, you know, we've done a lot of work. Councilmember Matt Arrestee. I mean, taking the lead on protecting the SEALs.Mm hmm. So, I mean, that that's really strong. And I, you know, just real quick, I remember I was out there on first sight over the weekend, and I remember getting distracted by just watching this bird play in the sand.And I was supposed to be paying attention to the property owners. But so I do think this is an important thing. And I know it's kind of a small thing, but, you know, all of our wildlife is important.So I think it's important we take this the step.So it sounds like I may have heard that. So if you're agreeable to combining them somehow so that we are looking at a comprehensive partnership, and that's just that's what I want, but I want to try to make sure we're doing that.Yeah. And I mean, we're going to look at where this fits in the priority that we established. And also it will go to our city planner right to to look at. And we you know, I want to know what all the considerations are.And I have met with a lot of these ladies out here, the advocates. But we need to find out from a practical matter, what will that mean in terms of. You know what? More financial pressure on developers. We've had a little experience lately about how, you know, the changing landscape, but oftentimes you can meet a lot ofcriteria. But yeah, well, yeah, that's something that our planning department.Can take a look at. That's. Oh, yeah.So do you want to set a priority on where this fits in?And may I suggest that it's a medium just like the lighting ordinance.Yes.And I think it might.And I'm right. I move that we adopt a we give direction to a to consider a comprehensive. A bird friendly ordinance with protections for other wildlife as consideration is referred to. And I can be.I'll second.That. And and just by way of discussion, if we were looking at applicable criteria, I think that this is a referral dependent on other city projects or work efforts because I know we are there is an effort in planning to update a number of our codes.So oftentimes work product can be grouped together just saying sometimes it helps to look at applicable criteria. Thank you.The medium status.With medium.Priority. Yes, we have a second. Second. And so then I just want to clarify. So we're actually combining 99 versus. Yes, yes. All right. All those in favor. I motion carries unanimously and we've disposed of nine B now we can go to nine C.Consider directing staff to prepare for it.Thanks for waiting.On the city of Alameda acquiring.Taking title the uncompleted strip of Shoreline Park next to Harbor Bay.Parkway.All right. And I brought this referral. That's pulling up and we have one speaker on this and an and this is considered directing staff to prepare a report on the city of Alameda acquiring or taking title to the uncompleted strip of Shoreline Park next to the Harbor Bay Parkway.And some background is as the proposed hotel was being discussed at Bccdc, there was discussion of the strip and and it wasn't really clear it was being discussed as a benefit of building the hotel. But it really wasn't clear that this, in fact, is actually the city's as they are.This is something that the city could take possession of, is my understanding from the discussion. And so I brought the referral because I'd like us to consider taking possession of it just on our own and seeing what the if that's a possibility and the costs involved.And so that's why I brought this. Now we'll have our speaker, Pat Lamborn.Thank you all so much. Thanks to the entire city council for staying and including this and the nine, A, B, and C, thank you to the city staff for staying so late. And thank you to my sisters from the Golden Gate, Audubon Society.\nSummary:", "answer": "Consider Adopting a “Bird-Safe Buildings” Ordinance.

This is one of the places that we discussed a lot in the work this council did, along with sound transit board members and others throughout the region, leading to Sound Transit, putting the Sound Transit three ballot measure forward and that set of projects.There was a lot of talk, as you may recall, about what are the things that we can do as a city and other jurisdictions can do to coordinate better, streamline the process to both reduce costs for expanding light rail and perhaps more importantly, reduce the time line it takes to deliver it.I believe this memorandum of understanding reflects the ongoing, strong relationship that Seattle Department of Transportation has built with sound transit, things like how we work together on utility corridors, whether it's Seattle City, later Seattle Public Utility or right away that Seattle Department of Transportation owns or other ways the city interacts with light rail authority are important.And I also think it's something that we will continue to build upon and improve if voters do pass that on transit three this fall to allow us to continue to streamline that process so that we can get light rail in our communities as soon as possible.Thank you, Councilman O'Brien.

Kieran Reside, Nadia Tushnet, Leanna Noble, Holly Stewart, Myron Wallen and Cynthia think doesn't see us.Please come forward. Are those folks here?Karen Reside, a resident of the First District. The last couple of weeks. I'm going to share stories that what I'm seeing from this relocation fee. The landlords are not telling the tenants about it. I have people coming to me at the senior center.They don't know anything about the relocation payments. The landlords are also not giving them any instructions about it either. Out of six tenants that I've talked to in the last two weeks. Only one person was.Given a piece of.Paper. That mentioned the relocation payment and that they might be eligible. So they have no idea. The landlords are not telling the tenants what this is for. And I'm hoping that this motion is not to. Take away benefits from people that need them very badly and the landlords are still giving out eviction notices.So that's another issue, too. So I hope that we're going to have a discussion that's going to create an opportunity to discuss these elements and come up with some solutions. Nadir Tushnet and I live in the third district.Sorry, Susie. The third district. I am. I do support the $250,000. But in my work with seniors, a lot of them don't even know that it exists. So I think that this needs to be amended and it also needs an enforcement mechanism that landlords need to tell seniors and disabled individuals about the ability to access some moneyto help them relocate. There are other issues, but this is the one that I keep hearing about. If I'm the one telling people there's something wrong and.I think.That it should be from the city. Thank you.Thank you. Lee and Annabelle.I'm a downtown resident. I'm here also as a member of the advisory board of Libra. And the message is very clear, amend and continue to protect the residents of your city. Do not repeal.Which equals abandoning.The residents of your city. In my downtown neighborhood, there are no less than five buildings in the last.Eight months that have been.Completely empty. That is more than 100 families that were my neighbors. They were kicked out.Something was done to the apartments.It wasn't easy to tell what and the rent was jacked up. So those are a hundred of my neighbors who had been forced out of Long Beach.We have now a good state law. All we need to do is to make that.Law absolutely.Recognized.Here and to keep the current amount and formula that we have for relocation.Benefits.That will put you standing with the majority of the people who live here in our town who are residents.

There is better addiction protection.We just heard from other people from a few minutes ago.By the way, I'm a senior.Citizen of the 80 years old in January. And I care a lot about these things because I see people my age being put out in the street and none of you should be responsible for that because you shouldn't be.The Grinch stole Christmas by getting rid of this protection we need for the people who are under threat. Thank you very much. Keep it amended. Keep it so that people are protected from eviction and from rent increases and keep the money up there so people can relocate when they do have to.Thank you very much. Thank you.Myron Wallace right here. So before Cynthia speaks, Maria Lopez, Alex Flores, Jonathan Gibson and Gretchen Swanson. In that order, please come forward. Ray Lopez is here. Alex Flores, Jonathan Gibson and Gretchen Swanson. Thank you.Good evening. City Council and Mayor Garcia. My name is Cynthia macias and I am a member of the second District and also.The board president for housing Long Beach as a housing advocate who worked in good faith.With this council to pass the tenant below.This past June. Excuse me. To be honest, I'm very disgusted. Is sadly not surprised that you are would deliberately undermine all the hard work of fellow orgs and community members because this is what it looks.Like to us.You all claimed an urgency about keeping families and homes for the holidays and thus passed the moratorium. Was that done just to appease your conscience because you knew.You would repeal.Reload right afterwards?If so, shame on all of you.Of course, except Mary Sun has, because she was not here. But you all have a duty to your constituents, and I hope you do what's best for them, which is amending the Long Beach Reload Ordinance to incorporate state Senate protections in its entirety except to keep the Long Beach hire relocation assistance amounts, do surgery with a.Scalpel, not a hacksaw. And as far as the senior citizens.I work with these senior citizens all the time.And it's not about the money. There's no ADA accessible.Units.For them as well. And we have to think.About the bigger picture.Not just the money.Thank you. Thank you. Relevance, please.Good evening, city council and Mayor. My name is Maria, and in the time of breaking glass ceilings, I'd say I'm undocumented, unafraid and unapologetic. I migrated to Long Beach at the age of three into District one, and now I'm the director of community organizing for housing lobbies and organizing with the Long Beach Tenants Union.I have been connecting with tenants through organizing for the past three years, and one of the biggest wins was our Tenant Relocation Assistance Ordinance. Tenants organized, unified came to council with their stories and their pain, and on June 11th, they took home a win to mitigate displacement for thousands of families in the city of Long Beach.A repeal of such fundamental policy that those directly affected advocated for. On the Week of Homeless Awareness. Veiled itself as a direct undermining of these stories and these families. This is why we asked for an amendment of this policy to keep the promise and commitment to the majority renters city.The amendment is simple incorporate this that the Tenant Protection Act in its entirety at SAP to keep the Long Beach hire relocation assistance amounts as it helps to mitigate the impacts for tenants. This is a common sense approach as it is completely legal feasibly under the TPPA because the amendment ordinance would be more protective than TPA dueto its higher relocation assistance amounts. Again, when renters rise cities.Thank you for your support today.And next week or please.Good evening. This is Alex Flores. I'm an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation working out of our Long Beach office. I wanted to talk real quickly about the Tenant Protection Act and the fact that it allows to do it.Most of the speakers have been talking about, which is amend the ordinance. The Tenant Protection Act is clear. It is a floor. It specifically details what a city must do in order to make a more protective ordinance. Section g1b is very clear and it's very easy.What it would require is a city to pass an ordinance with an ordinance which says that they are passing the Tenant Protection Act with no changes, not making it weaker in any way that they're adding something higher like relocation amounts, which is an example already in the Tenant Protection Act itself.And three are binding finding that their ordinance is more protective because of that higher amount. So instead of repealing the relocation ordinance, what the city can do is simply pass that ordinance and make sure that these higher amounts of relocation, which have already capped a lot of tenants that have come into our office in their homes, thatthose tenants don't lose that protection. Thank you. Thank you.Jonathan. Jonathan Gibson and Gretchen Swanson.Good evening. My name is Jonathan Gibson. I'm a Long Beach resident and a Lafleur's staff attorney. I want to talk a little bit about the city's ordinance and how important it is. It gives two months of relocation assistance, whereas the TPA is a good start, only gives one month.Now, what does this mean for tenants? What we're seeing a lot is these no fault evictions for substantial renovations going through. And with the extra two months of relocation benefits, that means that someone can pay for their security deposit, first month's rent and moving costs.It's so much easier. The TPA, which is simply a four. When someone's facing eviction, these costs mount and this is incredibly important. Just one example we had recently was on Cedar Avenue, where we had tenants who had been living there for 30 to 40 years and they were evicted, but they were able to be given a softlanding by having this extra relocation assistance. And this should continue. It should not be abandoned. Thank you. Thank you.Next up is Gretchen Swanson. Before Gretchen speaks, the following folks in the lineup is Ailsa Chang here, Andrea Donato, Myra Garcia and Roberto Lopez and Jordan Wynne who is here. Ailsa Chang. Andrea Donato. Please line up. Myra Garcia and Roberto Lopez and Jordan win in that order.Thank you.Good call. Good evening. Gretchen Swanson, CD2 I am in support of my colleagues who just thought about maintaining and then building on the tenant protective effort here in the city of Long Beach. I want to speak particularly about the older adult and people with disabilities, a portion of it.First of all, the language is old. I was just recognized today by a board of county supervisors for the fact that I'm an expert in keeping older adults safe. So when I come here and look at something that is at best disingenuous, a security fund which they would get back, it boggles my mind that I live inthis city that is not addressing the needs. There was a whole group that just walked out of older adults that are disenfranchized from a process of protection. So we need a well defined program, not this security deposit fund, and we need someone to reflect that.We now have a council member who is an expert who has lived the life of housing needs, rental housing needs for people with disabilities. Let's reflect that. Let's use that and do something meaningful. Let's go to older adults and people with disabilities and ask them what they need.Not throw a couple thousand dollars at them and hope that we get that money back. Thank you.Thank you so much of the time.Good evening, honorable mayor and council members. My name is Ailsa Tang from Long Beach Forward. Now this past spring and summer, housing advocates worked in good faith with this council to pass tenant relocation assistance. And last month we worked in good faith again with this council to enact an eviction moratorium.And we thank you for that. But now we're here to repeal what we all worked so hard to pass. That's not right. Look, the staff report is crystal clear. It says, quote, Generally, the state regulation will apply to more tenants than the city regulation.And the city regulation will require higher relocation payments when it does apply. Indeed, Long Beach tenant rule adopted by this council allows double the relocation than the state to pay. So the solution is to take the best of both worlds.The solution is to amend, not repeal. Amend the Long Beach Ordinance to incorporate the State Tenant Protection Act in its entirety except to keep Long Beach's hire relocation assistance amounts. This is the cleanest and most effective way to comply with both state law and this council's intent to provide two months of relocation assistance to Long Beach tenants, especially those who face no fault evictions due to rehab of their unit. Those families we just protected under the eviction moratorium. Council members. A vote to amend is a vote to protect. A vote to repeal. As a vote to abandon.Do the right.Thing. Thank you very much. I decision not to please next speaker. I'm going to ask the rest of the folks who are here to line up. I know. I see Jordan went into the back after Jordan to be Marlene Alvarado.I think it is Malik Watson, Ivan Garcia and Andrew Montano. And that's the the final closing of the speaker's list is tomorrow.Good evening, Mayor and council members. My name is Andrew L.A. and I'm the associate director of the Long Beach Interfaith Community Organization. And I'm here with the same.Message to all my friends that have spoken. I will just like to encourage you.To step up on the leadership, on renters rights. That's an area looking to.An assistant was the.First to step up. That Long Beach took really long time to protect tenants in in Los Angeles County. We are already talking about the right to counsel there at 3% in rent control cap.And if you like the Long Beach, we are still.Trying to defend the little.That we have. So I highly encourage you to amend what we have to, as they have said, to keep the rates of the relocation assistant and to comply with the state law. Thank you so much.Thank you so much, Myra Garcia.We need an.Interpreter.Mr. Modica.I defer to the city clerk on whether interpreted services were requested for today.Why do we keep going? We'll get back to Promises. I thought we had an interpreter.Here, but yeah.There was an interpreter here for the swearing in ceremony. They did not stay for the entirety of the council meeting. We didn't receive a request in the office for a public comment.Well.So what do you want to say? But it comes in the months ahead. Okay, look, we'll do that a minute. Madam Clerk. We can just try to get a solution to that. Thank you. Very little.Hello, many. Hello. I'm Mayor and City Councilman Lopez, project director at Libre, and I am here to speak against the repealing of ten and below. I think a lot of the colleagues have said, you know, that this was a huge victory for tenants, especially for tenants who are already being displaced.And some of the tenants that you helped protect the last like two weeks ago. And at the end, they they'll be affected once again starting January 1st as they will receive the same notices that they received due to substantial rehab.We are asking you to now repeal, but amend the ten and reload to protect the larger group of renters that fall under AB 1482. Stand behind your words from June and continue to protect tenants and your city. The same tenants that you help protect this holiday season will be affected by this repeal.All tenants deserve higher relocation amounts. Long Beach Re Low amounts are unique. Long Beach Unique. The right thing to do is to protect our seniors and also members of our community with disabilities and our tenants. I really do hope that you do the right thing and help protect the tenants of your city, especially the ones that youjust recently helped protect. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Hi there. My name's Jordan Winn. I'm a resident of the second district. I want to echo the sentiments of my colleagues and urge you to not repeal this and to instead amend this.I wanted to address two points. One is a personal story. So, as you know, I recently moved from District seven to District two. I recently relocated, and I've been saving up for a while to actually do that. I wanted to focus in on the costs of moving.I moved into a two bedroom apartment and just to move in.It cost about $4,000.And if I were doing that, you know, in one fell swoop, if I was getting evicted, that would be much more difficult than what I actually had to do, which was save up for about a whole year to actually be able to do that.So I'm thinking of the families and people on fixed incomes, people who are working paycheck to paycheck, who are unable to pay for a new place to move, even with.The time that they have in the lower state amount. So this is one of the important reasons that I think.We should consider keeping our local element. The other thing that I want to say is this isn't the only time that.We're going to have to talk about how we enforce TPA and how our.City relates to it and the way in which our policies work around that. We're going to have to figure out enforcement mechanisms.So I think it's much smarter to.Amend rather than repeal. Don't do this haphazardly. Take some time to think about it. Don't throw it in right now and repeal it with. I like the chainsaw metaphor. We need to use a scalpel for housing policy. Thanks so much very much.Our next speaker, please. Marlene Alvarado.Is Venezuelan.Alvarado, District one. Don't repeal.Amend, keep the 2% monthly assistance of $4,500, especially for no fault eviction. If you need to save money because you know.We're going broke.You can take some of that money from the 48% of the budget.For the police department.Because according to 0 to 2000 people.Become homeless with a 5% rent increase. So with the amendment to.Keep the two month assistance, police services will be reduced with the senior and.And deceptively household security assistance program. I would like to know how does a tenant qualify for this program?How will the city ensure this program is rich and benefiting the city's most vulnerable.Seniors and persons with disability? How will the.Funding of this program be sustained over time? Well, the city come to fund the program.In order to leverage state.And federal funds. And I think it's really tacky of you to get rid of the $4,500 assistance program amend don't repeal.Thank you link Watson.Amendment Repeal Amendment bill. I can see. Hello, my name is Malik Watson, a son and a brother to a beautiful seven year old sister. My family and I are familiar to relocating to different areas and it's hard to find a stable home.We've moved to different areas in the city across the country for the past seven years I've lived in the riverside area, but now I'm back in, back in my home city I call home. And I am a part of the education system attending Long Beach Poly High School, even Central Elementary.Now that I've returned, I want to do my part and serve as an advocate for my community. You all yourselves have a connection to the city, whether it be because of your whether it be because of your position or due to your family.Just as much as you care for your family, we ask for you to care for us and amend, not repeal the ordinance for you to the ordinance for you to care for hours and amend, not repeal. Give me give me that.Just as much as you care for your family. We ask that you care for us and amend, not repeal the ordinance and incorporate the Tenant Protection Act, but keep Long Beach Haven relocation assistance amounts. Families are consistently displaced in the city and have difficulty finding another another home.This is why we need to hire relocation amounts to ensure our families remain connected and separated. I kindly request for you to amend, not repeal and keep the high relation amounts to provide justice for communities historically marginalized through racist policy practices.Thank you.Thank you. Next up is Ivan Garcia.Hello, Mayor. Hello, Council. My name is Ivan and I live in the First District. And I'm just going to start off by saying we don't need to send more people to live in the streets. We have too many of those people already.And by removing this protection, that would just only create.That effect that we want to.Avoid. Like as many others have said already, we all as a community have worked together to provide protections for these renters. That way, they don't have to save up so much money in so little time that they end up living on the street.And with that, I simply say that we should amend it. And amend it and look more deeply into it and make sure that we don't just repeal and therefore strip the protections away from these people in one fell swoop.And in this, like as someone else has said already, this is actually consistent with the TPA that was passed earlier this year. Therefore, in short, I simply say amend, do not repeal. And that's all for me. Thank you.Thank you.Andrew. Hello. My name is Andrew Montano with Long Beach Forward supporting the best large central Long Beach initiative. Over the past couple of months, I've gotten to witness families come together and pressure council to adopt an eviction moratorium to have them home for the holidays.Arriving at that building, you heard children laughing, crying, playing, saw them gathering around the table. We had set up outside waiting for their plate of food, not realizing the stress their parents were feeling. One of the small feelings of relief came when they realized they had access to an equitable amount of relocation assistance.If you repeal, you are harming those children who were in the arms of their mothers a few weeks ago. Where I'm standing right now, these tenants under our local law are eligible for 3000 to $325. Now, folks want to take that away and leave them with a third of that amount, not enough for a down payment, childcare, new rent, moving costs and many more expenses. According to a recent study, average rents rose 24.6% in a three year period and are likely to continue doing so in the future. And friends are rising and more people are rent burdened.Then the conversation shouldn't be around repealing our local law, but on amending it to incorporate the Tenant Protection Act and strengthening it further with our local relocation amounts and go as far as filling further gaps, like adopting a fresh right to refusal policy like the city of Berkeley to ensure families are able to return to the unitsafter substantial repairs are made, which is the type of no fault notice to vacate that sparked our eviction moratorium. Again, amend, not repealed.Also, there's another another Maria that signed up without. And we're going to go back to her home in San Antonio. Was there a second, Maria, that didn't leave a last name? And my miracle is miracles. Okay, so both.Both ladies, please come forward. Maria and Myra.Good evening, city council and mayor. My name is Maria Dela Cruz. I'm a resident at the district and I was one of the tenants that advocated for the Tenant Relocation Assistance Ordinance. This law was the first time I ever saw something that benefit renters and made me happy.I met other renters also fighting, which was powerful and beautiful. Repealing this law will erase this and we don't want that. We also want to be able to keep our relocation assistance amounts as they are higher today. Listen to those tenants like myself that fought for this law and meant to protect tenants and offer more financial financialsupport. Thank you for your time.I'm halfway through. So when I'm not through with Garcia, I think we need a central district, sort of, you know, if we want to modestly eliminate bazaar, inconveniencing maybe a mutual thing, which clearly, I swear you will not existed.But I mean, if you feel a little familiar. There are corridors of where we need to have it is Gucciardo Doral as Historias de la Familia in Lena Copperfield, Chipperfield Romero Little mural, those competitions as Historias Perabo their powerful installation.Ibaraki is the briefly Carolina city that is killing us all we know Karimov, Jerry Lee Pelosi, Kayleigh MCENANY, Fishkin, but oppo their kiranas countless country that is as he stands here.

Have half of it translated. So the other one I'll do verbatim. Good evening. My name is Myra Garcia.I am a tenant and resident of District two. I was one of the tenants who fought for this law and saw it passed June 11th. It brought me much happiness to know that a law existed for the benefit of families struggling and with low income.It was beautiful hearing the stories of families who are tenants and finally breaking through fear. Everyone shared their stories to pass a tenant reload that reflected the needs of community. Today, we don't want a repeal of our hard work, but we want it.But we do want is for it to be amended so we can keep our amounts dictated by the formula of the housing authority. This is very simple. What we want is to keep our local amounts so that tenants who are struggling can.Can still be protected by the strength of 1482 and our higher amounts. Thank you so much for your time. Again, we want a local policy with the with the protection of the 1482 and the same amount, the Limited Tenant Relocation Assistance Ordinance.Thank you.Thank you very much. Guests at a. One thing that that we didn't do as a staff report, which we jumped I jumped ahead to let me apologize for that and turn it over to Mr. Modica to do the staff report and then we'll move forward.And then I think that will clarify for the council kind of where this is at. So. Mr..MODICA Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So the reason that we're here tonight is to really talk about the tenant relocation ordinance, to give you a little bit of a history, and then the staff recommendation on to why we do believe that repeal of the city's local ordinances is in our best interest, and also to create a new programwhere we really are talking about providing additional assistance to senior and disabled. So on June 11th, 2019, the City Council adopted the Tenant Relocation Ordinance, and that really requires a rental property owner with four or more units to pay relocation assistance between 20 $700 and 4500.If you recall, there was a lot of community discussion that went into that. There were a lot of things that were either included or excluded, depending on all the public input that we heard. Essentially what it boils down to is if you receive a notice of rent increase of 10% or more in any 12 consecutive month, youwould be eligible if you received a notice to vacate due to the landlords rehabilitation of the unit, you'd be eligible. And if you were in good standing and received a notice of non-renewal or notice to vacate, it's important to notice.Note that this is a tenant relocation assistance program but does not restrict rent increases and did not require just cause for termination. And so what happened after we passed ours, we spent a good deal of time really crafting something that worked for for our community, as we have seen in the past.When local cities take the lead on these big, big issues, the state often then comes afterwards and and kind of on the heels of a progressive city says, we're going to do something that will be applied statewide. We've seen that happen with polystyrene.We've seen or I'm sorry, with plastic bags, for example. We've seen it happen with minimum wage and that happened here as well. And so the state basically took effect, a bill that's going to take effect January one, 2020, and has two major provisions.Essentially, it prohibits annual rent increases of 5% or more. Plus the change in CPI or 10%, whichever, is lower. And then it also requires that landlords and they only terminate tenancies if they have just cause, which is significantly different than our local ordinance and provides additional renter protections.It includes at fault just cause is the tenant violation of a lease or a no fault just cause where the owner can terminate under a certain requirements. And so the state regulation also includes rent control and just cause provisions, which is significantly more protections for tenants than what the city ordinance had been crafted since it was adifferent framework. And so the dilemma is that if nothing changes, we're going to have two sets of laws on the books. One is the state law that applies statewide. And then there would be a city law that would basically be superseded in most cases by state law, except for in very slim areas.We do believe that this is going to cause a lot of confusion for both landlords and for tenants who don't know which one applies in which case. And that in general the relocation required under the state is going to apply to more tenants and actually be more money.There are certain instances where the city's ordinance would apply and have a small a an increase, a higher payment amount. And we'll show you what we expect those numbers to be. Just so you can get a sense of the magnitude.So to walk through the finer details, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick here, who will go through a couple of charts on how we believe the ordinances or the laws would work and, you know.Would each work. Thank you, Tom. Mayor and City Council. This chart shows how the city relocation triggers are impacted by the state regulation. The first two triggers of the city's relocation ordinance basically will be rendered inoperable by the state regulation.That is, the relocation upon a rent increase of 10% or greater, or the relocation assistance when a tenant in good standing receives a notice of non-renewal or a notice to vacate. The third city trigger requires a relocation assistance upon removal or relocation of the unit, and that is effectively the only trigger that will be remaining now oncethe state regulation takes effect. The state regulation offers both rent control and just cause provision and applies to single family, duplex and triplex units. The city regulation effectively applies to apartment buildings with four units or more, but now only two units where tenancy is terminated until rehabilitation.Prior to adoption of the state regulation, about 49,000 units were covered by the city regulation. Based on building permit data that staff assembled. We estimate that 6.75% of rental units in the city are being rehabilitated annually. So the number of units now covered by the city regulation is actually much lower.6.75% of that 49,000 equates to 3311 units. But in reality, we think that the actual number of units that will be vacated is much less. The state regulation will assist more than 69,299 households. The city. The city regulation includes a requirement that landlords notify the city when entire buildings are are vacated in the first quarter of implementationof the city's policy. That's August through October of 2019. It was reported to us that a total of 45 units were vacated. That is a small sample, but it's the only sample we have. That is true telling of the units that are being vacated in the market.And if you take that 45 unit number and extrapolated over the full year, that would result in 180 units that would likely be vacated due to rehabilitation. That's about 5.5% of the 3311 units. I'll turn it back over to Tom.Thank you, Patrick. So while we are recommending, given those numbers and the way that the ordinances and laws interact, that we are recommending that you repeal it, but we also are making a recommendation that you enhance one particular area that we've really seen through the community conversations as being the biggest area of need.This is an area we would go beyond what the state requires and have a program in Long Beach set up for our seniors and disabled residents who can be, you know, have needs beyond what we believe the state is going to provide.And so what we're requesting is authority to create a senior and disabled security deposit assistance program for qualified lower income households. We are still working on this program. This you would be giving us direction to create it and come back to you with the final funding sources.We expect this to be non general fund but have about $250,000 combined out of federal home dollars, as are housing dollars and the state homeless prevention assistance and housing funds that we will be getting later in 2020. And so we imagine that this fund would be providing assistance to our most vulnerable populations and go beyond the stateprotections. The exact amount of subsidy and how that would work and where they would come. Those are all things that we're continuing to work on and we would give you a report back. But it was pretty clear the council really wanted to do this in the in the first part, but we didn't really have a mechanism todo it. So this is we've been putting our heads together to get to the goal of what you had said was one of your highest priorities in this. And so the next thing we're asking is the next steps.We are requesting that you tell the city attorney to prepare an urgency ordinance to repeal this code so that it can line up with the implementation date of the state law, which goes into effect January one. So we would repeal as of December 31st, you would direct the city manager to create that fund, that $250,000 fund, identifythe funding sources and get that created and underway and report back to you that you would work with the city attorney to prepare the urgency ordinance and bring that back and identify and fund the program that we've talked about.So with that, we are available to answer questions.Thank you, Councilmember Richardson.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So, first of all, thank you to the public for coming out and speaking on this issue. It's been a we've been talking about this issue for a long time, and many of you iterated that.And I want to thank staff for really following and being a part of this conversation and picking up where the council wants to go. The conversation here was not about not about removing protections. When we started this conversation, the city manager mentioned this.When we started the conversation, there were no state protections. And as the state developed their protections, there was a, you know, a lot of disarray in the market and in fact, a lot of people. And there was significant interest in having a very clear policy and rules of the road on January 1st of January 2nd, and avery clear policy, the state policy, we did a moratorium to make sure people are protected until that kicks in. And then we're coming in today and the city staff is presented a repeal to go to the state policy in the areas where city staff heard from counsel, from the public that it needs to be enhanced.Seniors and disabled individuals, those you know, we've created a way to enhance one policy with enhance the policy with a local fund. It's not burdened by the public, not administered by the public and by the private sector, but administered publicly now in many ways.And I think I think staff are putting forward the table in many ways. In most ways, the state regulation is superior to our local law. More people are covered under the state law. Our policy does not have a hard just cause backstop.The state has a just cause backstop. That means that it protects more people than what our original Long Beach policy did. It also has a lower threshold on the rent cap. Ours wasn't a rent cap. It was 10%.But it wasn't a cap. If you pay higher than that, you have to pay reload. There is a cap in the state of 5% and it's a period in many ways for renters and what we have here locally.So the narrative of this is a take away. It is not. Now, the public has done a really good job in educating us on some some, you know, areas where, you know, we might need to do more work.The rules of the road here are about clarity. So the recommendation is to is to repeal. Now, as a part of the second part, where it says create a senior disabled household security deposit program. That's where the enhancement is and that's where the really the opportunity is.So on, you know, in the staff report, the line just below table, it says, as can be seen above, the city wrote The city regulation in the higher reload amount will only apply when it is asked to vacate due to rehabilitation.That's a narrow there's a universe and we did a little work. It's not really a big group of people. It's a small group of people that we that we know that would receive essentially one month of rent in the new law instead of two months.Right. And that's not what the intention was here. Right. So so I must recommendation. I'm going to ask Rich and I had a conversation when we looked at and we found these are the very people who brought this issue forward.The idea wasn't to cut you out the ideas we know we want to expand the protections to everybody and be under one law that a conversation the mayor had a conversation with rich about is it a way to make sure that what that difference is and that very narrow universe we're talking about can this find can actuallycan we bring back options, bring back a solution for this fund to help people under that very narrow scenario? We still have one policy. The rules of the road are the same, but we add an additional enhancement. Can we bring back options for that rich.Mayor and council members? We certainly can. And I, in turn, have had a conversation with staff to ensure that that is something that we can do. So basically the direction, as I understand it, Council Member Richardson is in addition to an enhanced program for the elderly and the disabled.As staff recommended. Staff should also look into the addition of a city funded, enhanced either relocation payment or security deposit assistance for people that received re low under the state program because they received notice of termination of tenancy due to rehabilitation.We would effectively be trying to address through a city administered program and I'm sorry I'm going on long, but I want to be clear so everyone knows exactly what we're talking about. We would effectively be trying to address through a city administered program the exact people that would otherwise be getting a smaller relocation payment due to thisrepeal.In our initial sort of review of where the gap is and where the staff report is really a very narrow group. And so if we can make sure that that group moving forward has access to that fund, so they essentially receive the same amount, whether it's in the form of down payment assistance or not down payment, excuseme, running issue in the form of security deposit assistance or in the form of a reload. We want them to be able to have the same amount and we want that to be a part of the fund, not something that we pass on to the landlord.Exactly. That's something I think we can do.Let me let me clarify one thing to just just to be sure. I think what's important here and I want to I want to just echo something that that Councilman Richardson said is the state policy in in 99% of the time is going much further than what we obviously adopted as a as a city.And what there is a and in fact, I know that some folks had mentioned that the state re low amount is less than the city amount. That only is the case in a very, very narrow piece of that whole pie.In fact, dramatically more people will get the higher reload payment that the state has than the than the city currently allows for. And so I think what Councilman Richardson is describing is there is a very small piece of the pie.It could be, you know, and obviously, depending looking at the numbers, it could change year to year. But it's always going to be a very small group of folks that in the current system of repeal would receive a different tenant reload benefit when in fact a vast majority of folks would almost all the time receive much moreof the tenant reload. I just want to clarify that we think that is correct and. And so I think what what Councilman Richardson is describing is that it could be and you and I have discussed this number. This number could be as low as ten folks a year.It could be one building, but it happens in a certain year, could be 40 units a year. It's really dependent. It could be higher than that depending on what the building size is. But it's really on this issue of what do what does rehab on the tenancy issue and how that's affected by the higher we low amount. Is that correct, Mr. Modica?Yes. So that's our understanding as well. I think that was well put that we really don't expect that portion of the city's law to to come into effect that often. We can certainly look at the request to modify and add those people who would be affected there into the $250,000 fund.I do want to point out that the way that we have identified some the resources for this, it can't be used for tenant reload. It is done for housing assistance for qualified households. So we would take them and put them into the as a as an area of of eligibility provided they meet with those funding sources.Or if we find that that's not a case, we'll have to come back to you on a different approach on how to fund that.And I think, again, the request, as simple as just how do you address that, that small sliver of folks.We want to make.That small sort.Of come home. We don't want. I think you're right.I think that's I think we're on the same page. There are contractors.Thank you. Sorry that came up fast. You guys are still talking. So I want to I want to say to the residents that are here today that this item, when we talked about it ago, that it was never an intent to remove protections, remove dollar amounts, or to loosen protections again, for for renters.And so I think when these items move forward quickly, that often we it takes us all a little bit of time to make sure that we understand what we're all talking about, that we all understand what the state policy is, what it is that we have in the books on the city side.And so I'm going to ask just a couple of more clarifying questions. So the mayor just recapped the fact that the state ordinance covers more people, and that is, in fact, true. Yes.Yes.And the dollar amount of reload for the majority of people. It was a comment was made from the audience that it was only one month's rent. Can you or Patrick talk through what is a very low amount for the state and what is it that we have on the books right now for the city?And I know that that Councilmember Richardson is addressing this. I just want to make sure we ask and get clear answers.Councilwoman Mongo, the state's policy.Go for it.I'm sorry.I've never. I've never. Never. Go ahead.The state's policy offers one month's rent for relocation assistance. And so that would depend on the month, the rent that the tenant is actually paying and the unit that they're living in. So we don't know exactly what that is, but we do know what average rents are in the city.The city's relocation schedule is $2,706 for a studio apartment $3,325 for a one bedroom. Apartment $4,185 for a two bedroom apartment and 40 $500 for a three bedroom apartment. And it caps at 40 $500.And can the city attorney talk through for me the urgency of this item?Certainly. So to be clear, and I think it was clear in the staff report, but if this item, if you give direction to bring this item back next week as a repeal and an urgency ordinance, it would not immediately become effective with the intention, of course, I think by everybody is to ensure tenant protections through the endof December 31st until 1482 comes into effect. So if you do not adopt it as an urgency ordinance, then I think you're defeating one of the purposes of repealing, which is to not have two competing relocation regimes at the same time.If it's not an urgency ordinance because of the requirements of the city charter, the repeal wouldn't take effect until sometime in mid to late January. And so for that margin of time between January 1st and whenever it became effective in late January, it would be quite confusing for tenants and landlords.There would be two different relocation regimes that they would have to comply with. That is, in effect, why we're requesting urgency.One more question. The Long Beach ordinance that we had passed, we had asked for notification pieces. And I'm just wondering, are those are we intending on those staying in place or will we have to return at a later date to ensure not only notification of buildings that are being rehabbed, but also I know that staff worked fora long time on making sure we had notification that would be provided to tenants about their rights and that we had asked landlords to provide that. Would a staff see that landing right now?Well, our current ordinance still does. Still does that. But if it gets repealed, we have a lot of information on our website that could be enhanced to explain in greater detail what the state's regulation entails and includes.And I believe in terms of the rights of all that, that has already happened. So we put a lot of that information out already, I believe. So that has, you know, that that's.An ongoing process, right? I mean, you've got new people that move in. You know, we want to make sure that our landlords have that information. They're providing it to their tenants as well.And lastly, AB 1482 has notice requirements as part of.It as we had additional ones that I, I know there's a reason why we're trying to keep it simple tonight. And I know there there are a lot of things and I. It's frustrating because I know that we've had lots of conversations and for me tonight was supposed to be about following the state and then making surethat we kept in place all the things that Long Beach said we wanted to do. And so I'm trying to understand tonight for being able to make this vote and understand what next things need to happen to make sure we don't go back on our word after all the months of work that we've done.That's why I'm putting us through asking these questions. There were other notices, notifications around credit reporting around renters insurance. Those little things that I think were only really important to me. And I just wanted to know, do I need to come back with an ordinance to request some of those items?Now, as I recall. Those items that you requested. I remember you doing that were not to be part of the ordinance and they're not part of the ordinance, those that was direction that the rest of the council supported to give the staff that correct.And the information didn't.Need to be in the ordinance, but something that we will continue to do.So those were in the information sheets that were sent out and those will continue to be available. Yes.My last question is, when, Patrick, you were given the presentation, you talked about the steps that needed to happen, set out in G, one, B, which was pass the ordinance and possibly add a higher threshold that the city wanted to in a binding ordinance.In the recommendations that you guys have in front of us that says request the city attorney to prepare to repeal that it's got the senior disabled fun prepare emergency ordinance and then again disabled fund. Do we need to take a vote to do anything to make sure that the state policy is in fact adhered to in thecity? Because that's what it sounded like when you gave the presentation at the beginning.If I may, Councilman Pierce. No, I don't. I think the answer is no. The city does not need to do anything to ensure that a 1482 is effective in the city of Long Beach. I mean, it will be okay.I just from the staff presentation, I thought that there was an action that we had to take. No. And so what I want to make very clear for the residents constituents is that.Where.There is a policy on the books, that is just cause, which is something we couldn't get done on council. So there's more rights. There is tenant rela, although it is not the same amount that we had talked about.And then there is a proposal on the floor to make sure that for that small subgroup of people that are been in rehabs have enough money to get them whole as well. And so I it's a tough vote.I'm going to vote yes tonight. But I want to make it clear that there are still rights and there is still relocation and that we possibly have work to do in the future. So that that is what I just wanted to ask those questions and make sure that everybody was clear, because I know a lot of ushad conversations beforehand and there was there's no reload, there's no protections, and there are protections and we we can do more. And I think that we will do more. And so I just I want to thank all of our advocates for continuing to be brave and come out.Thank you.Thank you. Council member members, please.

Staff report, please.Jim Fisk will give this report.Larry Rich, I believe.I'm sorry, it's Larry Rich. Sustainability. Sorry, Jim.Don't have a heart attack. Good evening, honorable mayor and members of the City Council. Thank you for the opportunity to give a brief overview of the Office of Sustainability Work for 2017. In 2008, the City Council created the Sustainable City Commission to serve as an advisory body on issues related to sustainability and charged it with the developmentand implementation of a Sustainable City Action Plan. The Office of Sustainability was also created at the time to administer and support the Commission. Each year, the office works with the Commission to develop an annual work plan to provide focus to the staff work for the coming year.This year at the Commission's request, staff organize a special public input meeting to collect sustainability related community priorities for consideration. In addition, the commission and the staff held a half day work plan retreat to discuss and finalize the work plan as a result of discussions at the retreat.Commission members opted to craft their own statement of policy priorities to capture community sentiments that were not feasible to include in the work plan. As immediate action items, both the work plan and a letter from the Commission are part of your package.The workPlan itself contains three sections. The first details program management projects that will be pursued by the Office of Sustainability in partnership with other city departments or community organizations. An example of this is the forthcoming Electric Vehicle Charger Giveaway Program.The second section lists ongoing field green greenfield work activities that the office conducts to provide green services to residents and businesses such as the mulch delivery and parkway tree planting programs. Finally, the third section lists informational presentations at the office, plans to schedule for commission meetings held over the course of 2017.The letter from the Commission on Policy Priorities includes a summary of public input and a listing of high level policy recommendations based on that input. We feel that the combination of staff, work plan and commission policy priorities successfully captured the community's interest in next steps for a more sustainable city.Thank you for your consideration of these items and I stand ready to respond to any questions or comments you may have.Thank you, Councilmember Pearce.I wanted to thank our Sustainability Commission for their hard work, their diligence and their vision, and pushing our city to be as bold as we can be. And so I want to thank you also to our staff for all of your work.And I just wanted to highlight that great work. And hopefully as we move forward, we can put the steps in place we need to get to a zero waste city.Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez.Great work. I like the work plan. Just looking over it again right now, it's got great information on how we can continue being collaborative. So kudos to the commission as well as to Larry. You ran a great department and I love all of the creative ideas that have come out from this.And I know a lot of it has already been done, but still a lot of more a lot more work to do. So congratulations.Thank you. Is there any public comment on this item saying nonmembers cast your vote? There's. Okay. Come on, now. I thought I was going to get away.I'm sorry. Oh, you're not getting away. Yeah. You got opinionated community members here today, right?Go ahead and state your name. And you have 3 minutes, Gabrielle.Weeks.You've been to my house. You know where I live. I'm in the second district.Like your shirt today, Janine?I'm speaking on behalf of the Sierra Club and our 40,000 members in the area. A couple of us were able to attend this Sustainable City Commission meeting they're talking about. This is going to be great to have our city be a real leader in this area.We can you know, there's so much we can do here because we're a big enough city that we really matter, but we're not so big and unwieldy. We're like Los Angeles. I don't know how the L.A. thing done up there, but, you know, we are our mulch program.I tell my friends about this with the other Sierra Club cities and they just don't believe me. And so I've driven a number of people over to show them where.You can get it over in cities, district, by the fire station. And, you know, people, you know, we can.We have a real opportunity here to do some awesome stuff. And I hope we we dig deep and really support some some robust ideas and not just go with like the easy top two or three. So please support some some really far reaching stuff so we can really be proud of our city.Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Good evening. My name is Patricia Chen, and I'm here on behalf of Long Beach 350. We are concerned about the climate because currently there is more than much more than a safe level of 350 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.So that's where our name is. 350 We are speaking on the Sustainable City Commission Plan and policy item tonight because they contained many items that will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And two in particular that we were interested in are the transition from fossil fuels to affordable, clean energy through community choice aggregation.I think that's one of the most effective things that we could do, and it's pretty painless financially. And the other is the zero waste goal. Long Beach 350 strongly supports the Don't Waste Long Beach campaign that would reorganize the trash and recycling system in a way that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions very, very, very significantly.And the zero waste goal is a key part of the concept. And I like to say, when you throw things away, there really isn't any such thing as a way you're throwing it towards someone or something else so that don't waste.And that zero waste goal is very important to us. And we ask that you join us in supporting it. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Good evening, Vice Mayor Richardson and members of council. My name is Tony Demicco. I'm the co-director of Long Beach Fresh, the local Food Policy Council and a member of the Don't Waste Long Beach Coalition. I want to take a moment to thank Larry and his staff and our commissioners for their hard work on this wonderful work plan. And want to come before you today to encourage you to move forward with the recommendations established in the workPlan that include setting a zero waste goal. Moreover, as the city is figuring out how to roll out AB 1826 locally, I also want to urge the city to think of a comprehensive, citywide, exclusive franchise system that is, dareI say it, robust and meets high standards of recycling and composting and ensures that all Long Beach residents have access to organics collection. Now, at Long Beach Fresh, we believe that everyone in Long Beach should have access to healthy and affordable food.But meanwhile, nationwide, more than 50% of the food that we produce is actually wasted. And while we have a lot of great organizations that work on food recovery and Long Beach, like food finders, who are also part of our coalition, we think it's very important to have a good concrete plan for green beans and compost collection aswe move forward. It's also striking to me that Long Beach is the only city in the ten largest cities in the state of California that actually does not have a green bean service for his resident for their for our residents.So in setting a zero waste goal, this is a very important thing to consider as we try to get to zero waste and implement AB 1826, we must set clear goals that can keep us on course to ensure that Long Beach is a city that is nationally recognized for innovation.And as we look at compost, you know, we see it as a valuable resource to our many community gardeners and urban farmers, and also part of a larger infrastructure that's being developed within the region for large scale composting.We want to be part of that and we want to do it in a way that's not environmentally harmful, since simply composting food at the local level can save up to 86 tons of carbon emissions as opposed to landfilling that organic matter and food.So we think these are very important things to consider as we continue to innovate as a city and create new opportunities for local gardens, restaurants and residents providing healthy meals to everyone. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Good afternoon. My name is Linda Serafin. I currently sit on the board of the Element Speech Neighborhood Association, which is a member of the Don't Waste Land Beach Coalition. And I'd like to thank the Sustainability Commission for their leadership in looking at how the city of Long Beach can protect our local environment and being open to publiccomment and public input in the last few months and developing their work plan that you guys have in front of you today. So I encourage you today to adopt the recommendations made in the Sustainability Commission's work plan and move forward with creating a local zero waste goal and change our current waste system.As through my involvement in my neighborhood association, I've seen a need for a change in our current waste system. One of the complaints that I get the most is overfill trash bins. And not only does that make our streets look dirty and unappealing, but it also increases the chances of waste being washed into our storm drains andinto our oceans. And a simple solution to this would be to increase the number of recycling bins residents have access to and potentially organic compost bins in the future as well. And this can be achieved through implementing an exclusive franchise system for waste hauling with an exclusive franchise system.Our city could set specific requirements for haulers that could include guaranteed access to recycling and quality customer service for residents. This will ensure this is a mechanism that will ensure accountability in our city when it comes to setting benchmarks to exceed or reach our state school of 75% recycling by 2020.So I encourage you to be bold tonight and move forward with the Sustainability Commission's recommendations and create a local zero waste school and adopt an exclusive franchise system in order to ensure that Long Beach reaches its full potential.Thank you for your time.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Okay. Okay. Yes. I live in a landfill. I have a mobile home park that lives in a landfill. I am paying rent out there for an a landfill sick about 15 or now. So fucking excuse my angers me.I checks balance for the rent and also I couldn't take my outside on the landfill. You talk about recycling. Good. We could do it because we have to develop alternative fuels for this country, too. We have to get away from oil to the world and end.The era of the end of the era will come because no jail to control? No, the oil companies don't control geology. Gerald, who controls the oil companies? Because oil can run out. If if we do not develop alternate fuels and recycling all that and especially I live on a landfill.My home friendly village mobile home park and a peanut outrageous front for something in a landfill. Alternate fuel. I'd rather have rent control for the city and for the city alone, because if you weren't able to have like for housing, especially some of the land for getting rent control and also been recycling alternate fuels, well, get thecountry free for oil. But reality is going to do it for us. When is it going to come? A come a day that is going to come. It's going to get it's gone. It's going to come like the end of the world, being able to, you know, let go of gasoline station and say, sir, ma'am, I'll pullon the money. Well, no, no, no gasoline. I'm sorry, sir. Will be no gasoline. You'll be rioting. What will happen? It'll be rioting. I mean, rioting there. I mean, 1873, 1970s, a picnic. And now I live on a mobile friendly village, mobile home park.And we've done a PR outrageous rent. I wrote a rent control for this city. Well, it was like going away from us while we get away from oil. Well, Charles, who's going to do it for us for owning village, the prototype for alternate fuel?Question is, who could have allowed something like this people to leave for special alternate fuels to eat oil? That's like beyond me and beyond because it's the oil companies that have done this. Well, the oil companies are going to wake up the end of the world.Withdrawal is coming. But you understand the oil. You understand about your energy. You understand about geology. That's I mean, ultra fuels and in front of a control place, it's really no control. We're so out of control. You cannot believe it.It's basically something that's on alternate fuel. Give me a break. The end of the world is coming. Oil's going. Gonna run out. Wake up. Because you know what you're going to do for us. That's why we need recycling, fuel, energy efficiency and alternate fuels and geology.Because wake up. One of these days, for example, how you shouldn't be built about stuff on landfills from the village mobile home park up on. That's why I think that's living on a landfill. Pretty outrageous. Hotel rates rent control for the city of Long Beach City where it's like 600 a month.Sir. Thank you, sir. That's that's 3 minutes.Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.I appreciate your time. Thank you. Next next speaker, please.Good evening. Excuse me. Good evening, counsel. My name is Desiree Uterus, and I am proud to serve as one of the sustainable city commissioners representing District nine. I excuse me. I miss my voice. I want to thank you for reviewing the Sustainable City Action Plan that Larry and his staff have put together.And I want to acknowledge the hard work of that team. I also would like to really draw your attention to the extensive amount of public comment that our commission has been experiencing over the last several months. It wasn't just one meeting, which it may have sounded like in previous comment.We have seen a substantial increase in the public coming together representing diverse environmental issues, but coming together to make their voices heard and known. And in particular, they have drawn very strong attention, as you've heard a bit here tonight, to the establishment of a zero waste goal for the city of Long Beach.But as well as a commitment to 100% renewable energy and increased walkability and public transit. So I'd ask that in addition to moving forward, the action plan that Larry's office will execute that in your own work in developing policies for this city, that you really do take some time to consider the amount of public comment and expressionof interest that we are hearing from the public and that you really take a look at. I believe it's the fourth attachment in your packet tonight that, you know, has very extensive breakdown of what people have asked for by subject area, and also to serve as a reminder that the commission is happy to serve and support youin moving a policy forward that can advance these issues. And so please do not hesitate to call upon us so that we may support your work and support our city. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Good evening, everybody. My name is Karen Reside, and I'm here tonight on behalf of the Long Beach Gray Panthers. We're a participant in the Doe's Don't Waste Long Beach Coalition, and we're participants in the community workshops that were held by the Sustainability Commission.And I just want to commend the city staff lanreath and established an excellent job on the plan. Never seen a plan that's been so understandable in terms of what a city department is going to accomplish. And the Elliot Gonzalez also for holding a very open discussion about what the community wanted in terms of sustainability.And the Long Beach Gray Panthers are separate reporting the movement to renewable energy and the green waste collection and effective public transportation that services everybody in our community, including our seniors, have been cut off from the system. And we, going forward, will be working closely with these groups on these issues.Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.I thank you. My name's Ellie Gonzalez. I'm the current chair of the Sustainability Commission. I'll speak briefly. I think everything that. That I wanted to say was already mentioned, but I did want to just echo my fellow commissioners comment that we want to be a body which aids this council in its decision making.And one thing that didn't make it into the work plan, but was something that we were planning on reviewing, was our oil and gas operations. And I know that there is an item tonight, so I'll go ahead and wait to extend my comments until that time.But I did want to let this council know that our commission is becoming increasingly active as climate change becomes more of an accepted reality. We we're getting a lot of a lot of input from the public for a zero waste goal, for a plan to transition off of fossil fuels towards clean energy, for a plan that createsjobs, green jobs, good paying jobs. This is a vision that we have had in our in our city for well over a decade. You know, I think our current president campaigned on it. This is something that we have a lot of excitement for in our city, and it's something that I know the community wants to implement.So I did want to ask for your approval of this year's plan. And again, I'll speak to the oil and gas later when that time comes up. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Hi, my name is Spencer Sabo. I'm in fourth district. I want to talk about just a couple of issues and echoing some of the stuff that's been said, I'd like to cover those regarding trash. I live in a big apartment complex and we have less trash than recycling.However, I recycling bins are smaller than our trash. And so what happens people put their recycling is stuff in the trash. So I have to go and I'm not a manager, I'm just a concerned citizen and a citizen of planet Earth.So I would like to keep the place clean. So I go through the trash doing the the recycling pickup, so I take all the stuff and put them in there. So I think what I'm driving at is the education that we need to have for the big business and big apartment owners that we need to have flierssent to people living in a big complexes or even small apartment buildings to be educated to. What does the city vision is for the future and how can they participate? Number two, I want to talk about I think we sort of like emphasizing us citizens doing more than what the business is supposed to do.I realized was a two years ago that the city fined McDonald's for wasting water and the only business in the whole entire country got fined for wasting water. So we have a lot of waste going on in the businesses then local homes and apartment buildings.So please educate people that we can do things better to go for the zero emissions. And and that's. Thank you very much. That's it.Thank you. Our next speaker, please.Good evening, counsel. Thank you very much for having this forum or advocacy for everyone's issues. My name is Tony Taylor. I live two months every year in Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and ten months here in Long Beach.I'm a singer, songwriter, artist and investigative journalist for various magazines, The Nation Intercept magazine. And I belong to collectives or collectively see in Spanish in Argentina, indigenous groups and African-American groups and anyone in the diaspora. My point is, in Long Beach there is great artistic collectives here, and we have a beautiful gentrification, positive and negative in thein the city. And with the amount of investment that needs to be in this city, it's a beautiful thing to attract people. We have to find that fine line between those who are indigent, poor, who are being pushed out at the same time attract business.So that's always a tough, fine line. What what happened in Oakland recently with the horrible tragedy of the collective building that caught on fire? I want to put this on the record in the event we're talking about blight, okay.In the event that that tragedy, whatever happened in Long Beach, because we have a lot of artistic collectives here, make sure that no developer would like to use any tragedy for development to push people out to build condos or destroy the the collective.If that happens, make sure if we could police a consensus vote, consensus vote that you'd build another collective, have it affordable for people. That way you can increase the business. Keep the artistic community alive. Take care of people of color who are poor, poor, white people who cannot afford.And we're here to honor the indigenous rights of people and all humanity. So thank you very much for your time and to stay conscious of the issues, please.Thank you. I was I was waiting on the sustainability tie. I think you were going to speak on the next item. So seeing no more public comment members, please cast your vote.Councilwoman Pryce. Well, I'm sorry. Richardson okay. Bush and Kerry's.Thank you. So at this point, we're going to go ahead and take care of public comment. So we're going to.

Agenda item five is adopted and the chair will sign it. Will the clerk please affix my signature to the legislation on my behalf? Will the Court please read the title of item six into the record and the item six Resolution 32027.A resolution modifying the Mayoral Civil Emergency Order of October 29th, 2021, related to hiring incentives for public safety. Emergency Response. The committee recommends the City Council adopt, as amended, the resolution with councilmembers Herbold, Gonzalez, Lewis and Morales and favor councilmembers Macheda and Serrano opposed and councilmembers Suarez, Peterson and Strauss abstaining.Thank you, madam. Are there any comments on resolution 32027? Agenda item six. Councilmember Herbold, please.Thank you so much. As a clerk, this was approved in the Budget Committee by a42 vote with three abstentions. The CBA and the resolution are intended to amend the mayor's emergency order on hiring incentives to first limit the duration of the emergency order through the end of 2021.And secondly, to limit expenditures pursuant to the order $500,000 in 2021 is the amount his office estimated would meet it in 2021. The resolution works in conjunction with a budget action in the chairman's balancing package, which requests a report from the City Budget Office to the Council on a potential citywide hiring incentive for frontline workers beyond thosecovered in the mayor's current emergency order. Extending those incentives to to recruits, to departments beyond speed and the Community Safety Communication Center. Item Leaves in place Mayor's Executive Order regarding hiring bonuses for police officer in line areas through the end of 2021.Some of you may recall that there is another proposal not on the agenda today to limit the hiring incentives to only see us seek recruits and not permit the incentives or our recruit. If the vote in favor of action eight does not prevail, we will very likely see the other proposal before us at our next meeting, andthat this proposal is related to an executive order promulgated by Mayor Durkan. I believe it's appropriate the executive order and end of her term regardless which action amending mayor and executive order ls. Incoming elect incoming mayor elect Harrell could issue a new executive order in 2022.Support important work of all of our city departments and I recognize the difficulty we are having filling vacancies in this labor market and the impact on the delivery of supply of public services and the impact on morale in each of these departments.And for that reason, I, for one, would strongly prefer of a 2022 fixation, which means indeed, we could add bonus incentives for rather than having a new conversation both this year and again next year, about excluding SPV officer recruits.Finally, as a reminder, the balancing package before us. There is no funding for bonuses in 2022 as a quently then those funds are not in the 2022 budget. It's more important than ever that if we're going to have a bonus program in 2022, we have deliberations about how to fund it before authorizing it.Thank you.He becomes member. Councilmember Peterson, please.Thank you. Council President. I thank you, Councilmember Herbold, for that. I support Mayor Durkin's executive order for hiring incentives, and it seems to have achieved some early success. I believe these hiring incentives are needed after the alarming spike in the number of police officers in 911 dispatchers leaving their positions.At the same time, I agree that today's suggested modifications of the executive order from our public safety chair are reasonable and fiscally prudent as they allow the hiring incentives to continue to the end of this year. And while the Council unfortunately did not approve hiring incentives as part of our fall budget process for next year 2022, today'saction still leaves the door open for the incoming administration to reissue a similar executive order if needed, as Seattle competes with other jurisdictions across the nation for emergency response personnel. I would encourage the incoming administration in January to do what it can and not only to hire police officers and firefighters and 9 million dispatchers, but also toretain these valuable employees that we already have. So they continue to serve Seattle. So I will be voting for these modifications. Thank you.I think it comes from Peterson, who has more than one.Thank you. On October 29th, Mayor Durkan issued an emergency order to reinstate hiring bonuses of up to $25,000 for new police officers. Ironically, her excuse for this emergency order was to give police even more money because of the COVID 19 emergency.In other words, even though so many police officers are actually endangering the public by refusing to be vaccinated or to wear masks, they still apparently need to be given more money. Mayor Durkan has shown a shocking double standard when she advocated for hiring bonuses in the Seattle Police Department.The police are some of the highest paid city of Seattle employees, making more than double what is paid to social workers like homeless service workers. The mayor has claimed in the past that she could not that she could she could not open homeless shelters and tiny house villages because there are not enough homeless service workers to staffnew spaces. Where are the hiring bonuses then, or just decent living standards for impoverished homeless service workers who actually help people turn their lives around? Most importantly, the size of the police budget is not what has a statistical impact on the amount of crime in a community, and that includes police officer salaries as well, not having astatistical impact on public safety. I apologize for my dog. It is reducing inequality and providing affordable housing and living wage jobs and affordable services, including childcare, but has a greater statistical impact. I absolutely share the concerns that working people have about the rise in gun violence.There is no question that we do need to address this. But if you look at the data, you will see that this is happening. Even though the police budget has been bloated for many years, while the social services and affordable housing that working people, oppressed communities and the poor need continue to be gravely underfunded and at thesame time, rents by corporate landlords are skyrocketing. Studies show overwhelmingly the best and really only solution to public safety issues is to fund the needs of our society to address crime, and particularly to stop crimes before they even happen.We need to find affordable housing, social housing that is publicly owned, high quality, affordable housing funded by taxing big businesses and the wealthy. We need to raise wages and and exploitation, not increase repression. We need an elected community oversight committee with full powers over the police.On November eight, my office introduced legislation to modify the mayor's executive order, which would stop the implementation of the police hiring bonuses that the council voted on Loder in September against implementing twice by legislation left in place the hiring bonuses for 911 operators.However, rather than bringing that legislation to a vote, it was delayed by two weeks to give the political establishment the opportunity to bring alternative legislation through the Budget Committee that essentially approves the mayor's executive order, which is the bill in front of us today.I'm confused how this bill, which does not amend one word or a number in the budget, was treated as budget legislation. But regardless, it is the bill in front of us today. This bill approves Durkan the executive order on hiring bonuses for the duration of her term.In my view, those hiring bonuses are a terrible misuse of city resources that should be used for affordable housing, social services and for the needs of our communities. So I will be voting no on this resolution if the majority of the Council agrees with me and votes no on this emergency order.I hope the Council will consider to schedule a will. Agree to schedule the resolution from my office rejecting the mayor's emergency order for a vote next Monday.Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember. Silent. Are there any additional comments on item six, which is resolution 32027? Councilmember, will you have the last word.On the points for the viewing public? I just want to advise that the mayor's office has confirmed that funding is available throughout during 2021 to implement the executive order. I have requested an update from the Mayor's Office on the implementation of the vaccine mandate as it pertains to police officers and 911 dispatchers.I'm confused as to. Councilmember still wants reference of the vaccine mandate and the fact that officers haven't complied as a reason for why a hiring incentive for departments that who for whom their management is enforcing the vaccine mandate event.I mean I think that is what is partially creating the need for hiring incentives is to support the officers in one case and the one dispatchers in the other case who have complied and who are are still with the city, still performing public service and are working in departments that have large vacancies.So I really see the the allowance of of hiring incentives through the end of this year as really being part and parcel of supporting the enforcement of the vaccine mandate.Thank you. Thank you so much, Councilmember Herbold. Okay. With that debate is now closed on this particular agenda item. So will the clerk please call the role on the adoption of resolution 32027?

I'm Ninette Mchunu in the hire. Thank you for. Good evening, mayor and council members. I'm Ninette Mchunu in the community development and based we use departments. What you have in front of you today is a five year lease for Building 1701 mana of Building 29, located at 1701 Monarch Street.This is an existing tenant who's been in the building since 2009. Currently, there are about 15 employees in the building. There are ten existing sub tenants. The building is used. It's one of our last remaining multi tenanted shop office spaces buildings at Alameda Point.We are in the process. As you know, you've recently approved two large buildings that will be multi tenanted, but those are for the food and beverage industries. And so this is one of the. We also have navigator systems, which has art spaces and other kind of some craftsmen.But this is this building specific to metalworkers and artisans and that and that. Medium. So at our last council meeting, when you approve or the last council meeting, I was that you approved a lease for Google. And many members of the community kind of said that you guys were only interested in those high tech, high educated jobs. And this this tenant provides skilled workers, the steel metal craftsmen, artisans. And so it is consistent with trying to develop a diverse workforce in Alameda. And we believe that the five year term is consistent with the development plans at Alameda Point.And I hope that you will consider approving this lease tonight. The the tenant is here. And if you had questions directly of him, he's open to answering your questions.And we do have public speakers. Okay.Oh, this is excellent.Yeah.The.All right. So I'm going to go ahead in any clarifying questions right now, but I'm going to go ahead and call the public speakers. Tim looks like L.A. I asked Tycho and then Wolfgang Brink and then Peter Dreyfuss.You can go ahead and line up and come on up and speak for 3 minutes. You can have up to 3 minutes.The.I'm in order.Good evening, Adam. Mayor Spencer and esteemed council members. My name is Tim. Likes to go and I'm a my day job. I'm a construction manager for the Oakland Housing Authority. I have a small workspace shop at building B29.I'm here for the sole purpose of. Of supporting Peter Dreyfus. And and your in proving his five year lease. Emma Griffiths helped partners with Peter Dreyfus supports small artisans. Craftsman. Metal workers and doing their work. That's something that doesn't go on.I have a shop out there just to keep me sane. As I said, I am a professional construction manager for Oakland Housing Authority. As my day job and I go out there in the evenings and weekends and practice woodwork and other metalworking machinery restoration.You know. I can say a lot and I won't. But again, Peter Dreyfus, I don't think anybody out there is getting rich, but they do provide a lot of resources for the community and artists and and artwork and craftsman style work and ask.Another thing I want to point out, Dreyfus Capital Partners provide provides for a reasonable and affordable rent. And I think if you look at the facts, you'll see why he should be given a five year lease. Thanks.Thank you. Wolfgang Brink.Hmm. Good evening, Mayor and city council members. My name is Wolfgang Brink. I'm a tenant building 29, and I've been Alameda resident for. 16 years and I've been out at the point. With Peter Dreyfus for the last ten years and we've.Been sort of hopscotching around.Because, you know, the clean up and things were going on. With me. We started out on one end of the seaplane lagoon, and we came to the other side and. Having having to move is very disruptive. I remember the last big move we had.We had huge machinery lathes and all kinds of stuff. And for for a small business person that's very expensive and disruptive. You know, if you make a move, if you don't do anything for two months. So set up again.So having a five year lease. You know, it's very critical to us that, you know, and and as Tim said. Lot of our small. Artists and artisans and craftspeople and. Small businesses operate on pretty narrow margins and having reasonable rents which rivals.Company provides us with is very critical to us and. And if. We have to move in two years or you know, it's it's there aren't a whole lot of places to go. And we have a. Wonderful community out there.And I think we do make a contribution even though we're a small group.Yes. Yeah. Just so what do you do? What I'm involved in.I'm a I'm a builder and. Of traditional Arctic kayaks. And I also teach kayak building. And one of the reasons one of the things that attracted me to the location out there is the proximity to water. So. And I've gone up to Alaska to teach kayak building at native culture camps.So yeah. So I just appreciate the opportunity to be out there. In this beautiful environment.Thank you.Hope you approve.Thank you very much. Our next speaker, Peter Dreyfus. Now, did you. You could wait and be the last speaker you could go. Now it's up to you. And we may very well be calling you back later. All right.Go ahead.Madame Mayor. Council people. Wolfgang Brink is just way too modest. If you Google him, you'll find 86 pages. World famous man who wrote the book on Illusion Native Arts. Thanks for this hearing. I signed a lease for a five year renewal out there at Building 29 about two and a half months ago.And I.Thought I would show up tonight.And just see a rather pro-forma signature by the city attorney. But as it turned out, about 28 hours ago, I got a letter. From The Net saying that the Sierra Club was a little bothered by our continued presence there for longer than two years.Now I could go on and on and tell you how great the building is and what we all do there. I personally am a steel sculptor. If you come out and I invite you all out there, you'll see my sculptures out in the sculpture garden, etc., etc..But most of the guys there actually make a living doing high tech, very precise cad cam engineered machining work. And in the letter that I distributed, you'll find a list of the clients who go from MoMA to the new Giant Stadium in Santa Clara to Clorox, etc., etc..I'm sorry.I'm sorry.If you still haven't.Visited. Oh, terrible. So I just want to rebut the letter that the Sierra Club issued, and I assume you all have a copy of it. It makes an argument that the Raptors. Our crouched on our roof and gobbling up the valuable birds.But if you follow that line of reasoning. Because of our location next to the wetlands. We must then demolish all the buildings on monarch that face that way. And that's not going to happen. My biggest regret is that the early master planners of the future development out here, the redevelopment of the point.Just erased our building. We can't redraw our self into the map. Unfortunately. I accept that. But I would beg your indulgence for five, seven, ten more years. And why? This is a unique building that the Navy left. It costs 18 or $19 million.It is a deluxe facility with. A lot of beeps and overhead cranes. And it's a it's a wonderful machining building. And a few of my colleagues will tell you a bit more.Thank you for your probably have speakers for you and you know so if you could hang around. We will be asking you. Thank you. Questions of thanks. All right. Andrea, Joe Hansen and then Thomas Bianco and then John Bouchet.Hello. My name is Andrew Johansen and I represent a business that is in Building 29. It's called Alameda.Of Wooden Trailers.What we do is we create small recreational vehicles.They're actually teardrop trailers in that traditional woody sense, and they are small enough and light enough to be towed behind a motorcycle. I'm an Alameda resident. My kids are here earlier, but.Unfortunately, bedtime hit. My father is, uh, Thomas Bianco. Merlin. He's the other half of the business.I'm the business side. He's the engineering side. And we love Building 29. It's been a wonderful opportunity to meet other artisans to hand our steel off to another part for specialty work, to look at the techniques that other woodworkers are doing.And it's been a wonderful environment. So I just would encourage you to do let us keep that amazing collaborative environment. Thank you.Mr. Bianco.Council members. I'm Thomas Bianco. I am the other half of element of wooden trailers. Peter Dreyfus. And I bumped into because somebody said the only thing we might have would be 5000 square feet of shop space. And we don't have any of that.We need 40,000. No, we build a trailer that will literally fit on top of that table. I'm building three of them right now in about 400 square feet. The ability for Peter to say, You know what, I like where you're going.And this looked like fun to me. We found a real home in 29 in the community. It's out there. Peter Dreyfus made it very easy for us to do what we hoped to do. If we're going to do this, we do it in Alameda, we create a business in Alameda.We go by all of the rules, all the numbers. I've been aerospace, manufacturing and engineering for 40 years. I have worked on or engineered. Just about everything you can think of somebody uses in a military. This is what I'm having a really fun time doing.I came off of a five year, five and a half year road trip. I had retired and we decided to do this here because we both love Alameda. I don't know if I'd have done it anywhere else if we had to go off island, because when we expand, we would hope to expand it.Not a whole lot. We don't want to be a major. We build a very custom product. We are artisans. I never thought of myself as that before, but I've got a particular way I want to do it and I sell a product.We try to sell a product that's the best we can because that's what we're proud of and that's one of the things we hope to continue. And when I start to bring in artisans to finish that work because I want to go play on the road, they're going to be in and out of this community, not justbuilding 29, but the island. Thank you very much.Thank you. Joan Bouchet, Kris here and I son. And then Sean Cronin.Hello.Hello. Good evening, Mayor Spencer.City Council Member. City Staff. I'm John Boucher. You met my.Husband earlier, Wolfgang, and I love going to building 29 because there's a rich craftsman culture there.And people who have.A reason to visit there.Experience something wonderful and rare in our Urban Bay Area 2016 world. They get to be with the makers. They get to hang out with the people who are proud of what they're making.Potentially for the.Visitor. Hmm. Our building. 29 craftsmen like their neighbors in.Spirit Alley.Offers something meaningful to our Alameda community culturally and economically. And as someone who supports slow and well.Contemplated growth for Alameda. I am here to request that unless you have.A specific plan in progress.For developing that site. Please don't hasten to close down Building 29. If the question tonight is whether.To give them two or five years more. Make it five. Thank you.Chris.In the evening. Mayor Council members. My name is Christian Eisen and I have a company called Vector Pickle and I'm one of the tenants of Building 29. I am I don't consider myself an artist, but I am a craftsman and a manufacturer.I've been involved with industrial design and building things for pretty much all my life, and I run a business that out of Building 29 that is my livelihood and also employs other people, mostly on a part time basis at this time.But as as I need them. My clients include many names that you guys have heard, both locally and nationally, from Artemus Racing to Facebook to Old Navy. A lot of large and small customers and also a lot of local designers that are doing cutting edge work in furniture design and product design.My location in our building allows me kind of a unique perspective on the nature that goes around behind Building 29, which the Sierra Club is referring to. It has allowed me to observe the abundant and ever growing amount of wildlife out there.And I'm I've never ceased to be and may be amazed by how many animals are out there. We have geese, pelicans, hawks, even owls I've been startled by at night out there. Just the other day there were 20 herons standing next to the pond behind our building.Also out there are squirrels, rabbits, raccoons, occasional house cat, even some stray dogs. And they all seem to be thriving very well. There are raptors out there which the Sierra Club has referenced, and they do do what raptors do.And because of all the wildlife out there, that's why they're there. They they do go after most of the things they see them go after are the rabbits and the squirrels occasionally pigeons. I have not seen them do too many of the other birds, but it does happen, I'm sure, and that's kind of the natural way ofthings. Removing our building is not going to remove that. This is what this is what wildlife is. It's a natural occurrence. These birds nest our perch on our building. They perch on building 25, which is just down from us on the control tower, rock wall winery all down the row.It's it's a virtual smorgasbord for them out there. I mean, I hate to be blunt about it, but and removing our building is not going to change that. And I almost think that, you know, it's it's something that would allow people in Alameda to observe natural things going on.But I also want to say that this is not just a building full of people exploring their lives and doing pursuing their hobbies. This is viable businesses that employ people, that manufacture things for for companies in the Bay Area and beyond that desire our products.And I would urge you guys to please approve the five year lease and and let us stay there at least that long, if not longer.Thank you. Thank you, Sean. And then Irene Deeter and then Richard Baer. And then there are final speakers on this item. If you would like to speak on this, please submit your slip.Good evening. Their council members. Thank you very much. You pronounce my name wonderfully, Sean Cronin. I am a tenant of Building 29, part of the community. It's it's been a pleasure being out there. I moved in five years ago when we when they moved over from the other space after being relocated.I had recently graduated from the California College of the Arts, sculpture and furniture major, destined to be a full time artist. That's my dream. And I've I have sacrificed a lot to do that as my my community, my friends, my fellow tenants.The building is my my livelihood. That space, that studio space, I make my living out of that space. The point they made earlier, Wolfgang made about relocating. Sounds easy for a big business. It's almost a killer for a small business if you're not prepared for it.Moving at this point, moving two years from now even is daunting. Five years is even scary, frankly. And we've moved into this space knowing that the the the redevelopment plan was in action. And I'm excited to see what's happening and the changes that have already been made.But knowing that my time in Alameda might come to an end, because that's kind of the first thing to go in a big redeveloped redevelopment plan. When I heard the news that that Google was renting the big space right over from us, I was equally as excited as I was concerned that all of a sudden these bigcompanies are coming in and that my MySpace. The days were numbered. So seeing this letter yesterday was a was a surprise. Recently, I've just reconfigured my studio space, which is a small part in the front of the building to have a a clean area, a space where I can actually have regular open studios, as I've had anumber of over the years. I'm now encouraging more people to come and see my space and see my practice and the fact that the fact that now, you know, I'm nearly done. I'm nearly going to paint the walls white.And we are looking at a termination or an early termination of this lease. It's just it's just scary. So I invite you all out to see my work, to see what we do in the space and see the community that's out there.That, again, the low rent that Peter's provided in the space has really kept me in the Bay Area, frankly. West Oakland, there's still some spots here and there were small scale artists is the starving artist. I hate to say that, but that's that's what I'm doing.You know, I know a few that can survive right now in West Oakland, but it's happening over the Bay Area that artists are getting pushed out as as as what happens. So. I just encourage you guys to. Extend our time there.Five years, as Peter said, seven years. Ten years. I mean, really, I think the. Thank you very much.Thank you.Hello, Mayor and City Council. My name is Irene Dieter, and I'm here tonight to speak on behalf of the Sierra Club. We've sent you a letter which obviously the audience is aware of, too, which asks for us to shorten the term of the lease, to work with the tenant to find another location, and to set aside leaserevenues from the building for demolition. And why did we ask for this? It's so that we're not here five years from now going through this exact same exercise. It's one thing for Dave Park to be on a planning map.It's another thing to follow that up with some action to actually make it happen. These tenants will eventually have to move if the city is serious about creating a wetland park there. So taking action tonight in some capacity to send a message to the environmental community that you are serious.It will. It will also show movement in that direction, and it will show funding agencies that Alameda is indeed ready to move forward with getting some grant funding. The timeframe of two years is not carved in stone. It was something that the Sierra Club did talk about very closely.We actually had the tenants in mind. We did it out of support to them because we felt that we wanted to give them first dibs on any available buildings out at Alameda Point before they're leased to somebody else.And we did not want them to be displaced should funding transpire in the meantime? Because I know that the lease, you can pull it at any time within five years. I think that's what it says in the least, that it's can be retractable at any time.And I was assuming that was because of in case funding is available for the to create the park. So we certainly wouldn't want to displace the tenants in a hurry and we definitely do not want to lose these tenants from Alameda Point.So the timeframe that we came up with was strictly in support of the tenants. And we it's unfortunate that it has come out that the Sierra Club is put in an animosity position because that was not our intention at all.It was to be supportive. So that counts if the council has another idea to make the deep Dave Park plans solidified tonight that coincides with this lease. We are of course, open to hear something else. But. But. To continue the status quo without any action tonight will just show that nothing is going to change on the ground. So we encourage you to do something tonight to show that you support De Pave Park. Thank you.Thank you. And Richard Banger. And he's our last speaker.I just have a clarifying question was, um, we're not considering Dave Park tonight. Correct. Okay. Just the lease for building 29. Thank you.Thank you, Mayor. Members of the council and city staff. This area on the west side of the seaplane lagoon. Currently there's a what I would call a conflict of interests. We have an approved plan, but we also have existing tenants.And. I want these tenants to stay at Alameda Point. Small businesses like like theirs. They need help. They need help more than Google does. Google Mcconney. Is gambling with stockholders money that they may have something to sell. The artisans at Building 29 are actually producing products.If people buy their viable business, they're not speculating that they might sell something. So I want them to stay. But the conflict here is that. The plan that was approved in 2014 for the waterfront at Alameda Point. That wasn't.Created by the Sierra Club or by any other single individual or group. It was created by a consultant that the city hired and paid a quarter of $1,000,000 to. So the plan was approved. Building 29 was not part of the long range plan.Now, I sympathize with with the the tenants and the landlord. It's not fun to move. But this, whether it's lease is two years, three years, four years or five years. It doesn't guarantee that they're going to be there five years from now, four years from now or three years from now.Because, number one, there's a clause in the lease that says either party can cancel the lease without cause. Running in tandem with that is if the city is successful in getting grant money to build the park. The approved plans say that the buildings can be torn down when funding is available for the park.So this lease will you if you approve, two years, three years, four years or five years? It's not guaranteeing that these businesses are going to be here in three, four or five years. In fact, if you don't start looking now, five years from now, they may be moving to Oakland, Hayward or Union City or who knows where. So you can't package all this into this lease. But I think it is a good time right now to start thinking about how are you going to make a positive step to start implementing Deep Park? And some people may say, well, just.Focusing on this one building. You're doing it piecemeal. Well, that hasn't stopped us from starting piecemeal with the sports complex. We're not going to wait till we have another $15 million to start sports complex. You know, there's $5 million coming from the developer side, and we're going to start that very soon.So we can take a small step here. And I hope you would figure out something that would get us on that path. Thank you.Thank you very much. All right. So he's our last speaker on this item, council members and vice mayor.I think the.Two things that I want out out of this is one as I want the businesses to stay in Alameda point. And two is I want the park. And the park is in. The plan is a plan that was approved by this city after numerous public hearings and council approval.And it doesn't include Building 29. So one of the things that I'd like this council to consider is and I think the five year leases is appropriate for what might have to be done to accomplish both of these goals.When I was looking at the revenues that this lease would generate. It's about $250,000, give or take, over those five years of the cost of demolishing. Building 29 is about $300,000, give or take. And that's a key step in getting grants and paving paving the way for the park, the park opening the opening the process up toestablish the park. That being said, I don't want to lose these businesses or this community from Alameda Point and there are other buildings at Alameda Point that could take this, but it's not an insignificant effort to move an operation like this.And that won't happen two years. So I think two years is an unrealistic time timeline. I think the five year lease gives us time to do a comp to do take steps to accomplish both of those goals. So I'm asking staff, oh, what would be the appropriate vehicles to to accomplish both of those goals with the goalnumber one, of moving the community to another location? Number two is removing Building 29. Setting the stage for expanding the wetlands and working on that southwest section of of this Pave Park.Can I just ask a question that follows along with that? We've been talking a lot about or hearing a lot about Dave Park, and as I understand from Ms. Wooldridge, who is both interim assistant city manager, but also the director of Recreation Parks.That's a park that is under her department's jurisdiction. Could we just hear a little bit from her about the funding and just to enlighten all of us in making her decision.A good that.Until you hear the.Answer, I think it's appropriate to let the vice me.Go. Okay. I think it's all related, but sure.But I would like to take this in steps. And one of the things that I'd like to to understand is because one of the thoughts that occurred to me is, is the lease revenues that come from this building and be set aside for the demolition of the building.So I'd like to focus first on Mike Tyson shares comments. I think it's important to let the.Yes. Okay. So two questions. One, about relocation of existing tenants. And I'm going to refer that question to Ms.. Marcano about what is available out there. And I'm sure she's been thinking about this, the removal of Building 29 and the proceeds.I would like to speak to that. I'll let her talk first. But I think it is related to vice mayor or excuse me, Councilmember Ashcraft question about other things we have in our list of priorities on parks. But I'll reserve that until Mr. McConnell is done.And I really want us to focus on the vice mayor's comments. Questions first. We can take them in order. Thank you.Good evening, Annette Mchunu from the Community Development Based Fees Department. So relocating the existing tenants, that's always a priority for staff because it's the best economic strategy is to retain businesses versus going to try to recruit new businesses.I'm. They're currently in our stock. There probably isn't a building that would meet the this this use. However, we are negotiating with a tenant a a developer who does exactly what these leases creates these creative spaces. It's not a food and beverage focus.And so there might be opportunity to do some sort of transition from building 29 to this new tenant if that lease is approved by the council. That would be the only thing that could potentially, I think, meet the needs.I mean, the thing that most people think about allow me to point is that, oh, we got all those buildings. But we are actually in the process of moving people out of buildings to make way for development. So.So our our stock is shrinking. And also these these tenants need they have a specialized need with overhead cranes and and also the ability to locate these uses next to each other. The requirement of the structure has to be just right.So because building 29 is this big concrete thing, it works for them. And so it is a priority for us to think about trying to relocate these tenants. Vice Mayor. And it is something that we will we will continue to make a priority and.There's some other things that we're trying to do to create more spaces at Alameda Point, more creative spaces, but I don't know quite the horizon for that. It's not it's not next year. It might be in the next five years.Vice Mayor, did you have.No, I think Ms.. McConnell's last comment about the five year time frame. Is is two years is not enough to accomplish what? It would take to meet that goal. It would take something more perhaps in the next five years.Thank you.Okay. And then you had questions for.Right. So the second question, which is about removing Building 29 and and taking the proceeds over over the five year period to demolish Building 29. So I'm sure those proceeds are spoken for and I'm looking at Miss Ott.But I think the larger question is really for us on staff, and I think this is where Ms. Wooldridge can chime in here, which is we have some already some significant priorities in the area of parks and just to name a few, Jean Sweeney Cruise Park, which has been on the drawing board for a very long time. We have estuary park, we have internal boat ramp. Those are all things that are already have we've already been directed to make sure those things are happening. Adding on to that now is Deep Park. Now does it mean that we are not permitted to be D Pave Park?But there's only so much that we can do in the time that we have and with our limited resources. So I'm just putting that out there to this council. So you recognize we have a very serious plight not only to construct parks, but then to maintain them there.Yes, and I understand that. And I think the horizon for executing D Pave Park in the Wetlands is a long one and we have to take steps to it. And I don't want to I would rather apply the logic that we did when we.I spent $1,000,000 to buy the Beltline and invest the million plus in the legal costs to get us in the position to buy that. Even though we were strapped then because having 22 acres of park in the middle of the city was worth it and it's a long horizon.We're also it's not a question of whether staff is committed or this council's committed. Our plan commits us to this park. And unless this council or a future council changes that plan, we're committed. So I'd like to get the ball rolling and.Make sure that we've got real milestones that that put us along the path to get us to the park and the time that it will take to provide the time that it will be needed to provide money to maintain the park.It's quite a ways out. But unless we start putting the pieces together, just like the acquisition of the Beltline property that sets up Jane Sweeney Park, the act was the execution of this plan depends on that building going away.So what I would recommend, because we're talking money and money does come into your conversation soon because we're going to be doing, starting in March, our mid-cycle review for our next fiscal year, $250,000 is a significant amount of money.And so I think what we can do is I can ask Ms.. Ott and Ms.. Marcano to take a look at that. But I mean, that means that now that money is not going into the base reuse department.And so there are other things that will have to come off the table. So that's something that this council has to decide if that's a priority, and we can bring it back at that time. All right.Any other council members member. Did you want to speak now?I'm just not sure if we're ready to have that discussion today as part of the lease. I mean, I think I'm happy we should consider the lease, you know, on its own, within the four corners of the lease, and then kind of defer that that discussion to another time without making any commitment.I mean. The exact number is 258 to 4708. Just because I did add it up. Tony sorry to do it, if that's okay. But, you know, I see nothing that I've heard today that would make me want to vote against this lease.I mean, I think these are the type of jobs that we want to not only create in Alameda with our maker spaces and our incubator spaces, but these are the jobs we want to keep in Alameda. And I haven't I have yet to hear a plan.Mr. McConnell. You said we don't have a space for for these businesses now. So I mean. I'm perfectly happy with going with the five year lease and ready to vote to approve it.Member de.SAC. Thank you. The question before us tonight is whether to move forward with the lease or not, whether to move forward it as is or or not. And in a modified or in a modified fashion, I think the answer to that question stands on its own.I think this is a valuable project. I think the type of activity that's there is the type of activity that not just here in Alameda Point, but in the United States that we want to encourage in order to encourage small, artisanal craft manufacturing.You need to build the appropriate space for for such activities. It's very difficult. And fortunately, at Building 29, a number of like minded entrepreneurs found a place where they can work with each other and as indicated by the homemaker, you know, work with nature as well.So I think for me, the answer to the question is that we should move forward. I would encourage vice mayor, Battery City or I don't know if you or council member Ashcraft, if they're so interested on a parallel track separate from this, to move forward with some kind of council community referral as to how to begin toimplement the DE Pave Park. But at least, you know, we would have started this. So. I'm ready to move forward.Remember Ashcroft?Thank you, Mayor Spencer. Thank you for all the speakers. Whenever I'm out and about and this week, I've had an opportunity to visit some other job sites in our city and the main island. Not at all made a point, but it was really intriguing hearing from all of you.And I am going to Google you, Mr. Brink, but the we have a lot of talent here in Alameda. And I do think that added Alameda point, we have a rather unique situation when you just think of all the creativity that's going on from the high tech to the Spirit Valley and the food and beverage purveyors andthese artisans and craftspeople. And we I know a number of us on the council are concerned about the loss of jobs in the face of development. This is a little bit different because, yes, this is the future site of a park, but I don't see the D paved park plan and a five year lease for Building 29is mutually exclusive propositions. I spent a little time talking with Jeannot this week is the zero added Alameda point and and I also talked from to Ms. Wooldridge from time to time. We, we definitely have this park and many others on the horizon.It's another conversation for this council to make if we're going to take away money from the parts that are already in the queue. But Ms. Wooldridge is also quite a genius at getting us grant funding and perhaps the Sierra Club can be out there beating the bushes too.I don't know what all the opportunities are for funding, but the point is that the work will most likely be done in phases when it comes to doing the park and there's nothing that says the first phases can't take place farthest out from the building.And so at this point in time, I, I prefer to follow the recommendations of our staff. They're out there on a daily basis. They know the situation. And yes, our lease revenues are spoken for. If we decide to defer divert them for some years, that's a council decision, just not before us tonight.But at this point in time, I could not support eliminating jobs and lease revenue. And again, these are unique uses that are have found their their way to Alameda point it's it's recycling it's free use of existing buildings and so I'm going to support this ordinance in the five year term.And then I just want to add a little footnote. This is directed to you, Ms.. And Ms.. Mercado. You know, you've done a couple of really cool tours out to Alameda Point. We did a bicycle tour one time and we did a walking tour maybe a year ago.So maybe the next time we do a tour, if we could. And if you all would be willing, it sounds like you'd be willing to open your doors and have the public come in, because I don't want you to be the best kept secret in town.I think not only our local residents, I think folks in the in the surrounding Bay Area would be very interested to see see what you're doing out there and maybe become your customers. So that's that's my ask. Thank you.But I'm prepared to support this.So when you look at Deep Park, I have a question. So I think it was last council meeting, we had the speaker come and say that I think this is the area where they want to drive back. This is the area where you cut through the.Was it here it is right here. Okay. So this so personally, I would like us to try to take steps. While the building is there to make this area more accessible to the public.We're in the process of removing the pedestrian gate to allow cars to go through.Okay. So I think that's a big step. So I appreciate that. And then we'll be able to take pictures to that because that was another complaint that we've heard periodically.Currently, people can walk through there and this was the area that we put the fencing in to try to prevent vandalism, car shows, things like that. But we hear the public and we hear from you. We want to make it more accessible.So we are going to to make it car accessible.Okay. So I appreciate that. And that's important to me and I think it's important to our public. And so stop thinking that we have to demolish this building in order for the public to have access to this area.Is is not true. We are working on giving this area more accessibility, you know, giving the public more accessibility to this area. And I think that is a big step in regards to this building. I've never been inside this building.I appreciate Member Ashcroft's idea. Maybe it could be like an open house or something. I don't even know that the city has to be involved in it, but I know that I've been there are open, you know, open studios throughout town, different artists have.So maybe it's more like just like an open studio or something like that. That doesn't necessarily have to involve staff in regards to staff's plan of our steps moving forward with this park. I think that that's. Separate issue, and I don't know when that will circle back.But I do know that and I that we have many other parks, that we have a lot of work to do, significant work and. This is just one of them. So I think maybe it would be appropriate at some point to show us what the plan is.But there really is a plan. And not only is it limited money, it's also limited staff time. And we really do want the parks to be done well. And so I don't think you can doing all of them at once, as much as we'd like to have that done.But that doesn't mean that we won't get to this just like it doesn't mean that we're never going to get to cruise the park even then, I think, which is where I live near. We've been waiting since my kids were little and now they're, you know, in their twenties.So sometimes it takes a while to get to these parks. It doesn't mean that we're giving up on our parks. It just means that for us in this manner, you know, we have so much staff and so much money.So I do plan to support this and I appreciate trying to open up this area so that the public can have access in the meantime. And I'm confident that this doesn't that moving forward with this lease doesn't mean that we're not committed as a city to Deep Pave Park.And I am concerned about trying to find new space or these tenants. I think it's very important, as you've heard from other council members and I'm sure you'll hear from our community, we like having these craftsmen here. And so that to me has to be part of moving, trying, trying our hardest as a staff to accommodate themsomewhere so that we don't lose that part of who Alameda is. But I do think that's real important. So I appreciate staff's effort, too, and trying to help them figure out how to relocate. And then I think it I think that they can stay there until we need them to move.I don't think we need to demolish the building way ahead to being able to do anything else. And I think we can. Get access and improve access while the building is there operating supporting our craftspeople. Yes.So a question to staff, maybe the city attorneys. How do we get that? That sentiment, the sentiment that that building is not going to be there forever. And at some point people are going to have to leave people who we want to have at Alameda Point.How do we get that high on the priority list so that there's a report back so that there's progress toward that goal? We have a five year window with this lease. So I personally am asking the question if we have this five year window with this lease.How do we.And I and from Mitch McConnell said it's going to take five plus years. How do we get that so that it's it's not just something that slips to the bottom of the pile, but is something that we actually accomplish as a goal.I think you do counsel referral because at this point I'm not.Asking the staff.To give direction.Yeah, I'm sorry. Would that be in the form of a council referral? But because I don't think you really I don't think there's necessarily three councilmembers that want to prioritize demolishing the building ahead of being able to help it with the paperwork.It doesn't sound like that's what the vice mayor is suggesting. I think he's just suggesting he wants to make sure that the tenant he just wants to make sure that the tenants recognize that at some point, you know, we won't be renewing their lease.Is that.That's correct.Right. I think that's just want to moralize that.But I think that's already in the plan. No, I don't know.Let me just.A comment was made about being able to terminate the lease. There is a provision in the lease that either party on 12 months notice can terminate the lease. But so that I understand. But I think the point is that they have heard you.They've clearly heard you. They're all here nervous and telling you how nervous they are. So I think the tenants understand you've heard this Mchunu tell you how she's working with trying to come up with a plan on where to move these people.So my recommendation would be not to try to do anything different to the lease, but go forward in approvals and that you will hear back from staff. And I think what the city manager was suggesting is we don't necessarily need a council referral.We heard you will come back and report in leasing, leasing program and projects how we're.Moving forward with that.Oh, okay. I, I understand that. And I think the five year lease is something I support. It's though I want the parallel track to be a little bit more than coming back and reporting to us. I'd like to.I'm asking you what it's going to take to make it a priority and a priority, among other priorities that's ranked somewhere.And just for clarification, that the priority you're speaking about is the paved park.It's related to the paved park. It's more directly related to Building 29.That is demolishing the building or is it figuring out where a deep park is in relation to other parks?We know.That's what I'm not sure what you're speaking.About.It's demolishing the building.Okay, so that's what I thought they might get about. But let me. So that's the first I want to clarify. You're really asking, how do we prioritize demolishing the building?Mm hmm.Okay. So that's why I said earlier that I don't think that we necessarily have three votes to prioritize demolishing a building ahead of coming up with when we're actually going to need the building demolished. In regards to how does that fit in with the building of the paved park?Because I personally would not want to demolish a building just to have it be demolished when we haven't figured out when we're going to be able to do bigger improvements that require that. I think there are things that we can do to make that area more accessible.And we have a lot of other park work we're doing. So so that's why I was saying that. I don't know if that's the ask, how do we prioritize that? I would think it does need to be a referral.It backs it back up a little bit from that because. If we have five years of five year lease and at the end of that five years we have no plan for what happens, then it kind of rolls out and the part gets rolled out with it because.That that building is right next to the wetland. And part of the removal of that building is a key in getting outside funding to expand that wetland. So I think that it's not as simple as I just want the building torn down.That's its that's not it. I want to make sure that when the building is ready to be taken down, we don't have a problem with losing tenants.So Vice Mayor Matt, R-S.C.. I think the mayor is actually right. We are now veering too far off of what we have on the agenda.And there'll be a council referral.That made that yes member.I'd like to move approval of the ordinance approving a lease and authorizing the city manager to execute documents necessary to implement the terms of a five year lease for the Dreyfus Capital Partners of California LLC for Building 29, located at 1701 Monarch Street at Alameda Point second grade.Any Council comments?

Can you hear me? And you can see my presentation.Yes. Thank you.Good afternoon. Members of the city council. My name is Frank Benefield and I'm an associate city planner with community planning and Development. I am here today to present an overview of my amendment 5061 very strict. Subject property is located in Council District one.There are just neighborhoods. The property is located north of I-70, along Perry Street, south of First Avenue. It's approximately 9370 square feet. And it it is currently occupied by a single unit residence. The property is currently in the urban single unit, Keystone District, and the applicant is proposing to rezone to urban single unit C1 to allow foran accessory dwelling unit. The USOC, one allows for the Urban House and the detached accessory dwelling unit building sports. The maximum height for a house is 30 to 35 feet and 24 feet for the detached 82. The existing zoning is urban single unit C, which allows for a minimum standard size of 5500 square feet.Most of the surrounding properties are also shown you, as you see. So it's occupied by a single unit, resident residence, as mentioned, and it's surrounded by mostly other single unit residences. This slide shows the existing area with the site of the proposed rezoning on the top.Right, and just some images to show the residential character of the neighborhood on the bottom right, on left. Speaking of the process and informational notice of the application was sent in mid-January 2020. Notice a planning board was sent on May 4th.A notice of public hearing was sent on June 29 and the property was properly noticed. Planning board recommended approval on May 20th and as a result, no comments have been received by the public or registered neighborhood organizations. The Denver zoning code has five review criteria, which I will go over.The first criteria is consistency with adopted plans. There are three plans applicable to lease rezoning. The first one is comprehensive plan 2040. The second one is Blueprint Denver, and the third one is housing and inclusive Denver. The rezoning is consistent with several of the strategies in Comprehensive Plan 2040, but I will just go over a couple ofthem. This MAP amendment will promote equity by creating a greater mix of housing options in every neighborhood, and it will lead to an environmentally resilient Denver by promoting infill development where infrastructure and services are already in place.Now, do you think?The subject property is mapped as part of the urban neighborhood context. The context is described as containing small, multi-unit, residential and mixed use areas that are typically embedded in one unit and two unit residential areas. BLOCK buttons are generally regular with a mix of early access, and they have been described as having a high degree of walkability, likability and good access to transit with less reliance on cars. The future places map designates the subject property as low residential place. This place type has predominantly single and two unit uses, and accessory dwelling units are appropriate. Berry Street is designated as a local street, which is mostly characterized by residential uses.The growth area in bloom in Denver is all other areas of the city. These areas are anticipated to see a 10% employment growth and 20% health growth by 2040. Lupron also includes specific policy recommendations. Housing policy number four talks about diversifying housing choice through the expansion of accessory dwelling units throughout all residential areas.Housing an inclusive Denver encourages expanding the development of accessory dwelling units, doing something device affordable and mixed use housing and as a wealth building tool for low and moderate income homeowners. Therefore, the proposed rezoning is consistent with the recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan Blueprint Denver and Housing and Inclusive Denver because it will expand housing options and allowthe development of an accessory dwelling unit. Stuff also finds that their request signing meets the next two criteria. The rezoning will result in uniformity of district regulations, and it will further the public health, safety and welfare, primarily through its implementation of adopted plans.Stuff does find that there is a justified circumstance for this MAP amendment, with the newly adopted vision for accessory dwelling units in all residential areas of Denver. Lastly, the proposed zoning is consistent with urban neighborhood context, residential district and the intent of the USOC one district.Stuff does work. I'm in approval. Based on finding all review criteria has been met and that concludes that presentation.All right. Very good, Fran. Thank you for that. Questions from members of council.See here.All right. Councilman Flynn.Madam President. Fran, good to see you again. Does the does this zone district define where the ADU goes on the lot? You said this would be a detached ADU. Does this designation also allow an attached ADU?So this particular one would be a deep touch to you because the owner wants to build it on top of the garage. So this would be a detached one, but it could be attached. It could be like if you wanted to.Like the rezoning doesn't specify if it needs to be detached to attach, so it could be potentially detached.Oh, okay. So the zoned as the zoned district itself doesn't differentiate between attached and detached. It either could be done here under this.Yes, in this case.Okay. Thank you. That's all I have. Madam President, thank you.All right. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Seen no other questions? The public hearing for Council Bill 20 dash 0520 is closed. Comments by members of Council Councilmember Sandoval.Thank you. Madam President, as my colleagues know, we're getting a lot of bees in northwest Denver. And my office has a standard policy where we talk to the applicant. We have them reach out to the registered neighborhood organization and build their case.Do so. My colleagues know a lot of my registered neighborhood organizations are not taking the positions on accessory dwelling units. So this neighborhood is represented by Berkeley, Regis, United Neighbors, which is the predominant R.A. in that neighborhood. And they have decided not to take any positions on an avenue.And so I will mention that as these come forward in each neighborhood, that does not take a position, because I think that's important, because I really do do my best to get letters of support or opposition from an R.A. and from neighbors.I don't live far from here. It's a great little area. This is near Regis University. I think an accessory dwelling unit would be welcome in this area to help some of the housing, as are the students who attend Regis without having to change the density of that, a single family established neighborhood.So with that, I would ask that all my colleagues support this application. Thank you.Thank you. Councilwoman Sandoval. Seen no one else in the queue? Madam Secretary, roll call.In. I.Sawyer.I. Taurus.I. Black. Hi. CdeBaca.I.All right. When I.Heard it.I. I.Ashlan.I.Can I?Madam President.I. Madam Secretary, please close the voting and announce the results.12 eyes.12 eyes. Council Bill 520 has passed. Councilman Herndon, would you please put Council Bill 524.\nSummary:", "answer": "A bill for an ordinance changing the zoning classification for 5061 Perry Street in Regis.\r\nApproves an official map amendment to rezone property from U-SU-C to U-SU-C1 (allows an accessory dwelling unit), located at 5061 Perry Street in Council District 1. The Committee approved filing this item at its meeting on 6-9-20."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThe report of the Transportation and Utilities Committee Agenda Item on Council Bill 120145 Naming the pedestrian bicycle bridge across the Interstate five connecting North 100 Street to First Avenue Northeast as the John Lewis Memorial Bridge. The committee recommends that the bill pass.Thank you. As chair of the committee. I'll just say a couple of sentences before I turn it over to the chief sponsor, Councilmember Juarez. This is Councilor Juarez Juarez's proposal to name the North Quay pedestrian bridge after national civil rights leader John Lewis.At our committee, we heard powerful testimony from former County Councilmember Larry Gossett and the current president of North Seattle College, Dr. Crawford. Our committee unanimously recommended this item. Councilmember Juarez, you like to address this item?Well, thank you. Council President Lewis Pro-Tem guy. I also want to thank him for her role as a co-sponsor. So thank you very much for letting us bring this through your Transportation Utilities Committee. And it is correct, it was voted unanimously to recommend that the city council pass this bill.This bill, as stated, would establish the legal name of the pedestrian and bike bicycle bridge connecting North Seattle College to the North Gate Light Rail Station Opening October 2nd as the John Lewis Memorial Bridge. As a former community matter member and then a constituent and now an elected, I have been involved in the pedestrian bridge since atleast 2015, and I think we raised we finally got it up to about $56 million with the city of Seattle putting in the most money to make this happen. This bill constitutes months, if not years, of collaboration with our community.We started by completing a citywide inventory of all the names of public infrastructures in the city of Seattle. And what we found was that there was very little bipoc representation citywide and in District five. There's currently not a single school, park, street, library, pool, community center or any natural habitat such as a river, lake creek or streamnamed after an African-American leader. And we do know that through sale public schools, we have the vocal staff, Robert Eagle Staff School, which I knew Bob and the Northgate Elementary School, I understand, will be changed soon to the James Baldwin School.So I'm working citywide and with community. We considered many names for this bridge and decided to put forward the name of the honorable U.S. Representative John Lewis, who we lost a year ago last July. John Lewis passed away on July 17, 2020, after serving as a U.S. representative for Georgia's fifth Congressional District for more than three decades. In honor of his incredible life and legacy as a civil rights icon and voting rights advocate, I'm sponsoring this bill along with Councilmember Purple, to name the pedestrian bicycle bridge in Northgate, the John Lewis Memorial Bridge. I was joined in committee by two incredible community members, former King County Council member Larry Gossett and president of North SteelCollege, Dr. Charmaine Crawford. Both Councilmember Gossett and Dr. Crawford support the naming to recognize and remembered the vital nationwide impact John Lewis made during his time as a civil rights activist, activist, advocate, and as a member of Congress.We have some interesting comments in during this period in the last year about naming John Lewis after this particular bridge. And again, I just want to point out something that it should be obvious, but this is why we have this opportunity to look at places and memorialize people and that we remember, to be honest to the history, not only about who gets remembered, but how they get remembered and why they get remembered. John Lewis was a friend of Councilmember Gossett, and Dr. Charmaine Crawford spoke both times about how she met Mr. John Lewis. But all of this side, I don't think that we should have to qualify any black leader, any indigenous leader, any Asianleader, any LGBTQ leader. I don't think that we have to qualify that. They have some incorrect, incredible, direct connection to the city of Seattle. I don't think George Washington was here or Lincoln or, you know, Franklin or, you know, Jason Lee or, you know, let's see.I can't think of other names. They're everywhere, as you all know. And I think we should also point out that John Thornton, where we have Thornton Creek in Thornton Place, was a railroad speculator who never came to King County or Seattle and actually lived and died in Clough County.But got his name, got the title for the creek up here through the Bureau of Land Management in 1889. And I'm not saying that to disparage people who wanted that name. I understand and I get it. And we have sorted creek and we have in place.But I think it's time that we we opened that that lens that there are other people that have made this country great and they didn't necessarily have to physically be here, though John Lewis did come to the University of Washington, I believe, in 2017, because in particular, when people of that greatness, of that magnitude change our mindsand our hearts, we owe it not only to the Honorable John Lewis, but to everybody to remember who John Lewis was. I want to close up by saying something that I also shared in committee and I shared with other folks as well, is that we believe that when loved ones leave us that they don't actually leave usand they are alive as long as we say their name. So it's important that we say John Lewis's name so people know who John Lewis was, what he did, and what he did for this country and how he what he committed to, not only in his personal life, but his professional life.There are very few heroes that we have like that, quite frankly, that I actually believe in. So this bridge is both symbolic and poetic. When John Lewis led the civil rights march in from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, as you know, they were attacked by state troopers attempting to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge.The violent attacks were recorded and disseminated throughout the country and the images proved too powerful to ignore. That became Bloody Sunday as the day was labeled, which sped up the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. And as I shared in committee, that was the 1965, 56 years ago.And as you all know, we are still fighting for the John Lewis Voting Act. We are still fighting for a bedrock of our democracy and people's right to vote. And that is still going on. And I'm hoping that this bridge will be a reminder and not just a reminder for the city of Seattle, but for anybody whatthis bridge means and also how we commemorate and honor those who have done great things for our country. So I know that some of you've heard that what they would call the Honorable John Lewis, that he was a conscious of the Congress, that he was a true bridge builder who could work across the aisle to achieve progress. And I believe that I hope that he inspires all of us as leaders and future leaders to do the same. So as I shared last Friday, Councilmember Larry Gossett and Dr. Crawford also appeared on Converge Media's Morning Show update, where they went to greater detail about this proposal and their relationship with the great John Lewis.And if you get a chance, I hope you can go back and look at that video. So with that, I want to thank all of you that have worked with us, and particularly you, Councilmember Lewis, who was an early believer in this.And some of the conversations I had with Councilmember Strauss, Councilmember Herbold and others. And with that, I would hope that we would pass that we would pass this bill today. Thank you.If you counsel or as colleagues, any other comments on the bill? Okay.

Thank you very much. Thank you. And colleagues. That takes us to item six on our agenda. This is proposed ordinance 2020 157, which would ban the sale and discharge of fireworks in unincorporated King County. We will receive a letter from council staff and we received a full briefing at our February 17th meeting and will receive abriefing from Jake Tracy. Just a brief update in a moment, but is the sponsor I wanted to offer some initial comments and then introduce Mr. Tracy in July of 2019. Mr. Roland, Sonny Kennedy, a 70 year old veteran, and his two dogs were killed in a house house fire in White Center.It was caused by fireworks. In addition to the tragic loss of life, two homes were destroyed and 12 residents were displaced. While there are plenty of reasons to support an Army full ban on consumer fireworks in unincorporated King County, I'm motivated to do so because of my center's loss.We never want this to happen again in any community. The injuries, death and destruction caused by fireworks year after year are preventable. The overwhelming majority of jurisdictions within King County cities, park districts in the national forest understand this and have already banned fireworks.It's time for King County to do the same. Residents in unincorporated King County deserve to have the same protections that the majority of their counterparts in incorporated areas already enjoy. We've heard from residents and from first responders across unincorporated King County, overwhelmingly expressing support for banning fireworks.They've told us again and again that they're fed up and they want our help. And the King County Fire Commissioners Association has been clear. It expressed their support for a full ban on fireworks. And I know that representatives of the fireworks industry have voiced their opposition and concerns and are trying to tell us that a full banwon't work. I'm not surprised they benefit from financially from the sale of these products that don't have to deal with the fallout from fireworks have on our residents and first responders. It makes sense that they try to confuse the issue but urge you to see through those tactics.I look forward to our discussion and our work today. Mr. Tracy. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Jake Treacy, council staff. The materials for this item begin on page ten of your packet. Since I gave a D. Can you hear me okay?You can. And, Mr. Tracy, if I can also interject, in addition to the package, we have a council amendment package that was emailed out this morning. I would call the members attention to it was sent by Ms.. Stedman at 807 this morning.So if members haven't already, I'm hoping that in front of them I would call their attention to that. I'm sorry, Mr. Tracy. No worries. Thank you, Mr. Chair. So, since I gave a detailed briefing last time, I'll keep this short.Proposed ordinance 2020 10057 would prohibit the retail sale and discharge of consumer fireworks, as defined in our CW Rule 70, 77 and unincorporated portions of King County. These consumer fireworks are shown in the handout on page 49 of your packet.The legislation would raise the fine for fireworks violations from $250 per violation to $1,000 per violation. It would also move standards for public displays of fireworks in unincorporated King County to a new chapter, align definitions in state law, and limit public displays of fireworks to two per property per year with permits from the fire marshal.As I mentioned last time, council members previously provided amendment concepts for super review and public notice. The concepts are listed on page 13 of your packet. If this legislation were to move out of committee today, I would need to be informed of any additional amendment concepts by close of business this Friday, March 19th, so they could beincluded in that council hearing notice. I would like to note an error in the staff report. My apologies. The correct date for the deadline of concepts is this Friday, March 19. There are also two amendments for discussion today, but I will pause there for any questions first.We also have Jim Chan and Chris Ricketts from permitting here. Questions for Mr. Tracy. Seeing none. Mr. Tracy. Okay. Amendment one starts on page three of that amendment packet that the Chair just mentioned. Amendment one would allow for the sale, possession and use of fireworks that are defined as ground and hand-held sparkling devices in the Washington administrativecode. These include. And if you go back to that handout that I mentioned, that is on page 13. Those are on page 49 of your packet. You'll see some of these listed there. So the ones that would still be allowed under Amendment One are the wire, sparkler and dipstick.Cylindrical fountain.Cone, fountain.Illuminating Torch wheel. Round Spinner and flitter. Sparkler and toy smoke device. Other consumer fireworks, including aerial devices and multiple tube devices, would be banned for sale and use. The amendment would retain regulations that are proposed to be removed as part of the ordinance that pertain to fireworks stands and would also retain existing code language and limits onthe dates and times during which fireworks can be sold. So to summarize, this amendment would retain existing quota balance for the sale and use of ground and hand-held sparkling devices, but would ban aerial devices and multiple tube devices.If the amendment is adopted, there's a title amendment to one that would go along with it. Would you like me to bring Amendment two or pause there? Let's pause there. We don't have anything. We have no motions before us at this time.Are there technical questions on Amendment One that Mr. Tracey has just briefed? See none. Mr. TRACY If you give the a the same level of briefing to Amendment two and then we'll take up the legislation. Sure. So Amendment two would make changes with references to penalties and enforcement.It would retain the existing $250 fine for fireworks violations, which is proposed to increase to $1,000 under the underlying proposed ordinance. It would also delay issuance of penalties for violations of the ordinance pertaining to use or discharge of consumer fireworks for one year after the ordinance was effective during that one year period.Warnings and education would be given to violators rather than monetary or criminal penalties. Finally, the amendment would request that the executive conduct the study on and make a recommendation for a way to provide an immediate, unarmed non-police response to fireworks violations during the 4th of July season.That study and recommendation will be due by June 30th of 2022. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you. Any technical questions on Amendment two? Councilmember Lambert.Thank you. We had this discussion years ago when we were talking about not having police due enforcement of handicapped parking places. So this is not a new discussion, but who would we get to do the enforcement? And that that would be the question about who would have the authority to do that and under what code would webe able to give them that authority?Thank you, Councilmember. So the objective of this amendment, as it is written, would be to have the executive do that study and come back with a recommendation and possibly code amendments that would, if necessary, to allow whoever they recommend to do that work.So it's not identified in this amendment. It's just requesting that the executive study that and come back with a recommendation.Well, they might want to look at the body of work that was done before because it came back with some very interesting results. Thank you.Any other technical questions of amendment to. See none are without a recall on Councilmember Bell duty to for the purposes of making a motion.Thank you, Mr. Chair. I move. Adoption of Ordinance 2020 10057 with a do pass recommendation.Thank you. Councilmember Bellevue, she's moved adoption of ordinance 2020 157 amendments. Councilmember Yvonne Roukema. I believe Amendment one would be in order. But, Mr. Chair, I'm sure I'm sure this Councilwoman Boesky, a lot of questions asked that wasn't of a technical nature.Okay. I understood the opening to be of technical and leave. So it would now be an appropriate time, is it? What I was doing was what I was trying to do is encourage the actual debate and discussion about amendments when they were before us.If if you but you're welcome to ask your question now, I would expect both amendments to be offered and fully debated and discussed. Again this is in the regarding the underlying legislation and in the staff report. Just I'll just ask it to my head.Mr.. Thank you. And you've been very good about this idea, and I think it's been a trend that we're trying to do here, and that is to include equity in social justice analysis in terms of impacts of legislation in our staff work.The legislation here would impose a new criminal penalty. And I'm just I didn't see in the staff report any analysis of the impacts of that from a from a racial and social justice perspective. And I'm wondering if it's there or not.There was no ESG analysis done on this legislation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the debate. Thank you. Councilmember Councilmember by Rick. I thank you, Mr. Chair. I move adoption of amendment number one. Amendment one is before us. Council number one right there.And thank you, Mr. Chair. First of all, I want to thank you personally and professionally for your work with this issue. I think it's an indication of how sensitive you are to your district and how you responded to the bystander tragedy.There's not one of us on this floor or on this podium, which does not feel that what happened there was a tragedy and we never want to see it repeated again. And I thank you for responding so quickly to the center issue time and time again during our discussion this morning.Many of the speakers talked about their Community of Rights Center, and they clearly have a great deal of pride. Today, we're not just dealing with White Center, however, we're dealing with Kane County as a county. Ever since this proposal was introduced last year before COVID 19 struck.I've been working with concerned parties on both sides of this issue, including constituents, nonprofits, first responders and the fireworks industry. In fact, I was on the phone late last night with a local fire chief as well, who is very much supporting what you're trying to do.I feel that this amendment strikes an appropriate compromise that is workable for all parties. As you know, Mr. Chairman, my district has both unincorporated urban and rural areas. I have Auburn and Better Way who have two different directions dealing with fireworks.We frankly frequently hear from constituents who complained about fireworks around the 4th of July, as well as during Seahawk games. Let's hope this season is also going to be an opportunity for fireworks on the field. The complaints are almost always directed out loud.Aerial fireworks often shut off during the time of year where they are or are not permitted. My amendment would allow for the continued sale and use of only ground based fireworks. Boughton wheels ground spinners in unincorporated Kane County during the current permitted period for sales and use.Which sale is June 28? The July 4th use is July 4th. My amendment does not include aerial fireworks such as roman candles, mortar shells or parachute, resulting in those aerial fireworks being banned in unincorporated Kane County. The amendment as drafted is modeled after the city of Auburn in my district.After consultation with Mayor Bacchus and others. This proposal currently allows for ground based fireworks during specific times of the year. In addition to the city of Auburn. Leigh Ann Geer in the City of Civic also and my district commit ground based sale during conversations with the community and colleagues alike.I've heard a variety of concerns and I feel the same with the concerns raised. But enforceability is important. While still there, there will be enforcement challenges. This proposal clearly distinguishes between what is allowed, ground based and what is not allowed.Aerial. Response to community organizations and nonprofits. And if ever there was a time we've needed the help of the nonprofits to provide a safety net for so many good causes in our community, it's been during COVID 19. They rely on fireworks sales to raise money for their organizations by allowing for the continued sale of ground based fireworksduring that period of time frame. Mr. Chair, again, I want to say to you, you've done yeoman's work in trying to bring this issue to the forefront. I believe this is a positive step forward. We want to do good, not just feel good.We want to do good, not just feel good. And I believe this amendment does good. Thank you. Council member of Great Power. I appreciate the work you've done in crafting this, in talking to so many people throughout the community and bringing it to us for discussion today.However, I do need to oppose it now. Ask my colleagues to join me in not supporting it. It essentially allows the continued sale and discharge of what the industry might term in some conversations. Safe and sane fireworks. What I might refer to is so-called safe and sound fireworks.Many feel that these products might be safe, but there's certainly evidence to the contrary. Smoke bombs with which would be allowed under this amendment, supported the 2017 Eagle Creek Forest Fire in Oregon. It burned nearly 50,000 acres and cost an estimated $40 million.The fire destroyed several structures, including homes where residents lost everything. Hikers had to be rescued in the fire, which happened during the peak of the tourism season, negatively impacting businesses in the area in 2000. Just last year on the El Dorado Fire in California was started by a smoke bomb used to the gender reveal party.This fire resulted in 23,000 acres burned, multiple homes destroyed and the death of a veteran firefighter. And even some of the products that we think of or people want to believe is the most safe. Sparklers. According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, sparklers are typically heralded as safe and sane.They make up 12% of firework related injuries. They burn at a temperature of up to 2000 degrees Fahrenheit, which is hot enough to melt some metals and ignite clothing and cause third degree burns in a matter of seconds.And a partial ban continues to compromise the safety of our first responders and our residents. I believe it's really essential that we listen to fire commissioners, first responders, medical professionals who deal with this every day. And in fact, we received a letter last month from the South King Fire and Rescue that covers much of unincorporated and urbanareas in South King County. They say this city they cover said away in Des Moines, among other cities. And in the letter, they say these cities, like many others in King County, have banned the retail sales and use of fireworks.The lack of a uniform regional approach to this problem causes confusion in our population and reduces the compliance in areas that are actually banned. So I would ask members to join me in not supporting this amendment. Further discussion.Other councilmember closed debate coalition base, please. Yes, unless you want to finish your for me. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you again and again. You've done it. Really. And I hope people in the White Center area understand that, because I was speaking from the heart.We both are strong advocates for our communities. We've been in politics because we know that that's our job, is to be an advocate for our community. And you have truly done that on this issue. But time and time again, I heard the folks from White Center talk about their community.And I am very sensitive to their committee and I make sure that the commissioner is home on July 4th. That said. This is a county wide proposal, and it works collaboratively with the industry to find a workable solution that does not result in a county government legislating small businesses out of existence.Most importantly to me was the addition that one of our colleagues pointed out. It's about the opportunity to educate the public and a full commitment from the industry to partner with King County, to sponsor a safety and education program to better inform the community on the difference between aerial fireworks and the proposed safe and shame ground basedfireworks and deregulated novelties in closer fields of proposal as a workable solution. It's enforceable because it deals with ground based as opposed to aerial, and it improves community safety but does not result in undue hardship. Itinerary. Nonprofits or small businesses in unincorporated King County.Thank you. All those in favor of Amendment One, please signify by saying hi. All right, I. Those opposed nay now in the opinion of the cheering the needs of it provision.The provision.Madam Quirk, if I. If I could have the clerk, please call the roll on Amendment One.Thank you, Mr. Chair. Councilmember WG now. Councilmember Dombrowski, i. Councilmember Dunn.I.Councilmember Coles now. Councilmember Lambert, I. Council member of the ground now. Councilmember Brown right there. I council members online.No.Mr. Chair.No.Mr. Chair, the vote is for EIS Council members Dombrowski, Dunn, Lambert and Bond mate Bauer and five no council members. She called Wells up the ground for her line. And McDermott.Thank you. The amendment fails an amendment to. Council members are alone. All right, that's for me. Thanks, Mr. Chair. I've grappled with this issue a lot ever since we first heard it last year. I've always said repeatedly that the public health aspects of this are super valid and that everything that Councilmember McDermott has been saying has beentrue in my district as well. I hear from countless residents about the pollution, the noise, the impact on pets and veterans. But the other side of this has been the concern, essentially that Councilmember Dombroski brought up, which is the ESG concern, and specifically the increase in law enforcement contacts between law enforcement and communities of color, the highfines and fees on a low income community, the interferences with cultural practices, and the revenues that are that our nonprofits and churches would take. My amendment would fix all of these things entirely, but it would be a step in the right direction.First of all, it reduces the fee from $1000 to $250 to just make sure that we're not having insurmountable fees for potentially low income people in that area. And also, it requests that the executive create a plan for using non-police, unarmed enforcement.And we don't know exactly what that looks like yet. It could be code enforcement officers. It could be something else within the sheriff's department that's unarmed and civilian owned. But I think we have to be really careful, especially in light of the environments we've seen in the past year or more about creating more contacts between police andcommunities of color, especially for something that may not require an armed response. And this, of course, would only apply to the things that we as King County are making illegal. If there are state level things that are illegal, like firecrackers in the eighties, the things that make cars shake, we don't have a say in who enforces that. So the law enforcement sheriff's department would still be able to enforce that. The other aspect of this is the fact that it would delay enforcement by a year. So in the year where this would otherwise take effect, instead of finding people or giving them criminal penalties, we would request that our sheriff's office do an educational campaign instead. So instead of imposing penalties, go around with informational information, informational packets, and telling people about this new regulation and the impact of fireworks. I think it's a compromise legislation. I don't think it addresses all of the ESG impacts fully, but I do think it's a step in the right direction.And I ask my colleagues to support it. Councilman Rizal. My staff is suggesting that you should formally move adoption of the amendment. Don't move. Mr. Chairman. Sticklers on things like that. Thank you. Council members. Hello. The concerns that you voice and the voice you bring of your constituents is true for people across the county.And your amendment does it, I think, does an excellent job in addressing the concerns both of of fireworks in that that we've heard from constituents, but also of fair enforcement and equitable enforcement in grappling with how to do that better than we've done it in the past.I appreciate your amendment very much and look forward to joining you in supporting supporting it today. Their Council member, Lambert.I will be supporting this amendment. I do believe $1,000 is a very high fine, and I do like the idea of making sure that people have some time to get used to it. 4th of July Fireworks. This is a tradition that people have enjoyed for many, many years, and it will be difficult for everybody to know thatthere's been a change. So I like the but for a year I am concerned though and so I'm okay with it being a study, but it needs to in that study, look at what would be the issues that come up when you are taking something away from somebody.And I know that there are people that spend thousands of thousands of dollars on fireworks. And when you tell them you can't do that and you take it away, it has to be somebody that has some authority that is respected.So I'll be interested in seeing who that group is. And also in light of the experience we've had before when we tried to do something similar. So I agree this doesn't solve everything. I wish the First Amendment had passed, but I will be supporting this.In discussion. Council Member Col Wells.Thank you, Mr. Chair. I answer in supporting this amendment. I think it's a smart one that applies the sensible equity lens to enforcement energy commission around the new regulations. But I think even more so. I think it's clickable to people across the unincorporated King County.I have had some real concerns about enforcement, and I believe that the way that Councilmember Sol Hawaii has presented the intent of his amendment really satisfies me that we will be able to reach a good solution for this kind of vexing issue on enforcement.Thank you.Thank you for the discussion. And Dombroski Councilmember Dombroski. Thank you, Mr. Chair. The increase in interaction between law enforcement and young people who I think are the primary users, I would say, of these fireworks, has been a grave concern of mine with respect to this legislation and the additional criminalization of of contact and increasing young folks connectionto our criminal legal system. And the adverse consequences that to often follow has been a real concern of mine. And so I think this amendment, which, as I understand it, would decriminalize the offense of violating the ban in terms of discharge, convert it to.And I'd like to be correct ma'am wrong is just a civil infraction fine of $250 plus the additional study for non-police response is helpful because my customer one right. Bauer's amendment also did to that and in a little bit of a different way.I still think that the response of when folks will call 911, assuming the spangles into effect and the police will come unless we come up with another system from the study. And I think that concerns me in terms of what follows from that, in terms of increased interaction and with our young people.So I'm definitely happy to support this amendment. I think it goes a long way, if not all the way in addressing some of those concerns. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair. Councilmember Dombrowski requested that the this amendment would keep the status quo, which is a $250 fine and or a misdemeanor.Oh, I see. So it would still be a misdemeanor? It could potentially be charged as a misdemeanor, yes. Okay. That is what is in the existing law today. And that's what would continue with this, with the exception of that one year period in which there would be no fines or criminal penalties.All right. Well, I'm going to support the amendment, but I think that continues to be a serious concern of mine. On adopting the ban Is the criminalization of this conduct primarily engaged in by young folks during a limited time of the year?Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you for the discussion. Council members are allowed to close. I urge your support. Thank you. All those in favor of Amendment Two, please signify by saying hi. I call on those opposed nay. The ayes have it.Amendment two is adopted. Discussion on ordinance 2020 157 as amended. Councilmember Banducci.Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I, as you know, join Don as a co-sponsor of this measure early on. And this is I know that this is challenging for some, but for me, this is almost a no brainer. Prior to serving on the King County Council, I served as a city councilmember and one of those cities that hashad a ban for a number of years. In my district, almost all of the cities have bans, and about the only place where there isn't one is the unincorporated Sammamish Valley. And so and there's a reason for the bans.We've heard about it a lot. It's and it's about public safety. The statistics have been quoted by our fire commissioners, by you, Mr. Chair, by others. And the anecdotes are tragic and happen every year somewhere. They happen to use or using fireworks.Property damage happens every single year. There are dozens of fires in Washington. Thousands of injuries started. And there's an argument to be made that this kind of restriction is even more important in unincorporated King County, which tends to be more forested.And this activity happens during a dry time of year when outdoor fires can be very easily sparked. The psychological impacts, quality of life impacts, and just the list goes on and on. And there's a reason why many, many cities in King County and elsewhere have have enacted these bans, except they do not ban public displays.They allow for permitted displays, but not the kind of unregulated use that leads to the damages that we've seen and heard about year after year. I've heard the arguments and I've listened carefully. I've read all the emails, all the letters.I've listened to everyone who's come to public comment. This has been pending for quite a long time, so we've had very ample time to think through the ramifications. And I will say, the idea that people can still buy fireworks somewhere else is not really the point.The point is that we need to try to make sure people don't use fireworks in a way that is dangerous and damaging to themselves and the community. The idea that prohibition doesn't make a difference is just simply not true.It's just not true in our experience in cities where there have been bans. The amount of fireworks don't go away. And crime doesn't go away because we have laws, but it goes way down. And I especially like that we're thinking more thoughtfully these days.And one of the things I like about this legislation that differs from the one in the city where I used to serve is that we're being more thoughtful about how to address making sure we get the benefits of the law, how to educate people, how to do emphasis and engage with the community to to achieve compliance andthe benefits of compliance without necessarily making a criminal case out of it. And I really appreciate that that part of the amendment that we just passed and the idea that there's not enough enforcement has been raised. If you do rely on sheriff's deputies or place to enforce and, you know, it's such a targeted activity that happens incertain places at certain times, I think it would be very easy to do emphasis regardless of whether you have a whole police force at your disposal or not, if that's the way people choose to go. After we receive back the study that we've now included asking the executive to do to think through other ways of compliance, I'veheard people talk about jobs and the loss of jobs, and that's real. And I hear that, and that is compelling to me. But at some point you have to take a balance when you have to look at the balance between jobs and the safety of the community at large and say that the safety predominates.And in this case, I believe that it does. And then finally and this this really this really was meaningful to me, hearing about nonprofits and the challenges. I mean, we know nonprofits are suffering. Councilmember Yvonne, right. Our speak Ellen spoke eloquently about that.I agree with him completely on this point. We now have a fair amount of time between when this would take effect and today to allow for some some real lead time, too, for nonprofits to look for other ways to raise money.And we should take that seriously and we should be engaged in our districts if there are organizations that are truly going to suffer to try to do what we can as leaders in our communities, to try to help them.But it's not going to happen this 4th of July. So there is quite a bit of time for folks to adopt adapt. Yeah. And for all those reasons, I've been a strong supporter of this legislation from the beginning.I remain so and I'm proud to cosponsor and I will be voting yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair.Thank you for the discussion. Dombrowski. Thanks. I didn't want to jump in. This is a closer call for for me on this chair. I've heard and listened carefully to the debate and looked into it pretty deeply as well.And the concerns raised by residents like Ms.. Dobkin and others from White Center and North Highline are resonate with me. And the risk is certainly there and there are injuries and and things like that. And so when we have a public policy problem like that, I wonder what is the answer here?A proposal is to to ban them. And I agree with Guzman about to achieve that. A ban on say on discharge will likely reduce their use. But I don't think it eliminates that. I mean, I live in a city where they are banned and they go off, you know, all the time.I supported Councilmember One right by his amendment because I thought it was aimed at the most egregious of these. You know, the the new fireworks, I call them new. They're relatively new. We didn't have when I was a kid.The aerial murders, I think, are what really people are bothered by the PTSD in our veterans, if you will, the harm to pets and the jarring nature of those. That's a relatively modern advent in fireworks compared to when I was a kid using them in the cul de sac in unincorporated King County.We didn't have those, you know, we had the little cones, sparklers and things like that. Or if we went down to the reservation, you'd get a bottle rocket, which were which were illegal, of course. So I like councilman one requires precise amendment there to say, let's get rid of the real nasty, dangerous ones and but keep thethe on the ground ones I don't think because of just observation around for July were as you say a majority of the cities I think in our county but not all have banned them. That that it eliminates that.So I'm not sure it's it's a totally effective solution it might help at the margins but got to weigh that against the other impacts and whether it be it was increasing fines and sanctions from our roads division which I opposed to, you know, Councilmember Dutton's zoombombing legislation where we took out the criminal penalties.This is an activity where young people primarily do it because we grow out of it. So we get older and the response is going to be 911 calls with police showing up and a new criminal penalty. And I at the end of the day, I think I'm in just a very different place on that.And I think that the harm that results from that increased interaction is is something I'm very concerned about. Councilmember Xilai's amendment really helped got us going in the right direction. But I think that maybe this should be decriminalized entirely and maybe I can get to a yes or council if we can continue to work in that direction. I do think also that this, you know, with respect to bands not working, the Eagle Creek Fire, which has been mentioned a couple of times now started by smoke bombs, was started in September. In Oregon when a ban was in place.So, you know, as to that's an example of the efficacy of bands, you know, not solving the problem. I looked at, you know, Snohomish County, where they have a live band and then an urban part where there's denser housing and more concentration.I think that that could be something here that might help. In my district in Bothell, it was put to the voters a few years ago. They voted to keep them. They did not vote to ban them. Other jurisdictions have it's kind of a split question.So primarily, Mr. Chair, because of the concerns about the efficacy, my concerns that folks, when you can't go by a safe and sane firework and under councilwoman right bars amendment, which would have been limited to ground stuff locally, you will go folks that want them will go to our tribal communities and then they will have the fullpanoply, the aerial rockets and mortars, the stuff we really that are problematic. I think that and really with the criminal penalty, that's that's a deal killer for me on this legislation despite my concerns and sympathy for what is bringing forward the legislation and the motivation for it.I understand what you're trying to do. So for today, I'm going to be a no. But maybe if we could decriminalize this, this new conduct that we're outlawing for council, I could be a yes thanks to I'm trying to share my perspective.Lambert.Thank you, Councilmember Lambert.Thank you. I agree with everything the previous speaker said, and I am very concerned about the criminalization. I am concerned about a lot of things here. You know, we just had a horrendous fire in my district, which took out an apartment building, displaced many families.And it was because of cigarets. We not too long ago had another tremendous fire that was horrible. That was started because of a candle. So we're not banned. Can't banning candles and cigarets. And it's kind of a personal responsibility to educate yourself and your family members about how to do things in a safe and sane way.I appreciated the work that was done by council member by night. Also, prohibitions haven't worked in the past and I don't think it's going to work here. It's a tradition and I'm sorry to see so many American traditions being wiped out.So I would like to see us do two things before a final vote at council. One is to decriminalize. And secondly, it is to potentially limit the number of days when you can shoot off the fireworks. I think if it were limited to just the 4th of July and just New Year's Eve, that that would make theiranimals or dogs or horses our safety. And I think that that would really help a lot in reducing the number of days. I'm not that you can sell even some of those days, but the discharge being limited. So I think there's work to be done between now and Tulsa, and I hope that we can consider those ideas. Thank you.Further discussion. I too close. I want to thank my colleagues for their thoughtful work over the more than a year since I first introduced legislation to accomplish this goal. And our work in discussion today. We're here because Mr. Kennedy shouldn't have died.His death was a tragic accident and heartbreakingly preventable. After after learning about what happened in North High Line, I was determined to introduce this ordinance banning the sale and discharge of consumer fireworks in unincorporated King County. Fireworks are dangerous.That's why 25 jurisdictions across King County have already banned them. And the King County Fire Commissioners Association and others who serve on the front lines during the 4th of July holiday have been clear. Ban all consumer fireworks. That bright line would help with the public's confusion in enforcement and with enforcement itself.And I'm not naive. I don't believe that it will stop every firework. I live in a city with a ban. There are fireworks that are ignited around my. In my neighborhood. Few very few laws, if any, have 100% compliance.But the risks posed by consumer fireworks are too great for us not to act. And there is a demonstrated reduction in fireworks use in jurisdictions with bans. We actually heard somebody today offer testimony that they live in a jurisdiction with a ban and they travel to another jurisdiction hours without a ban in order to ignite fireworks.Further compounding the issue in unincorporated King County. We have a therefore, we have a responsibility to send a clear message to residents that fireworks are banned because they're not safe. And I want to emphasize the risk to family, neighbors and the environment for a minute.I've heard some people claim that it's not fair to be told what they can shoot off fireworks in the run on their own property. But it does affect the entire community. The chemicals in the smoke and fireworks may affect people with asthma and other respiratory issues.It affects people with post-traumatic stress disorder, veterans, refugees and others. We've heard from someone who is a mental health counselor in today's testimony speaking to that very point. The need to address. This is real and this is the opportunity for us to step up and to be look provide the same level of protection for our constituents forwhom we are the local government. But so many others have. Throughout King County previously, I think members for their work on this issue and recognize that we'll have more conversations before we bring it up in full council. Just over a month from now without Madam Clerk, would you please call the roll?Thank you, Mr. Chair. Council member Banducci. I can't remember Dombrowski.No.Remember? Done?No.Well, I. Council member Lambert now council member of the group of. Councilmember Yvonne. Mike there were.No.Council members on the line.I.Mr. Chair.All right.Mr. Chair, the vote is five eyes, four noes. Those voting no are council members. Dombrowski, Dunn, Lambert and Von. Right there.Thank you. By your vote, we have given a do pass recommendation to ordinance 2020 157 as amended, which will be sent to full council on it. If there is a 30 day notice requirement so on, it will not be even recorded, of course, but after a 30 day notice is given.And again, I'll remind colleagues what Mr. Treacy has said, that when we take this up in April as part of the advertising, we need to advertise amendment concepts. So please have those amendment concepts to Mr. Treacy by this Friday, March 19th.That takes the status of seven inches. Today's agenda motion 2020 131, which would appoint Janice Case as the deputy director of King County Department of Elections. Ms.. Case is here with us today. But first, Randall Randall Askin from the council staff will provide a brief staff report.The one is yours.Thank you, Mr. Chair, and good morning, Council members. For the record, Randalstown and the council staff and the materials for this item begin on page 51 of your meeting packet. As noted by the Chair, a proposed motion 2020 10031 would confirm the appointment of Janice Case as the deputy director of the King County Department of Elections.Ms.. Case has worked for the department for many years, most recently since February of 2020. She has served as the interim deputy director of the department. Prior to that, she has also served the department as an election operations supervisor, a project or a project program manager and an election services manager.With regards to professional certifications, Ms.. Case is a Washington State certified election administrator as well as a national certified elections registration administrator. Additionally, she received a bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Oregon State University. I'll wrap up by noting that county code requires the appointment of the Deputy Director of the Department of Elections to be confirmed bythe County Council as such approval of the proposed motion. Before you would fulfill this requirement and we are joined by Ms.. Keith as well as Julie Wise, the director of the Department of Elections. And, Mr. Chair, that concludes my remarks.Thank you. Director Wise, would you like to make any introductory comments?And can Mr. Chair and members of the Committee for the Record, Julie Wise, your King County Director of Elections, I am exceedingly happy to come before you today to present Ms.. Janice case for confirmation as our elections deputy director.With over 15 years of election administration in both Washington and Alaska State, she brings an incredible amount of depth of knowledge and operational experience to this position. To be frank, she is one of the most talented individuals I have ever met.Janice has served us so well this past year, which surely was the busiest, most challenging and strangest election cycle to date. It truly is Janice's leadership and her organizational skills that kept everything together. Her ability to see both big picture and literally millions of details is astonishing.She is fiercely driven.And always looking.For us to improve. Her creativity, knowledge and dedication are unparalleled. Unparalleled. I simply couldn't think of an individual better suited to serve in this role, and I'm truly grateful I get to work with her every day. I hope you'll confirm Ms..Janice Case as our King County elections deputy director today. Thank you.Thank you, Ms.. Case. Good morning and welcome. Thank you for your patience. And a few words in your defense, perhaps.Yes. Good morning. For the record, my name is Janice Case, deputy director, designee for the Department of Elections. I'd like to thank my council member, Councilmember McDermott, for sponsoring this motion. I am excited for this opportunity and honor.Director Wise has selected me to fill this role. I discovered my passion for working in elections early in my career, and I'm excited to continue to work with Director Wise and the elections team to continue to remove barriers to voting, increase voter engagement, and ensure our elections are secure, accurate and transparent.And I'd be happy to answer any questions.Questions in this case. This case, what you think might be some trends or things for policymakers to be aware of and watch in elections in particular will election administration. I'm in the coming years.I think one of the biggest things we're looking at right now are signature alternatives, alternative options for validating. You are who you are who voted. Young people are very unfamiliar with signing things, and we've also seen discrepancies in signature challenge rates in communities of color and would like to come up with alternatives for for validating signatures.That's more fair and equitable, you think? That's one of the biggest things. And then also, obviously election security and ensuring that people have correct information about how our elections are processed in a secure and accurate manner.Thank you, Mr. Chair. That was member done. Thank you. Thanks so much for painting the house today. Thanks so much for your willingness to serve as deputy director and a very fine elections director. We all respect you out here in District nine, partly because she lives here.One of the things that I wanted is a serious question. Normally, I would have given you a heads up on this, but I want to hear your thoughts. One of the things that happened as a result of the election of 2020, the presidential race is, you know, one candidate screamed from the rooftops that the election was stolenand certain media picked that up and promoted that either message. And and, you know, I have a long history of working with the Department of Elections. I've served on the canvasing board. I've walked through and inspected the cages.I've seen a lot of elections there. And I worked closely with your office over the years. I have a lot of confidence in the department. But there are people right now out there who don't. And for right or wrong, there is a significant trust factor that's gone on there that I think that your office needs to besensitive to. For example, if you're talking to a certain political party right now, they don't have faith or confidence in it. I've done my level best to sort of explain, you know, my experiences there, but they're not necessarily believing it.And so the question I have for you is how will you reach out to certain groups that don't necessarily trust right now the elections generally and more specifically, King County elections to do what you can to earn their trust back?That's my question.I think we've done a lot of work over the years and will continue to do so and in building the trust of voters and the integrity of the election that we have. We're always happy to invite people into the elections office to watch the process.We have our webcams that are displaying the election process 24/7 so folks can watch from home and watch that we're accurately and transparently processing their ballots. And we also have a fantastic communications team that helps get the word out to everyone about how we do process their ballots.So educating them on what our process is and of course, always inviting that feedback and that conversation to have with individuals to help build their trust in our elections process here in King County. Member.I can't move Daniel on you. Sorry. Sorry. Thanks. I'm almost done. Thank you for that response, Kathy. You could be next. I just have a suggestion. Kathy Lambert and I were on a call. Was it last night? Night before?Anyway, one of the things that I think would make sense is if the election senior elections leadership met with both political parties and. And really get gave them an opportunity to walk through the elections, building in the election processing centers yet again to answer questions, to kick the tires, and for you guys to be responsive.I think that would be really good if, for example, we allowed Joshua Freed and the delegation come through there and just begin to build trust again in the process, and it will just help everyone feel more confident in the next series of results.And I think it's a positive step and I hope you consider doing it. Thank you. Member Council member LAMBERT Thank you.So we have been on numerous calls with people that have concerns, and a lot of it has to do with educating what does happen, what the rules are. When I was on the canvasing board, one of the things that really made me pleased was when there was a vote that should have gone Democrat.It was usually the Republicans that were fighting for the Democrat to have the vote and when it should have gone to the Democrat Republican, the Democrats were saying, yes, that's a Republican vote. And it happened so many times that I was so impressed.And when I when they commented about it, they said, the people who are on this board are so interested in making sure elections are fair, that that is the prime goal here. And I saw it playing out time after time, and it really gave me a great feeling about that.That is not how everybody feels right now. And so I think that that's really important that and I know Julie already does this that she needs on a regular basis. And in our conversation she offered it to happen, to continue to happen with both the chairs of the parties.So I thank you for doing that. The one suggestion that I would make is I know you give an annual report and in the annual report, there is no place that I see for a minority opinion. And I know that there was the minority opinion this year, and I think it's important for our voices to be heard. And so I think there should be a minority opinion section so that it alerts us to where are places where there are concerns and whether they are totally valid or partly valid or invalid. They are still concerns and need to be addressed.So I would propose that we have a minority opinion on decisions that would be in the annual report. Thank you.In this case that he cut. Any response? Any comment?I will add that Director wise and I need monthly with both parties and have for the past few years. And we absolutely value our observers and value those relationships and will continue to have those meetings.Colleagues for their questions. I had one, Mr. Chair. Ms.. Director Wise, thank you so much for the great leadership of the Department with respect to the November election. You reconcile every ballot that comes in and we've held in the past 100% reconciliation.I mean, we're talking millions of ballots, literally. How did we do last time on your reconciliation percentage?Councilmember Tim Bousquet. Do you want me or do you want our damage in this case to answer.Whoever whoever wants to high. Janice congratulations the James go for it. It's it's it's.Exciting. I we reconciled once again. Our department has an amazing history, as you said, of of reconciling. And we were also really excited to have more than a million ballots tabulated on Election Day, far surpassing our previous records.And with that many ballots, so completely reconciling is a huge accomplishment for our team. And they did a fantastic job, as always.100%. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks, Mr. Chair. You're very welcome. Further questions. I will obtain a motion to approve ordinance 2020 131. We have before US Ordinance 2020 131 appointing Janice Case as Deputy Director of the Department of Elections.See no further discussion. Madam Clerk, would you please call the wrong.Thank you, Mr. Chair. Councilmember. Did you i. Councilmember DEMBOSKY.I.Councilmember.I.Councilmember Cox. Hi. Councilmember Lambert. I. Councilmember up the grill, I. From number one right there.I.Council members are high.I.Mr. Chair.I.Mr. Chair, the vote is no, not zero nos.Thank you.

There's always something there for everybody in Denver. The fair is starting to become a big symbol of Denver, kind of a microcosm of Denver, everything in Denver and who we are.And I think the more we have this fair, the more we attract more people to celebrate who we are, whether it be in suburbia or something else. I never thought this would somebody on my life, but but it's pretty cool.I hope they have very good local grown honey for those up years.

And I'm honored with the recognition that I have received this day by the City Council, and it will hold a special place in my memory of my time working with each of you.Building on the success and accomplishments we enjoyed today, I have no doubt that the next few years will be quite exciting. You're going to want to be part of it, and if you aren't already involved, I urge you to become so.I can attest you will be gratified many times over. My husband, Mitch, who's here with me tonight, has served as the association's number one volunteer during my tenure. And for that, I am eternally grateful to him. Mitch and I are longtime Alameda residents, and we look forward to greeting you as we continue to dine, shop and supportdowntown activities and events. This certainly is a very special place to live and work. Thank you all. And go niners.Thank you.I would love to have all of you come up for a picture.I'm glad it's still the 24.Oh.Yeah.

The good news is that the speed feedback sign that was broken in November, fixed in early December, broke about a week later, is now fixed as of the end of last week. So we now have two speed feedback signs. One is going in each direction on for inside on the half mile stretch between Tilden, the Fruitvale Bridge and the High and High Street. More good news is that work is continuing for the rapid repeat flashing beacon at Cambridge and for inside.This is the intersection where our neighborhood really would have preferred a four way stop. But city staff has basically told us that the outline and the guidelines for a four way stop is not working for them right now.\nSummary:", "answer": "Proclamation Declaring January 21, 2020 as Janet Magleby Day in the City of Alameda.

Thousand 666 for the My Sister's Keeper program.Great. Thank you. And we did have a comment. Customer Pierce wanted to comment on this.I just I have our director of the health department, Kelly Colby. I wanted to hear a report from her. I think that this is an amazing grant and that we need to really recognize the work that we do and take it outside of our department so that our community can be engaged and understanding what our city's workingtowards. Go ahead.Kelly.Thank you and good evening, honorable mayor and City Council members and I thank you for the opportunity to share about My Sister's Keeper. This new funding of 306,666 from the Governor's Office of Emergency Services, otherwise known as Cal OAS, continues a highly successful program that was previously funded to the Board of State and Community Corrections.So we've been operating this program for the last three years with with the from be from the. Their program is ending. That funding has ended. So we applied to colonias for additional funding to continue the program. The goal of the program is really to reduce victimization and commercial sex sexual exploitation through serving at risk females within thecity of Long Beach. My Sister's Keeper program is an anti-human trafficking program that revolved around the city prosecutor's office and the Long Beach Police Department's directed services program. So it's a court diversion model, which is designed to assist women who are engaged in prostitution related offenses and are likely being human, sexual, you know, victims of sexual trafficking. And so what they really done is start to identify those who are being who are being trafficked. And instead of being identified as criminalizing it, they're moving it to a victim, moving to a victim focus. So the model is really an incredible partnership between the police department, the city prosecutor's office, our service providers and the health department. It's changed the system from viewing trafficked individuals as victims instead of criminals to us. And they've also streamline the process. The police provide citations to women. They give them an order to appear in court on the Monday. So it used to be a month, month and a half out before a person could show up.Now it's if they're seen on Thursday, they come in on Monday, they get a phone call on Monday morning reminding them to show up. And then while they're in court, they're actually provided opportunity to divert from any sort of criminal justice opportunity, instead, two services.So they're provided trauma related services, case management and tattoo removal. In the past year, we've seen over 100 tattoos removed. So the service providers learn about you know, they explain the program. And at that point, they can connect and be diverted from additional opportunities.And with the criminal justice system through the previous My Sister's Keeper, we are able to assess more than 200 women through this project. And in this one, we're going to be looking at, we're seeking to assist 40 more, but also to really look at additional data collection, to understand the long term impacts of this program.So we're excited to continue this great partnership and this important work. And that concludes my report and open for questions.Thank you very much. Customer Pearce, anything else to add to that?I just want to say in Bixby Park is one of the areas in my district where we've had a lot of issues and a lot of constituents concerns. And I've witnessed our police officers and our heart team out there really working directly with some of these women.And it really has made a difference. So I'm proud of this work.

That's right. We did. I think the next one is 22. Is that right?Report from Public Works Recommendation to award a contract to social buy schools for the purchase of bicycles and associated equipment for the expansion of the Long Beach Bike Share program for a total on contract amount not to exceed 431,250 citywide.Thank you. A short update from public works on this.Craig back mayor council members, if you recall, we were before you about a month ago requesting approval to expand our bike share system and council.Did grant that.Approval. We are in the process of ordering those bikes. What you have before you this evening is a further request to order another 100 bikes and why we had pulled these requests apart. This one before you this evening is from a grant source and we have a short timeline to secure those grant dollars.But those grant dollars would allow us to buy an additional hundred bikes and some equipment.And we're requesting approval to add that to the other 500 bikes that we plan to.Expand. So now we're just correct if I'm wrong, but we had we think we purchased 4 to 500 last time. Is that right, Mr.. Beck? So this is an additional hundred on top of that, right?Yeah. So the original bike share rollout was 500 bikes with cycle hop as a vendor cycle hop only delivered 400 of those initial 500 bikes. This 100 before you this evening is finishing up that initial 500. Not to be confusing, but then we came back and council did approve a second 500.So when this is all said and done, we'll have 1000 bike share bikes out.In our community. And just to be clear, we have 400 out now, so we have an additional 600 coming. That is correct. Okay, great. And let me go through Councilman Andrew Smith. Yes.Yes. You know, I support the recommendation to stand in. It's great to see people riding along the bike path and around town. But since the bike program is now several years along, I'd like to see a progress and a performance report that includes frequent or frequency of the rental locations of the bikes and the renewal and thecost figure. You know, I think a council I think as a council person, we would appreciate to know how the progress the program is doing and if there's any way we can improve it for possible. Thank you.Thank you. Councilmember Councilwoman Gonzalez. Councilmember Pearce here. Councilmember pearce.Just make making sure she.Didn't want to speak. Councilmember. Okay. I just wanted to take this moment to say, of course, I approve and also congratulate public works on a great effort with the Amgen race this past week. I know that the love of bikes has grown in the city due to the bike share program.So thank you.Thank you, Councilman Mongo.I agree with Councilmember Andrews. I would be interested in some statistics related to utilization. I know that as they expand across the city. One of the things that I'm very interested in is most bike share programs that I've seen as I've traveled are sponsored, whether it's Kaiser or Memorial, Barnes and Noble.I mean, everywhere I go, there's Sunkist. It's the wheels of the bike, our advertising, the company that pays for the entire program and then really donates back into the health of the community. And so and I know we have a sponsorship program that this council approved that is really partnered through Partners of Parks.And I'd really like to see that either that board or US partner in some way to bring that kind of funding to the city to be able to ensure that this program has sustainability through an outside source. I appreciate you getting grant dollars and I look forward to the expansion to Eldorado Park.Thank you.Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson.Thank you. Quick question, because I'm unclear, are these the North Long Beach bikes?I think Councilmember, we've had had a you and I have had a discussion that our next expansion will go up through Bixby and in the north Long Beach. It's a combination of both these bikes and the previous approved 500.So these are going. These bikes are going in North Palm Beach.These are the previous ones.So these are not. I'm just want a yes or no.Okay. Yes. These are very.Confusing. All right. These are the North Lambie's bikes where they come in.We need to order them through the company. They have roughly a 4 to 6 month delivery time. Okay.Six months from now, we'll have bikes and they're fine. He's got it. Thank you.Councilman Ringa.Actually, that was my question when it got to the seventh. But I can understand the major corridors, but I think that we still need some buy through for our districts in all in whole city. So I think we need to look at expanding the program into some of the other districts.They do not have any. Thank you.Just a quick question, Mr. Beck. How many stations now are at the Olympic? Now you're really testing my memory.I believe we have four different stations.We have them now on campus. Ray, do you have them on campus? Correct.And going to Councilmember Andrews earlier request, we're happy to provide information to you. We have some wonderful heatmap data that really shows the extent of the ridership of our Bikeshare program. So I'll be happy to pull together, report and share.That with you. Okay, great. And I know that we have the the, the, the system out in front of the pyramid outside of the university. But there are also the ones that we wanted inside the campus are inside the campus, correct?Correct. I'm looking at a map right now.It looks like there's actually five stations on CSU above campus.Perfect. And I just want to make sure I know we've said this separately, but just publicly, that I think it's really important that we connect and do the same thing at Long Beach City and that we connect Lombard City to Cal State, Long Beach by bicycle, and that there is a, you know, that clear route and thatconnection from the university to the college as well as PCC and that campus. I just think those hubs at the colleges, universities are really important. So thank you very much.

I am going to hand it over to Councilmember Morales, who's the sponsor of the bill to address the item.Thank you. Council President. The proposed legislation, as Judy just said, would establish Juneteenth as one of 11 legal holidays for city employees. It would automatically cover non-representative employees and cover represented employees subject to their unions agreement. It would not apply to uniformed police and fire employees as those employees establish their holidays by collective bargaining.It would also establish Juneteenth as one of ten parking holidays. I grew up in Texas. So Juneteenth, the Juneteenth celebration isn't new to me and was made a state holiday in Texas in 1980. And I knew as a kid that this day was really special for our black neighbors.I know that some believe making this a holiday diminishes the uniqueness of the celebration by offering it to everyone. But I think it's important that our country acknowledges slavery. This holiday, as we as we recognize it as a city, also allows us to acknowledge the legacy of trauma for generations of black Americans and to demonstrate an understandingof the need to actively pursue an anti-racist society. So establishing Juneteenth as an official city holiday gives us an opportunity to remark on our progress toward achieving that goal and bring awareness to the work that we still have to do.Thank you for those comments.

Proclamation number 473 series of 2019 recognizing May 19th as hepatitis testing day and July 28th as World Hepatitis Day. Whereas May 19th is National Hepatitis Testing Day and July 28 as World Hepatitis Testing Day, HEP Hep C is recognized as the most common blood borne viral infection in the United States.And. WHEREAS, mortality due to hep C is increasing in Colorado partnership, particularly among people born between 1945 and 1965 with over 19,000 hepatitis C related deaths occur annually in the United States. And. WHEREAS, Hepatitis B accounts for almost 14,000 annual deaths in the United States, there are currently about five I'm sorry, 15,436 people in Colorado living withchronic unresolved hepatitis B infection, and fewer than one third of people with chronic hepatitis B are aware of their infection. And. Whereas, Hepatitis B and C cause an estimated 61% of liver cancer. Hepatocellular carcinoma. HTC and the United States and the opioid epidemic is feeling an increase in HPV and HCV positive cases, whereas hepatitis C has infectedan estimated 50,975 Coloradans. As many as 2.7 million American residents and more than 130 million people worldwide, and is a leading cause of cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver transplants in the United States. And. Whereas, hepatitis C can be prevented, testing can identify existing infections, and early diagnosis and treatment can save lives, money and resources.And. Whereas, Liver Health Connection is available as a statewide resource for education testing, linkage to care, patient navigation helpline and other support services. Now, therefore, be it proclaimed by the Council of the City and County of Denver, Section one at the city, the Denver City Council agrees that preventing and treating viral hepatitis as an important public healthinitiative that will improve the quality of life for Denver residents affected by the virus. Section two The Denver City Council proclaims May 19th as hepatitis testing day and recognizes July 28 as World Hepatitis Day.

Your motion to adopt.I move that proclamation 473 series of 2019 be adopted.Has been moved and seconded comments by members of council and Councilman Lopez.Thank you, Mr. President. Every year I have the honor to bring this forward. I think we've carried it since 2009, perhaps every every year. And it's absolutely critical that this that this proclamation come across our desk and in these chambers, because hep-C is absent, there's a cure and it's preventable.And the more people that we get out, particularly the high risk populations to understand Hep C and especially our young people and especially folks that get tested, it's absolutely critical we can prevent these deaths. There's been a lot of research, a lot of resources and just, frankly, a lot of good education.I have seen, you know, I think it was Councilman Garcia at the time represented Council District One who carried this. And in his absence, he wasn't able to. And I took it on and and I took it on because it's dear to me, my grandfather, whose picture I have right here along with my grandmother, my my daughter, my grandfather was born in Ault, Colorado, northern Colorado. My family's from and went to go serve in World War Two. He was a beet worker and really and he went to go server and he served our country in Germany and came back injured and spent his time in Fort fought against Fort Carson.But he he had a blood transfusion after his injury. His Jeep had rolled over an explosive. And the folks who were in the energy besides him were killed. And he rolled over on his knee and crushed his is his his knee had an injury.They gave him a transfusion. We didn't know that that was the cause of his cirrhosis until he had it. And my grandfather has not been with. He played the role. My father has not been here since 2000. My second was his birthday.And I wish that we had the advances and the technology to be able to treat it. Early on, my grandfather would still be here with me and I would really appreciate his advice. Nowadays, they just don't make them like that anymore.And it's sad that my grandfather only got to see 72 years of life. There are a lot of people and we're losing our war to generation. There are a lot of baby boomers. There are a lot of folks who need to be tested.Everybody needs to be tested. We all should be tested for things like this. So we know and once we know that early detection, we can treat it and we can save lives because there's somebody's grandson that needs his grandfather or grandmother or mother.Right. And it's absolutely critical that we make this is the part of our everyday awareness. I thank you, Nancy. And I used to be the Hep C connection. So thank you all for carrying this. It's been an honor to carry this for you.This is my last time I'm carrying this proclamation. And I and with the same amount of energy that I carried the first time around, I'm going to ask people to please get tested. Please educate others about hep C and other viral infections like this.With that, I know that on. Let me see. May 19th. Are we in the web? Sorry. May 17th. C testing is going to take place free.

Madam Secretary, please. Because voting announced results 1111.Nice.11 Proclamation 473 has been adopted. Councilman Lopez. Is there somebody you'd like to bring up to accept the proclamation?Yes. None other than Miss Nancy Steinfurth, if you want to come up.Thank you, everyone, for your support of the resolution tonight. And thank you especially to Councilman Lopez, who's been our champion for many years. We're going to miss you. I would like to encourage everyone to join us at our event on May 17th.So because the Web building isn't open on Sunday, we're a Sunday. We're doing this event on Friday from 830 to 330. We're offering free testing for hepatitis C to anyone who's interested. So members of the public, people who work in the building, audience members, anyone who's watching television.We would love to have you come down and get tested. It's free. It is a simple, simple finger prick. We give results in 20 minutes and then we provide information on what the next steps are in the process.Because like a lot of viruses, this isn't a one step and you're done. You then have to have other testing. One of the great achievements of the medical field is that there is now a cure. There's actually a few cures for hepatitis C.It is in as short a timeframe as eight weeks with one pill a day and no side effects. And so that's a remarkable thing to be able to say. We can cure this, we can eradicate it, but you can't do it until everyone is tested.You had a risk factor. Some of those risk factors are getting a tattoo in an unsafe setting. People don't think about that that often. But if you are sharing works because you're doing it in a basement, well, that's kind of risky.So that is one of the criteria. World War. In addition to World War Two veterans, Vietnam veterans, about 10% of them have hepatitis C, and that's because they hadn't even identified the disease until 1989. And so anyone who had a blood transfusion, plasma transfusion in the field, trans transfusion, MASH unit care, that was a risk factor.And so that represents 10%. Over the last couple of years, the VA has treated 100,000 veterans for their hepatitis C infection, and they are committed to treating everyone who is a veteran. And so that's a great opportunity. In Colorado, the Department of Corrections is also treating everyone in the Department of Corrections that has hepatitis C.Unfortunately, it was as a result of a lawsuit. But hey, we'll take a win wherever we can get it. Colorado Department of Corrections will also treat everyone. And so all of these great opportunities are coming together and we hope everyone in the audience takes advantage of it.If you can't make it to the web building, we're also testing at Pride Fest, which is in June and then will be testing at Skyline Park on Friday, July 26. So it's not the 28th, but we figured the largest number of people would be there.We could get people walking up and down the mall, people out for lunch, break, etc.. And that's thanks to Councilwoman Ortega. So thank you very much for sponsoring that. I appreciate all of your support over the years. And thank you again.Thank you. All right. That concludes our proclamations this evening. We're moving on to bills for introduction. Madam Secretary, will you please read the bills for introduction.\nSummary:", "answer": "A proclamation recognizing May 19th as “Hepatitis Testing Day” and July 28th as “World Hepatitis Day”."}, {"prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nItem ten is a communication from Councilman Austin.
