Do the squirrels select sunflower seeds or walnuts more often?\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nExperiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.\nImagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?\nFirst, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.\nNext, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.\nSo, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nCompare the motion of three bicycles.

Ff\nB. red fruit\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene.

The chemical formula for hydrogen peroxide is H2O2.\n\nChoices:\nA. an elementary substance\nB. a compound\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nEvery substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.\nThe symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.\nThe symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.You can tell whether hydrogen peroxide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for hydrogen peroxide is H2 O2. This formula contains two symbols: H for hydrogen and O for oxygen. So, the formula tells you that hydrogen peroxide is made of two chemical elements bonded together.\nSubstances made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, hydrogen peroxide is a compound."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich figure of speech is used in this text?\nAfter Cara cooked and served a scrumptious dinner, Dad boasted that she is the Julia Child of our family.\n\nChoices:\nA. allusion\nB. simile\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nFigures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait.

In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele A is for a spotted coat, and the allele a is for a black coat.\nTora, a leopard from this group, has a black coat. Tora has two alleles for a black coat.\n\nChoices:\nA. aa\nB. a black coat\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Tora's observable version of the coat pattern trait is a black coat.

The chemical formula for sodium chloride is NaCl.\n\nChoices:\nA. an elementary substance\nB. a compound\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nThere are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nThe atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.\nThe atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether sodium chloride is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for sodium chloride, NaCl, contains two atomic symbols: Na for sodium and Cl for chlorine. So, the formula tells you that sodium chloride is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.\nSince sodium chloride is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, sodium chloride is a compound."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich is a compound sentence?\n\nChoices:\nA.

To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.\nFree verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.\nThe old bridge has a wrinkled face.\nHe bends his back\nFor us to go over.\n—From Hilda Conkling, \"The Old Bridge\"\nThe syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.\nRepetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.\nThe dainty flying squirrel\nIn vest of shining white,\nIn coat of silver gray,\nAnd vest of shining white.\n—Adapted from Mary E. Burt, \"The Flying Squirrel\"\nAlliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.\nWhere the wild men watched and waited\nWolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.\n—From Bayard Taylor, \"A Night with a Wolf\"\nOnomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.\nSometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:\nTlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.\n—From Alfred Noyes, \"The Highwayman\"\nSometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:\nHark! the honey bee is humming.\n—From Mary Howitt, \"The Voice of Spring\"This poem uses end rhyme.

Both are chemical changes.\nB. Both are caused by cooling.\nC. Both are caused by heating.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nWater evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.\nMelting glass is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The glass changes from solid to liquid. But a different type of matter is not formed.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nBoth changes are caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich is a sentence fragment?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The chemical formula for potassium hydroxide is KOH.\n\nChoices:\nA. a compound\nB. an elementary substance\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nThere are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nThe atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.\nThe atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether potassium hydroxide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for potassium hydroxide, KOH, contains three atomic symbols: K for potassium, O for oxygen, and H for hydrogen. So, the formula tells you that potassium hydroxide is composed of three chemical elements bonded together.\nSince potassium hydroxide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, potassium hydroxide is a compound."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nHow long is a soccer field?\n\nHint:\nSelect the best estimate.\n\nChoices:\nA. 370 miles\nB. 370 yards\nC. 370 feet\nD. 370 inches\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nMeasurements are written with both a number and a unit.

It is moving at a higher speed.Look at the distance each sailboat moved and the time it took to move that distance.\nOne sailboat moved 100 miles in 10 hours.\nThe other sailboat moved 50 miles in 10 hours.\nNotice that each sailboat spent the same amount of time moving. The sailboat that moved 100 miles moved a farther distance in that time. So, that sailboat must have moved at a higher speed."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich is softer?\n\nChoices:\nA. cotton towel\nB. wood ruler\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nEvery object is made of one or more materials.
