In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).\nSage is a horse from this group. Sage has the homozygous genotype ll for the coat color gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. a black coat\nB. a reddish-brown coat\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Sage's genotype for the coat color gene is ll. Sage's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for a reddish-brown coat. So, Sage's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a reddish-brown coat.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Sage's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.\nSage's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Sage's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a reddish-brown coat."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nComplete the sentence so that it uses personification.\nThe wind () dispersed the leaves that Evan had spent so long raking.\n\nChoices:\nA. lightly\nB. carelessly\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nPersonification is giving human characteristics to nonhuman things.

Both are chemical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nSawing a log in half is a physical change. The log splits into two pieces. But the pieces are still made of the same type of matter.\nStretching a rubber band is a physical change. The rubber band gets longer.

The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.Snowflakes forming in a cloud is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Liquid water freezes and becomes solid, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nHow long is an ice skate?\n\nHint:\nSelect the best estimate.\n\nChoices:\nA. 34 centimeters\nB. 34 kilometers\nC. 34 meters\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nMeasurements are written with both a number and a unit.

Digby has two alleles for short fur.\n\nChoices:\nA. short fur\nB. FF\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene.

In this group, the gene for the stem height trait has two alleles. The allele H is for a tall stem, and the allele h is for a short stem.\nA certain pea plant from this group has a tall stem. This plant has two alleles for a tall stem.\n\nChoices:\nA. HH\nB. a tall stem\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. The pea plant has two alleles for a tall stem (H). So, the plant's genotype for the stem height gene is HH."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat do these two changes have in common?\nmaking paper from wood\nroasting a marshmallow over a campfire\n\nChoices:\nA. Both are only physical changes.\nB. Both are chemical changes.\nC. Both are caused by cooling.\nD. Both are caused by heating.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nMaking paper from wood is a chemical change. Paper is made by mixing tiny pieces of wood with special chemicals. The wood reacts with the chemicals to form pulp. Wood and pulp are different types of matter.\nRoasting a marshmallow is a chemical change. The type of matter on the outside of the marshmallow changes. As a marshmallow is roasted, it turns brown and crispy.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nRoasting is caused by heating.

The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.\n | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand\nSupply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up\nSupply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down\nProducers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.The population of Richmond fell by 8,000 people. Many of the people who have left are probably trying to sell their houses. Since more people are trying to sell their houses, the number of suppliers of houses for sale in Richmond has gone up. So, the supply of houses for sale probably went up, too."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich word does not rhyme?\n\nChoices:\nA. fake\nB. lake\nC. bike\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nRhyming words are words that end with the same sound.\nThe words tip and slip rhyme.

Cleo has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur color gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. light fur\nB. dark fur\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Cleo's genotype for the fur color gene is ff. Cleo's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for light fur. So, Cleo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be light fur.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Cleo's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for light fur (f) is recessive to the allele for dark fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nCleo's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Cleo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be light fur."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nIs this a run-on sentence?\nIn the early 1960s, Alan and Doris Litman, a couple in Pittsburgh, invented mace (a nontoxic tear gas), after one of Doris's colleagues was mugged, the Litmans wanted to create a safe product that women could use in self-defense.\n\nChoices:\nA. yes\nB. no\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nA sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought.\nThe band I'm in has been rehearsing daily because we have a concert in two weeks.\nA run-on sentence is formed when two sentences are run together, joined by just a comma or by no punctuation at all.

A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. Air is a gas.A baseball is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. If you hit a baseball with a bat, the baseball will still have a size and shape of its own.\nThe air from a hair dryer is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. A hair dryer uses a fan to blow warm air out. When the air leaves the hair dryer, the air expands to fill a much large space.\nThe water in a waterfall is a liquid. A liquid can change shape. But it still takes up the same amount of space. As water flows down a waterfall, the water changes shape.\nA chair is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. When you sit on a chair, it keeps its shape."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nComplete the statement.

So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.\nThe amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.\nIf the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.\nWhen an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...\nincreases | increases\ndecreases | decreases\nstays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between the sled and the center of Earth changed.\nThe bottom of the hill was lower than the point where Rita started sledding.

In this group, the gene for the body size trait has two alleles. The allele for a normal-sized body (B) is dominant over the allele for a dwarf body (b).\nNibbles is a rat from this group. Nibbles has the homozygous genotype BB for the body size gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. a normal-sized body\nB. a dwarf body\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Nibbles's genotype for the body size gene is BB. Nibbles's genotype of BB has only B allelles. The B allele is for a normal-sized body. So, Nibbles's phenotype for the body size trait must be a normal-sized body.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Nibbles's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a normal-sized body (B) is dominant over the allele for a dwarf body (b). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.\nNibbles's genotype of BB has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Nibbles's phenotype for the body size trait must be a normal-sized body."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nSuppose Hazel decides to watch the action movie.

Both are caused by cooling.\nB. Both are chemical changes.\nC. Both are only physical changes.\nD. Both are caused by heating.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nA puddle freezing into ice on a cold night is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Liquid water freezes and becomes solid, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed.\nBeating an egg is a physical change. Beating an egg mixes together the egg white, egg yolk, and some air. But mixing them together does not form a different type of matter.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nNeither change is caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nA puddle freezing is caused by cooling.

Golgi\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nPlant cells are made up of many different parts. Each cell part has a function that helps the cell survive and grow.\nSome cell parts are called organelles. Organelles are cell structures that are surrounded by their own membranes. Here are some of the organelles in plant cells:\nChloroplasts and mitochondria work together to help the cell get the energy it needs. The chloroplasts use photosynthesis to make sugar. The mitochondria break down this sugar and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.\nThe nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.\nThe endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.\nAfter proteins are made in the endoplasmic reticulum, they can be transferred to the Golgi. The Golgi is an organelle made up of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances. Then, the Golgi sends these substances to different parts of the cell. Some of these substances are sent to the cell membrane and released from the cell.\nIn plant cells, the vacuole stores waste, water, and nutrients such as sugar. Most plant cells have one vacuole.\nOther cell parts are not surrounded by their own membranes. These cell parts are not organelles.\nThe cell wall is the cell's tough outer covering. It gives the cell strength and stiffness and helps the cell keep its shape.\nOn the inside of the cell wall is a thin layer called the cell membrane. This layer is a membrane, but it does not have a membrane surrounding it, so it is not an organelle. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell.\nThe cytoplasm is a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell. The cytoplasm also helps the cell keep its shape and supports the other cell parts.Chromosomes contain the information that the cell uses for growth and activities. This information helps control what the cell does and how it grows and develops.\nIn plant and animal cells, the chromosomes are inside the nucleus."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich is the most flexible?\n\nChoices:\nA. rubber gloves\nB. glass window\nC. rock\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nEvery object is made of one or more materials.

Atoms are always moving.\nThe energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.\nTemperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.\nWhat happens if the amount of matter changes? A 1-kilogram brick at 70°F has half as much thermal energy as a 2-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the smaller brick has half as many atoms. So, it has half as much thermal energy.The two blocks of concrete are made of the same material and have the same mass.

Both are caused by heating.\nB. Both are chemical changes.\nC. Both are only physical changes.\nD. Both are caused by cooling.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nSnails growing shells is a chemical change. A snail's body uses calcium from its food to make a new molecule called calcium carbonate. This calcium carbonate is used to grow the shell.\nPhotosynthesis is a chemical change. Plants make sugar using carbon dioxide, water, and energy from sunlight.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes.

Both are caused by cooling.\nB. Both are only physical changes.\nC. Both are chemical changes.\nD. Both are caused by heating.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nA tarnished silver spoon is one that has become less shiny over time. Polishing the spoon makes it look shiny again.\nThe polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. So, using polish to remove tarnish from silver is a chemical change.\nA piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change. The avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter.\nIf you scrape off the brown part of the avocado, the inside will still be green. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the avocado.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nNeither change is caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWould you find the word bright on a dictionary page with the following guide words?\nbelieve - burrow\n\nChoices:\nA. yes\nB. no\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nGuide words appear on each page of a dictionary.

The chemical formula for potassium chloride is KCl.\n\nChoices:\nA. a compound\nB. an elementary substance\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nThere are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nThe atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.\nThe atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether potassium chloride is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for potassium chloride, KCl, contains two atomic symbols: K for potassium and Cl for chlorine. So, the formula tells you that potassium chloride is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.\nSince potassium chloride is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, potassium chloride is a compound."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich is a complex sentence?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nIce melting in a cup is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The solid ice becomes liquid, but it is still made of water.\nThe links between atoms in the water molecules do not change. So, a different type of matter is not formed.\nDew appearing on grass in the morning is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Water vapor in the air touches the cool grass and becomes liquid.\nThe water vapor changes state to become dew, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nIce melting is caused by heating. But dew appearing on grass is not.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nDew appears when water vapor in the air condenses into a liquid on the grass. This is caused by cooling.

Both are only physical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "D\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules.

One unit used to measure time is the hour.\nThink about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed.Look at the distance each blue whale moved and the time it took to move that distance.\nOne blue whale moved 40 miles in 5 hours.\nThe other blue whale moved 55 miles in 5 hours.\nNotice that each blue whale spent the same amount of time moving. The blue whale that moved 40 miles moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that blue whale must have moved at a lower speed."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nIs the following trait inherited or acquired?\nAnna has naturally red hair.\n\nHint:\nHint: Some people dye their hair.

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nBurning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.Leaves changing color is a chemical change. Leaves contain a chemical called chlorophyll that makes them green.

Both are only physical changes.\nB. Both are chemical changes.\nC. Both are caused by heating.\nD. Both are caused by cooling.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nWater evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.\nRain forming in a cloud is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Water vapor in the air condenses into tiny droplets of liquid water. These droplets make up a cloud. When there is enough water in the air, the droplets will fall as rain.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nWater evaporating is caused by heating. But rain forming in a cloud is not.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nRain begins to form when water vapor in the air becomes liquid water. This is caused by cooling.

A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Hari's genotype for the coat pattern gene is aa. Hari's genotype of aa has only a alleles. The a allele is for a spotted coat. So, Hari's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Hari's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a spotted coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.\nHari's genotype of aa has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait.

In this group, the gene for the fur type trait has two alleles. The allele for curly fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F).\nPrecious is a cat from this group. Precious has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur type gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. straight fur\nB. curly fur\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Precious's genotype for the fur type gene is FF. Precious's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for straight fur. So, Precious's phenotype for the fur type trait must be straight fur.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Precious's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for curly fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nPrecious's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Precious's phenotype for the fur type trait must be straight fur."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich figure of speech is used in this text?\nI must have eaten too much of Bernard's homemade chili, because now I'm so full I could explode!\n\nChoices:\nA. hyperbole\nB. oxymoron\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nFigures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way.

Which potato has more thermal energy?\n\nHint:\nThe objects are made of the same type of matter.\n\nChoices:\nA. the baked potato with more mass\nB. the baked potato with less mass\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nMatter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.\nThe energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.\nTemperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.\nWhat happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two baked potatoes have the same temperature and are made of the same type of matter.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nCompost forms from the remains of plants and animals, such as vegetable scraps and egg shells. Compost rotting is a chemical change. As the compost rots, it breaks down and turns into a different type of matter.\nA piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.\nIf you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change didn't happen to that part of the apple.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nNeither change is caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich closing is correct for a letter?\n\nChoices:\nA. thanks,\nTrudy\nB.

In this group, the gene for the whisker type trait has two alleles. The allele for curved whiskers (h) is recessive to the allele for straight whiskers (H).\nKiki is a Syrian hamster from this group. Kiki has the heterozygous genotype Hh for the whisker type gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. straight whiskers\nB. curved whiskers\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Kiki's phenotype for the whisker type trait. First, consider the alleles in Kiki's genotype for the whisker type gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for curved whiskers (h) is recessive to the allele for straight whiskers (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.\nKiki's genotype of Hh has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Kiki's phenotype for the whisker type trait must be straight whiskers."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat do these two changes have in common?\na banana getting ripe on the counter\nsaliva breaking down a piece of bread\n\nChoices:\nA. Both are caused by cooling.\nB. Both are caused by heating.\nC. Both are only physical changes.\nD. Both are chemical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "D\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nA banana getting ripe on the counter is a chemical change. As a banana ripens, the type of matter in it changes. The peel changes color and the inside becomes softer and sweeter.\nSaliva breaking down a piece of bread is a chemical change. Bread is made up mostly of a chemical called starch. Saliva breaks the bonds between atoms in the starch molecules.\nThe atoms then link together to form smaller, simpler molecules of sugar. The sugar is a different type of matter than the starch.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nNeither change is caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich greeting is correct for a letter?\n\nChoices:\nA.

First, consider the alleles in Chirpie's genotype for the body feather color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for blue body feathers (b) is recessive to the allele for green body feathers (B). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.\nChirpie's genotype of Bb has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Chirpie's phenotype for the body feather color trait must be green body feathers."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich logical fallacy is used in the text?\nMost students who take the school's Advanced Computer Science class go on to major in computer science.

The chemical formula for phosphorus tribromide is PBr3.\n\nChoices:\nA. a compound\nB. an elementary substance\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nThere are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nThe atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.\nThe atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether phosphorus tribromide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for phosphorus tribromide, PBr3, contains two atomic symbols: P for phosphorus and Br for bromine. So, the formula tells you that phosphorus tribromide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.\nSince phosphorus tribromide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, phosphorus tribromide is a compound."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat information supports the conclusion that Shelby acquired this trait?\n\nHint:\nRead the description of a trait.\nShelby knows a lot about biology.\n\nChoices:\nA.

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling.

This plant has two alleles for sour fruit.\n\nChoices:\nA. sour fruit\nB. FF\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait.

So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nBaking a loaf of bread is a chemical change. The type of matter in the dough changes when it is baked. The dough turns into bread!\nMelting glass is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The glass changes from solid to liquid. But a different type of matter is not formed.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nMelting glass is a physical change. But baking bread is not.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBaking bread is a chemical change. But melting glass is not.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nBoth changes are caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nIs the following trait inherited or acquired?\nBrian plays basketball.\n\nHint:\nHint: Playing basketball takes practice.\n\nChoices:\nA. acquired\nB. inherited\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nOrganisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits.

When hung in the laundry room, do black cloth towels or white cloth towels dry more quickly?\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nExperiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.\nImagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?\nFirst, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.\nNext, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.\nSo, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich is a compound sentence?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.\nInherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.\nAcquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment.

Both are chemical changes.\nB. Both are caused by heating.\nC. Both are caused by cooling.\nD. Both are only physical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "D\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nMixing sand and water is a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet. But both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before.\nLoose matter such as sand and dirt is called sediment. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change.\nThe sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. This separates the water from the sediment. But separating a mixture does not form a different type of matter.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nNeither change is caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nComplete the statement.

Both are caused by cooling.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nA slice of banana turning brown is a chemical change. The part of the banana in contact with the air reacts with oxygen and turns into a different type of matter.\nCooking chicken is a chemical change.

When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.\nImagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?\nFirst, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.\nNext, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.\nSo, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich is a complete sentence?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.\nInherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.\nAcquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment.

Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. Air is a gas.The water in a fishbowl is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in.

Atoms are always moving.\nThe energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.\nTemperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.\nWhat happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two bricks are made of the same material and have the same mass.

A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Ace's phenotype for the coat color trait. First, consider the alleles in Ace's genotype for the coat color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.\nAce's genotype of Ll has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Ace's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat information supports the conclusion that Fernando acquired this trait?\n\nHint:\nRead the description of a trait.\nFernando knows a lot about history.\n\nChoices:\nA.

Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.\nThe symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.\nThe symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for bromomethane contains three symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, and Br for bromine. So, bromomethane is made of three chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, bromomethane is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for rhenium contains one symbol: Re. So, rhenium is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, rhenium is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for hydrogen peroxide contains two symbols: H for hydrogen and O for oxygen. So, hydrogen peroxide is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.

Atoms are always moving.\nThe energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.\nTemperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.\nWhat happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nBreaking a plate is a physical change.

Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait.

Both are caused by cooling.\nB. Both are only physical changes.\nC. Both are chemical changes.\nD. Both are caused by heating.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nA piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change. The avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter.\nIf you scrape off the brown part of the avocado, the inside will still be green. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the avocado.\nBoiling sugar to make caramel is a chemical change. The heat causes the sugar to change into a different type of matter. Unlike sugar, the new matter is brown and sticky.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nBoiling sugar is caused by heating. But a piece of avocado turning brown is not.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.\nThe symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.\nThe symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.You can tell whether argon is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for argon is Ar. This formula contains one symbol: Ar.

In this group, the gene for the iridescent scales trait has two alleles. The allele for mostly iridescent scales (I) is dominant over the allele for mostly plain scales (i).\nPoseidon is a betta from this group. Poseidon has the homozygous genotype ii for the iridescent scales gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. mostly plain scales\nB. mostly iridescent scales\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Poseidon's genotype for the iridescent scales gene is ii. Poseidon's genotype of ii has only i alleles. The i allele is for mostly plain scales. So, Poseidon's phenotype for the iridescent scales trait must be mostly plain scales.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Poseidon's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for mostly iridescent scales (I) is dominant over the allele for mostly plain scales (i). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.\nPoseidon's genotype of ii has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Poseidon's phenotype for the iridescent scales trait must be mostly plain scales."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich word would you find on a dictionary page with the following guide words?\npad - poison\n\nChoices:\nA. president\nB. peach\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nGuide words appear on each page of a dictionary.

Both are only physical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "D\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nLoose matter such as sand and dirt is called sediment. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change.\nThe sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. This separates the water from the sediment. But separating a mixture does not form a different type of matter.\nDry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation.\nDry ice becoming a gas is a physical change. A change of state does not form a different type of matter.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nDry ice sublimating is caused by heating.

When placed in the sun, will eight ounces of water in a glass jar or eight ounces of water in a plastic cup get warmer?\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nExperiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.\nImagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?\nFirst, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.\nNext, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.\nSo, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich word does not rhyme?\n\nChoices:\nA. wife\nB. swim\nC. life\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nRhyming words are words that end with the same sound.\nThe words tip and slip rhyme.

In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N).\nA certain fruit fly from this group has the heterozygous genotype Nn for the wing type gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. normal wings\nB. vestigial wings\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine the fruit fly's phenotype for the wing type trait. First, consider the alleles in the fly's genotype for the wing type gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N). This means N is a dominant allele, and n is a recessive allele.\nThe fruit fly's genotype of Nn has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the fruit fly's phenotype for the wing type trait must be normal wings."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nCompare the motion of two runners.

Both are caused by heating.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nMetal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.\nA dinosaur bone turning into rock is a chemical change. The matter that made up the bone when it was alive begins to break down. Over a long time, a different type of matter starts forming inside small gaps in the bone. The matter is made of minerals from the earth.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes.

In this group, the gene for the agouti fur trait has two alleles. The allele for having agouti fur (A) is dominant over the allele for not having agouti fur (a).\nNabi is a cat from this group. Nabi has the homozygous genotype AA for the agouti fur gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. not having agouti fur\nB. having agouti fur\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Nabi's genotype for the agouti fur gene is AA. Nabi's genotype of AA has only A allelles. The A allele is for having agouti fur. So, Nabi's phenotype for the agouti fur trait must be having agouti fur.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Nabi's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having agouti fur (A) is dominant over the allele for not having agouti fur (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.\nNabi's genotype of AA has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Nabi's phenotype for the agouti fur trait must be having agouti fur."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the volume of a kiddie pool?\n\nHint:\nSelect the better estimate.\n\nChoices:\nA. 1,080 liters\nB. 1,080 milliliters\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nMeasurements are written with both a number and a unit.

The chemical formula for potassium hydroxide is KOH.\n\nChoices:\nA. a compound\nB. an elementary substance\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nThere are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nThe atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.\nThe atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether potassium hydroxide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for potassium hydroxide, KOH, contains three atomic symbols: K for potassium, O for oxygen, and H for hydrogen. So, the formula tells you that potassium hydroxide is composed of three chemical elements bonded together.\nSince potassium hydroxide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, potassium hydroxide is a compound."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the source of the allusion in the sentence below?\nMost of the people who knew Harold considered him to be an unrepentant Casanova.\n\nChoices:\nA. history\nB.

So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.\nThe amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.\nIf the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change.

The chemical formula for sodium chloride is NaCl.\n\nChoices:\nA. an elementary substance\nB. a compound\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nThere are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nThe atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.\nThe atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether sodium chloride is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for sodium chloride, NaCl, contains two atomic symbols: Na for sodium and Cl for chlorine. So, the formula tells you that sodium chloride is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.\nSince sodium chloride is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, sodium chloride is a compound."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat kind of sentence is this?\nWhat is the likelihood that we will encounter bears and other wildlife in Alaska?\n\nChoices:\nA. imperative\nB. declarative\nC. interrogative\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nThere are four kinds of sentences.\nA declarative sentence is a statement and always ends with a period.\nThe nurse told Mr. Abrams to roll up his sleeve so that she could check his blood pressure.\nAn imperative sentence makes a request or a demand and usually ends with a period.

Both are chemical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nDry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation.\nDry ice becoming a gas is a physical change.

Both are caused by cooling.\nB. Both are chemical changes.\nC. Both are only physical changes.\nD. Both are caused by heating.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating.

So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nBreaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.\nWater vapor condensing on a bathroom mirror is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The water changes state from gas in the air to liquid water on the mirror. But the water vapor and the liquid water are both made of water.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nNeither change is caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nWater vapor condensing is caused by cooling.

In this group, the gene for the body hair trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy body (B) is dominant over the allele for a hairless body (b).\nSkippy is a deer mouse from this group. Skippy has the homozygous genotype bb for the body hair gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. a hairy body\nB. a hairless body\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Skippy's genotype for the body hair gene is bb. Skippy's genotype of bb has only b alleles. The b allele is for a hairless body. So, Skippy's phenotype for the body hair trait must be a hairless body.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Skippy's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a hairy body (B) is dominant over the allele for a hairless body (b). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.\nSkippy's genotype of bb has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Skippy's phenotype for the body hair trait must be a hairless body."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nBased on this information, what is Flopsy's phenotype for the fur length trait?\n\nHint:\nIn a group of Syrian hamsters, some individuals have short fur and others have long fur.

In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F).\nRingo is a rabbit from this group. Ringo has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur color gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. black fur\nB. brown fur\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Ringo's genotype for the fur color gene is ff. Ringo's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for brown fur. So, Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be brown fur.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Ringo's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nRingo's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be brown fur."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nSelect the action that doesn't belong.\n\nChoices:\nA. chop\nB. blend\nC. stir\nD. mix\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nChop doesn't belong.\nBlend, mix, and stir all describe ways to combine things."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nIs a banana a good or a service?\n\nChoices:\nA. a service\nB. a good\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nEverything you can buy is either a good or a service.\nA good is something you can touch or hold in your hands.

In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for dark fur (F) is dominant over the allele for light fur (f).\nRingo is a rock pocket mouse from this group. Ringo has the heterozygous genotype Ff for the fur color gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. light fur\nB. dark fur\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait. First, consider the alleles in Ringo's genotype for the fur color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for dark fur (F) is dominant over the allele for light fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nRingo's genotype of Ff has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be dark fur."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat information supports the conclusion that Trisha acquired this trait?\n\nHint:\nRead the description of a trait.\nTrisha knows how to make chili.\n\nChoices:\nA.

A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Pepe's genotype for the ear type gene is EE. Pepe's genotype of EE has only E allelles. The E allele is for normal ears. So, Pepe's phenotype for the ear type trait must be normal ears.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Pepe's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for dumbo ears (e) is recessive to the allele for normal ears (E). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.\nPepe's genotype of EE has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Pepe's phenotype for the ear type trait must be normal ears."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich object has the most thermal energy?\n\nHint:\nThe objects are identical except for their temperatures.\n\nChoices:\nA. a crayon at a temperature of 15°C\nB. a crayon at a temperature of 11°C\nC. a crayon at a temperature of 8°C\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter.

LL\nB. white legs\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.

In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H).\nSkip is a cow from this group. Skip has the heterozygous genotype Hh for the horns gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. not having horns\nB. having horns\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Skip's phenotype for the horns trait. First, consider the alleles in Skip's genotype for the horns gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.\nSkip's genotype of Hh has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Skip's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat information supports the conclusion that Tara acquired this trait?\n\nHint:\nRead the description of a trait.\nTara knows how to grow sunflowers.\n\nChoices:\nA.

Both are caused by heating.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nBleaching clothes is a chemical change. The bleach reacts with dark stains on the clothes. The reaction changes the stains into different types of matter that wash away easily.\nA piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.\nIf you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change didn't happen to that part of the apple.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nNeither change is caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWould you find the word jeep on a dictionary page with the following guide words?\njar - jut\n\nChoices:\nA. yes\nB. no\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nGuide words appear on each page of a dictionary.

So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. Air is a gas.Rain is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you put rainwater into a bucket, the rainwater will take the shape of the bucket. But the rainwater will still take up the same amount of space.\nA plate is a solid. If someone drops a plate, it may break into pieces. But each piece will still have a size and shape of its own.\nAn umbrella is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. When you open an umbrella, it still has a size and shape of its own.\nHelium is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. Helium is lighter than air. So, if you fill a balloon with helium, the balloon will rise. If helium leaks out of the balloon, the helium will expand into the space around the balloon."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich logical fallacy is used in the text?\nOur mission is to provide customers with the best snacks on the market.

In this group, the gene for the coat graying trait has two alleles. The allele for having a graying coat (G) is dominant over the allele for not having a graying coat (g).\nDolly is a horse from this group. Dolly has the homozygous genotype gg for the coat graying gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. not having a graying coat\nB. having a graying coat\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Dolly's genotype for the coat graying gene is gg. Dolly's genotype of gg has only g alleles. The g allele is for not having a graying coat. So, Dolly's phenotype for the coat graying trait must be not having a graying coat.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Dolly's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having a graying coat (G) is dominant over the allele for not having a graying coat (g). This means G is a dominant allele, and g is a recessive allele.\nDolly's genotype of gg has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Dolly's phenotype for the coat graying trait must be not having a graying coat."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nIs the following trait inherited or acquired?\nAaron can ride a motorcycle.\n\nHint:\nHint: Riding a motorcycle well takes practice.\n\nChoices:\nA. acquired\nB. inherited\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nOrganisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits.

Both are chemical changes.\nB. Both are only physical changes.\nC. Both are caused by heating.\nD. Both are caused by cooling.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nRust forming on a bike frame is a chemical change. The metal on the bike changes into rust. Metal and rust are different types of matter.\nMetal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nNeither change is caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nSelect the mixture.\n\nChoices:\nA. lemonade\nB. silver\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nA pure substance is made of only one type of matter.\nA mixture is made of two or more types of matter mixed together."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nBased on this information, what is this fish's phenotype for the body color trait?\n\nHint:\nIn a group of Nile tilapia fish, some individuals have a greenish-brown body and others have a pink body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a pink body (b) is recessive to the allele for a greenish-brown body (B).\nA certain Nile tilapia fish from this group has the homozygous genotype bb for the body color gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. a greenish-brown body\nB. a pink body\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.The Nile tilapia fish's genotype for the body color gene is bb. The Nile tilapia fish's genotype of bb has only b alleles. The b allele is for a pink body. So, the Nile tilapia fish's phenotype for the body color trait must be a pink body.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the Nile tilapia fish's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a pink body (b) is recessive to the allele for a greenish-brown body (B). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.\nThe Nile tilapia fish's genotype of bb has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the Nile tilapia fish's phenotype for the body color trait must be a pink body."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the mass of a vacuum cleaner?\n\nHint:\nSelect the best estimate.\n\nChoices:\nA. 19 pounds\nB. 19 tons\nC. 19 ounces\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nMeasurements are written with both a number and a unit.

Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.\nThe symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.\nThe symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for water contains two symbols: H for hydrogen and O for oxygen. So, water is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, water is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for zinc contains one symbol: Zn. So, zinc is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, zinc is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for methane contains two symbols: C for carbon and H for hydrogen. So, methane is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, methane is a compound, not an elementary substance."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich word would you find on a dictionary page with the following guide words?\nplus - prospect\n\nChoices:\nA. pest\nB. pot\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nGuide words appear on each page of a dictionary.

Both are only physical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "D\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nBreaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.\nMixing chocolate syrup into milk is a physical change. The chocolate syrup and milk make a mixture. Making a mixture does not form a different type of matter.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes.

Atoms are always moving.\nThe energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.\nTemperature measures how hot or cold matter is.

Both are caused by heating.\nB. Both are chemical changes.\nC. Both are only physical changes.\nD. Both are caused by cooling.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nMixing sand and water is a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet. But both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before.\nCarving a piece of wood is a physical change. The wood changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nNeither change is caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nBased on this information, what is Basil's phenotype for the eye color trait?\n\nHint:\nIn a group of guinea pigs, some individuals have brown eyes and others have red eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele for brown eyes (E) is dominant over the allele for red eyes (e).\nBasil is a guinea pig from this group. Basil has the homozygous genotype ee for the eye color gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. brown eyes\nB. red eyes\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Basil's genotype for the eye color gene is ee. Basil's genotype of ee has only e alleles. The e allele is for red eyes. So, Basil's phenotype for the eye color trait must be red eyes.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Basil's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for brown eyes (E) is dominant over the allele for red eyes (e). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.\nBasil's genotype of ee has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Basil's phenotype for the eye color trait must be red eyes."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich greeting is correct for a letter?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Both are chemical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "D\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nBaking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes when it is baked. The crust turns brown, and the apples become soft.\nA tarnished silver spoon is one that has become less shiny over time. Polishing the spoon makes it look shiny again.\nThe polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. So, using polish to remove tarnish from silver is a chemical change.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nBaking is caused by heating.

The chemical formula for gallium arsenide is GaAs.\n\nChoices:\nA. a compound\nB. an elementary substance\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nThere are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nThe atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.\nThe atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether gallium arsenide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for gallium arsenide, GaAs, contains two atomic symbols: Ga for gallium and As for arsenic. So, the formula tells you that gallium arsenide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.\nSince gallium arsenide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, gallium arsenide is a compound."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the volume of a watering can?\n\nHint:\nSelect the best estimate.\n\nChoices:\nA. 24 cups\nB. 24 fluid ounces\nC. 24 gallons\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nMeasurements are written with both a number and a unit.

In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G).\nA certain rose plant from this group has the homozygous genotype gg for the growth pattern gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. bush growth\nB. climbing growth\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.The rose plant's genotype for the growth pattern gene is gg. The rose plant's genotype of gg has only g alleles. The g allele is for bush growth. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the growth pattern trait must be bush growth.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the rose plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G). This means G is a dominant allele, and g is a recessive allele.\nThe rose plant's genotype of gg has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the growth pattern trait must be bush growth."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nDoes this passage describe the weather or the climate?\nThere are usually more days with low air pressure than high air pressure where Martha lives.\n\nChoices:\nA. weather\nB. climate\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nThe atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds Earth.

In this group, the gene for the Thomsen disease trait has two alleles. The allele for having Thomsen disease (M) is dominant over the allele for not having Thomsen disease (m).\nElijah is a human from this group. Elijah has the homozygous genotype mm for the Thomsen disease gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. having Thomsen disease\nB. not having Thomsen disease\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Elijah's genotype for the Thomsen disease gene is mm. Elijah's genotype of mm has only m alleles. The m allele is for not having Thomsen disease. So, Elijah's phenotype for the Thomsen disease trait must be not having Thomsen disease.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Elijah's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having Thomsen disease (M) is dominant over the allele for not having Thomsen disease (m). This means M is a dominant allele, and m is a recessive allele.\nElijah's genotype of mm has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Elijah's phenotype for the Thomsen disease trait must be not having Thomsen disease."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nComplete the sentence.\nWater freezing into ice is a ().\n\nChoices:\nA. chemical change\nB. physical change\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nChemical changes and physical changes are two ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes.\nBurning a piece of paper is a chemical change.

In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele for curled ears (E) is dominant over the allele for straight ears (e).\nDutchess is an American curl cat from this group. Dutchess has the heterozygous genotype Ee for the ear type gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. curled ears\nB. straight ears\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Dutchess's phenotype for the ear type trait. First, consider the alleles in Dutchess's genotype for the ear type gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for curled ears (E) is dominant over the allele for straight ears (e). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.\nDutchess's genotype of Ee has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Dutchess's phenotype for the ear type trait must be curled ears."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich figure of speech is used in this text?\nValeria's phone slipped out of her pocket, landing in the toilet with a plop.\n\nChoices:\nA. onomatopoeia\nB. verbal irony\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nFigures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way.

Minnie has two alleles for straight whiskers.\n\nChoices:\nA. HH\nB. straight whiskers\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Minnie's observable version of the whisker type trait is straight whiskers.

The chemical formula for cyclooctasulfur is S8.\n\nChoices:\nA. a compound\nB. an elementary substance\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nThere are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nThe atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.\nThe atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether cyclooctasulfur is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for cyclooctasulfur, S8, contains one atomic symbol: S for sulfur. So, the formula tells you that cyclooctasulfur is composed of only one chemical element.\nSince cyclooctasulfur is composed of only one chemical element, cyclooctasulfur is an elementary substance."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the volume of a fish bowl?\n\nHint:\nSelect the better estimate.\n\nChoices:\nA. 3 liters\nB. 3 milliliters\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nMeasurements are written with both a number and a unit.

Thousands of Americans and Vietnamese had died in the war, giving rise to a growing anti-war movement. President Johnson, a Democrat, declined to run for reelection, in part because of the heavy opposition to his conduct of the war. Just months before the convention, both Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were assassinated, contributing to widespread unrest. Anti-war protesters wanted the Democratic Party to oppose the war, but they were excluded from the convention. This set off violent clashes between police and protesters on Chicago streets. The violence at the convention captured the nation's attention, strengthened the peace movement, and led to reforms in the nominating process.\n\nChoices:\nA. cause-effect\nB. compare-contrast\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAuthors use different text structures to organize their ideas in writing.

A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.The summer squash plant's genotype for the leaf texture gene is ll. The summer squash plant's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for smooth leaves. So, the summer squash plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait must be smooth leaves.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the summer squash plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for smooth leaves (l) is recessive to the allele for fuzzy leaves (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.\nThe summer squash plant's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the summer squash plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait must be smooth leaves."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich logical fallacy is used in the text?\nDon't ever get a ride from Erin.

A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible.

Both are chemical changes.\nB. Both are caused by cooling.\nC. Both are only physical changes.\nD. Both are caused by heating.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nA piece of a pear turning brown is a chemical change. The substances in the pear react with oxygen in the air and turn into a different type of matter.\nIf you scrape off the brown part of the pear, the inside will still be white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the pear.\nAcid rain weathering a marble statue is a chemical change. The acid rain reacts with the outside of the statue and breaks it down into a different type of matter. This new matter is then washed away by the rain. Acid rain is a type of pollution. It forms when smoke from automobiles and factories mixes with water in clouds.\nAcid rain is a type of pollution. It forms when automobiles and factories release smoke containing sulfur or nitrogen. Some of these chemicals react with water in the atmosphere. The reaction forms droplets of water that can fall back to the ground as acid rain.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nNeither change is caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich text uses the word terribly in its traditional sense?\n\nChoices:\nA.

A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Chance's phenotype for the fur texture trait. First, consider the alleles in Chance's genotype for the fur texture gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for rough fur (F) is dominant over the allele for soft fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nChance's genotype of Ff has one dominant allele and one recessive allele.

Both are caused by cooling.\nB. Both are caused by heating.\nC. Both are only physical changes.\nD. Both are chemical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "D\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nA copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction forms a different type of matter called copper oxide. The copper oxide is green.\nFiring a clay pot in a hot kiln is a chemical change. High temperatures cause the clay to slowly harden. After several hours in the kiln, the clay will have changed into a different type of matter.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nFiring clay is caused by heating.

Both are only physical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nA piece of pizza rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the pizza breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter.\nCooking an egg is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change. Cooked eggs and raw eggs are made of different types of matter.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes.

In this group, the gene for the fruit sheen trait has two alleles. The allele for dull fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for glossy fruit (f).\nA certain cucumber plant from this group has the homozygous genotype FF for the fruit sheen gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. dull fruit\nB. glossy fruit\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.The cucumber plant's genotype for the fruit sheen gene is FF. The cucumber plant's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for dull fruit. So, the cucumber plant's phenotype for the fruit sheen trait must be dull fruit.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the cucumber plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for dull fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for glossy fruit (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nThe cucumber plant's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the cucumber plant's phenotype for the fruit sheen trait must be dull fruit."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat information supports the conclusion that Destiny acquired this trait?\n\nHint:\nRead the description of a trait.\nDestiny is good at identifying insects.\n\nChoices:\nA.

It is no longer used in airships because it catches fire easily. The chemical formula for hydrogen is H2.\n\nChoices:\nA. a compound\nB. an elementary substance\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nThere are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nThe atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.\nThe atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2.

Both are caused by heating.\nB. Both are chemical changes.\nC. Both are caused by cooling.\nD. Both are only physical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "D\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nMelting wax is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The wax changes from solid to liquid. But it is still made of the same type of matter.\nRain forming in a cloud is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Water vapor in the air condenses into tiny droplets of liquid water. These droplets make up a cloud. When there is enough water in the air, the droplets will fall as rain.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nWax melting is caused by heating. But rain forming in a cloud is not.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nRain begins to form when water vapor in the air becomes liquid water. This is caused by cooling.

Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.\nThe symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.\nThe symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom.

In this group, the gene for the whisker type trait has two alleles. The allele for curved whiskers (h) is recessive to the allele for straight whiskers (H).\nStuart is a Syrian hamster from this group. Stuart has the homozygous genotype hh for the whisker type gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. curved whiskers\nB. straight whiskers\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Stuart's genotype for the whisker type gene is hh. Stuart's genotype of hh has only h alleles. The h allele is for curved whiskers. So, Stuart's phenotype for the whisker type trait must be curved whiskers.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Stuart's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for curved whiskers (h) is recessive to the allele for straight whiskers (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.\nStuart's genotype of hh has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Stuart's phenotype for the whisker type trait must be curved whiskers."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nCompare the motion of two gray whales.

Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. Air is a gas.The air from a hair dryer is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. A hair dryer uses a fan to blow warm air out. When the air leaves the hair dryer, the air expands to fill a much large space.\nA tortoise shell is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A tortoise shell is made of a solid called keratin, just like your fingernails!\nA pair of dice is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. When you roll a pair of dice, the dice have a shape of their own. They are still cubes when they stop rolling.\nCaramel sauce is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour caramel sauce into a container, the caramel sauce will take the shape of that container. But the caramel sauce will still take up the same amount of space."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nDoes this passage describe the weather or the climate?\nThe air was muggy and humid today where Eli lives.\n\nChoices:\nA. climate\nB. weather\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nThe atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds Earth.

The chemical formula for silicon dioxide is SiO2.\n\nChoices:\nA. a compound\nB. an elementary substance\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nEvery substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.\nThe symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.\nThe symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.You can tell whether silicon dioxide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for silicon dioxide is SiO2. This formula contains two symbols: Si for silicon and O for oxygen. So, the formula tells you that silicon dioxide is made of two chemical elements bonded together.\nSubstances made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.

Both are caused by cooling.\nB. Both are caused by heating.\nC. Both are chemical changes.\nD. Both are only physical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nPhotosynthesis is a chemical change. Plants make sugar using carbon dioxide, water, and energy from sunlight.\nMetal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes.

In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a red coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).\nCheyenne is a cow from this group. Cheyenne has the homozygous genotype ll for the coat color gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. a black coat\nB. a red coat\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Cheyenne's genotype for the coat color gene is ll. Cheyenne's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for a red coat. So, Cheyenne's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a red coat.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Cheyenne's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a red coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.\nCheyenne's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Cheyenne's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a red coat."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich drop of honey has a higher temperature?\n\nHint:\nTwo drops of honey are identical except for their thermal energies.\n\nChoices:\nA. the drop of honey with less thermal energy\nB. the drop of honey with more thermal energy\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nMatter is made of tiny particles called atoms.

In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for straight fur (F) is dominant over the allele for wavy fur (f).\nBiscotti is a Syrian hamster from this group. Biscotti has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur texture gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. wavy fur\nB. straight fur\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Biscotti's genotype for the fur texture gene is ff. Biscotti's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for wavy fur. So, Biscotti's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be wavy fur.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Biscotti's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for straight fur (F) is dominant over the allele for wavy fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nBiscotti's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Biscotti's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be wavy fur."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich figure of speech is used in this text?\nI don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.

The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating.

The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nMilk going sour is a chemical change. The type of matter in the milk slowly changes. The new matter that is formed gives the milk its sour taste.\nBaking a loaf of bread is a chemical change. Bread is made from dough. Baking turns the dough into bread. The bread is a different type of matter than the dough.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nBaking is caused by heating. But milk going sour is not.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich is a complete sentence?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The allele for yellow pods (d) is recessive to the allele for green pods (D).\nA certain pea plant from this group has the homozygous genotype DD for the pod color gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. yellow pods\nB. green pods\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.The pea plant's genotype for the pod color gene is DD. The pea plant's genotype of DD has only D allelles. The D allele is for green pods. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the pod color trait must be green pods.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the pea plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for yellow pods (d) is recessive to the allele for green pods (D). This means D is a dominant allele, and d is a recessive allele.\nThe pea plant's genotype of DD has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the pod color trait must be green pods."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich is a run-on sentence?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Chip has one allele for straight fur (F) and one allele for wavy fur (f). So, Chip's genotype for the fur texture gene is Ff."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat information supports the conclusion that Judy inherited this trait?\n\nHint:\nRead the description of a trait.\nJudy has red hair.\n\nChoices:\nA.

In this group, the gene for the cheek color trait has two alleles.

Queenie has two alleles for bright orange cheeks.\n\nChoices:\nA. bright orange cheeks\nB. RR\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Queenie's observable version of the cheek color trait is bright orange cheeks. So, Queenie's phenotype for the cheek color trait is bright orange cheeks."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat does the metaphor in this text suggest?\nWhen Alvin lost his job, he was devastated.

But sometimes, disease or injury can cause damage that is too severe to heal. When a limb is too severely damaged to heal, it may need to be amputated, or removed.\nFor example, a doctor can treat an infected limb with medicine. But if the infection does not go away, it can spread to the rest of the person's body. To stop the infection from spreading, the infected limb may need to be amputated.\nIn other cases, when a limb is badly injured, the skin, bones, muscles, and nerves may be severely damaged.

When placed in the sun, will eight ounces of water in a glass jar or eight ounces of water in a plastic cup get warmer?\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nExperiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.\nImagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?\nFirst, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.\nNext, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same.

In this group, the gene for the flower color trait has two alleles. The allele for red flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (f).\nA certain scarlet rosemallow plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the flower color gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. white flowers\nB. red flowers\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype for the flower color gene is ff. The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for white flowers. So, the scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait must be white flowers.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the scarlet rosemallow plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for red flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nThe scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait must be white flowers."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich mug of cider has a lower temperature?\n\nHint:\nTwo 150-gram mugs of cider are identical except for their thermal energies.\n\nChoices:\nA. the mug of cider with less thermal energy\nB. the mug of cider with more thermal energy\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nMatter is made of tiny particles called atoms.

Golgi\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nPlant cells are made up of many different parts. Each cell part has a function that helps the cell survive and grow.\nSome cell parts are called organelles. Organelles are cell structures that are surrounded by their own membranes. Here are some of the organelles in plant cells:\nChloroplasts and mitochondria work together to help the cell get the energy it needs. The chloroplasts use photosynthesis to make sugar. The mitochondria break down this sugar and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.\nThe nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.\nThe endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.\nAfter proteins are made in the endoplasmic reticulum, they can be transferred to the Golgi. The Golgi is an organelle made up of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances. Then, the Golgi sends these substances to different parts of the cell. Some of these substances are sent to the cell membrane and released from the cell.\nIn plant cells, the vacuole stores waste, water, and nutrients such as sugar. Most plant cells have one vacuole.\nOther cell parts are not surrounded by their own membranes. These cell parts are not organelles.\nThe cell wall is the cell's tough outer covering. It gives the cell strength and stiffness and helps the cell keep its shape.\nOn the inside of the cell wall is a thin layer called the cell membrane. This layer is a membrane, but it does not have a membrane surrounding it, so it is not an organelle. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell.\nThe cytoplasm is a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell. The cytoplasm also helps the cell keep its shape and supports the other cell parts.The cell wall is the outer layer of a plant cell. It gives the cell strength and stiffness, which helps the cell keep its shape. The cell wall also supports and protects the cell."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nBased on this information, what is this Channel catfish's phenotype for the body color trait?\n\nHint:\nIn a group of Channel catfish, some individuals have a brown body and others have a white body.

Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.\nThe symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.\nThe symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for fluoromethanol contains four symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, F for fluorine, and O for oxygen. So, fluoromethanol is made of four chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, fluoromethanol is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for helium contains one symbol: He. So, helium is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, helium is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for boron trifluoride contains two symbols: B for boron and F for fluorine. So, boron trifluoride is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, boron trifluoride is a compound, not an elementary substance."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat does the euphemism in this text suggest?\nErik is big-boned, so despite being in middle school, he often shops in the men's department.\n\nChoices:\nA.

For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.\nHumans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.\nA mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.\nA pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.\nHowever, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure.

In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.\nImagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?\nFirst, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.\nNext, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.\nSo, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWould you find the word pour on a dictionary page with the following guide words?\npatience - pulley\n\nChoices:\nA. no\nB. yes\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nGuide words appear on each page of a dictionary.

This fly has two alleles for brown eyes.\n\nChoices:\nA. ee\nB. brown eyes\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait.

Both are caused by heating.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nWater evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.\nMelting glass is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The glass changes from solid to liquid. But a different type of matter is not formed.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nBoth changes are caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat information supports the conclusion that Ryan acquired this trait?\n\nHint:\nRead the description of a trait.\nRyan is good at identifying insects.\n\nChoices:\nA.

In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted coat (A) is dominant over the allele for a black coat (a).\nZuri is a leopard from this group. Zuri has the heterozygous genotype Aa for the coat pattern gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. a spotted coat\nB. a black coat\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Zuri's phenotype for the coat pattern trait. First, consider the alleles in Zuri's genotype for the coat pattern gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for a spotted coat (A) is dominant over the allele for a black coat (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.\nZuri's genotype of Aa has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Zuri's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The chemical formula for lithium bromide is LiBr.\n\nChoices:\nA. a compound\nB. an elementary substance\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nThere are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nThe atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.\nThe atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether lithium bromide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for lithium bromide, LiBr, contains two atomic symbols: Li for lithium and Br for bromine. So, the formula tells you that lithium bromide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.\nSince lithium bromide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, lithium bromide is a compound."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nAnswer the riddle.\nI am outside.\nI can be very tall.\nBirds may live in me.\nWhat am I?\n\nChoices:\nA. a tree\nB. a dog\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nA tree is outside.\nA tree can be very tall.\nBirds may live in a tree."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nAccording to Newton's third law, what other force must be happening?\n\nHint:\nIsaac Newton was born in the 1600s and studied how objects move.

Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.\nThe symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.\nThe symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for chloromethane contains three symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, and Cl for chlorine. So, chloromethane is made of three chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, chloromethane is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for calcium contains one symbol: Ca. So, calcium is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, calcium is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for phosphine contains two symbols: P for phosphorus and H for hydrogen. So, phosphine is made of two chemical elements bonded together.

Both are only physical changes.\nB. Both are caused by heating.\nC. Both are chemical changes.\nD. Both are caused by cooling.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nCrushing a mineral into powder is a physical change. The mineral breaks into tiny pieces. But it is still made of the same type of matter.\nDry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation.\nDry ice becoming a gas is a physical change. A change of state does not form a different type of matter.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nDry ice sublimating is caused by heating.

In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for solid coloring (A) is dominant over the allele for white spots (a).\nWalker is a cow from this group. Walker has the homozygous genotype AA for the coat pattern gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. white spots\nB. solid coloring\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Walker's genotype for the coat pattern gene is AA. Walker's genotype of AA has only A allelles. The A allele is for solid coloring. So, Walker's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be solid coloring.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Walker's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for solid coloring (A) is dominant over the allele for white spots (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.\nWalker's genotype of AA has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Walker's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be solid coloring."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nComplete the statement.\nSodium iodide is ().\n\nHint:\nSodium iodide can be used to help treat certain types of cancer. The chemical formula for sodium iodide is NaI.\n\nChoices:\nA. an elementary substance\nB. a compound\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nThere are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nThe atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.\nThe atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether sodium iodide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for sodium iodide, NaI, contains two atomic symbols: Na for sodium and I for iodine. So, the formula tells you that sodium iodide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.\nSince sodium iodide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, sodium iodide is a compound."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nUsing only these supplies, which question can Sofia investigate with an experiment?\n\nHint:\nSofia likes to skip rocks at the river.

How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?\nFirst, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.\nNext, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.\nSo, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nSuppose Mia decides to go as a superhero.

The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling.

In this group, the gene for the cheek color trait has two alleles. The allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant over the allele for pale orange cheeks (r).\nCaptain is a cockatiel from this group. Captain has the heterozygous genotype Rr for the cheek color gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. bright orange cheeks\nB. pale orange cheeks\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Captain's phenotype for the cheek color trait. First, consider the alleles in Captain's genotype for the cheek color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant over the allele for pale orange cheeks (r). This means R is a dominant allele, and r is a recessive allele.\nCaptain's genotype of Rr has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Captain's phenotype for the cheek color trait must be bright orange cheeks."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich figure of speech is used in this text?\nHe had hoped to find his missing watch, but he couldn't find the time.\n\nChoices:\nA. allusion\nB. pun\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nFigures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way.

Both are caused by cooling.\nB. Both are chemical changes.\nC. Both are only physical changes.\nD. Both are caused by heating.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nA piece of pizza rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the pizza breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter.\nBurning a candle is a chemical change. Both the wick and the melted wax burn. They react with oxygen in the air and turn into soot, carbon dioxide, and water.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nBurning is caused by heating. But a piece of pizza rotting is not.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the temperature of the water in a hot bath?\n\nHint:\nSelect the better estimate.\n\nChoices:\nA. 40°F\nB. 40°C\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nMeasurements are written with both a number and a unit.
