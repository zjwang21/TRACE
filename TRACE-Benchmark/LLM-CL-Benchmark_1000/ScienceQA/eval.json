In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a black body (b) is recessive to the allele for a gray body (B).\nA certain fruit fly from this group has the homozygous genotype BB for the body color gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. a gray body\nB. a black body\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.The fruit fly's genotype for the body color gene is BB. The fruit fly's genotype of BB has only B allelles. The B allele is for a gray body. So, the fruit fly's phenotype for the body color trait must be a gray body.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the fruit fly's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black body (b) is recessive to the allele for a gray body (B). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.\nThe fruit fly's genotype of BB has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the fruit fly's phenotype for the body color trait must be a gray body."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich change best matches the sentence?\nA lake dries up after many years of no rain.\n\nChoices:\nA. erosion\nB. meteorite crash\nC. drought\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\n"}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nComplete the sentence.\nFossils are () of ancient organisms.\n\nChoices:\nA. the living tissues\nB. preserved remains of the body parts or activities\nC. human-made models\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nFossils are preserved remains of the body parts or activities of ancient organisms.\nSome fossils show the body parts of organisms.

Both are chemical changes.\nB. Both are only physical changes.\nC. Both are caused by cooling.\nD. Both are caused by heating.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same.

In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).\nLady is a horse from this group. Lady has the heterozygous genotype Ll for the coat color gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. a reddish-brown coat\nB. a black coat\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Lady's phenotype for the coat color trait. First, consider the alleles in Lady's genotype for the coat color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.\nLady's genotype of Ll has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Lady's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich logical fallacy is used in the text?\nMr. Conway argues that we need to do more to prevent workplace injuries and fatalities.

It has many elements that make it different from ordinary writing. Knowing these elements can help you talk about poetry, understand it better, and enjoy it more.\nA poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.\nEnd rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.\nLittle Betty Blue,\nLost her holiday shoe.\n—From Mother Goose\nInternal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.\nSweet dreams of pleasant streams.\n—From William Blake, \"A Cradle Song\"\nRhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.\nHe watches from his mountain walls,\nAnd like a thunderbolt he falls.\n—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, \"The Eagle\"\nThe syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.\nFree verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.\nThe old bridge has a wrinkled face.\nHe bends his back\nFor us to go over.\n—From Hilda Conkling, \"The Old Bridge\"\nThe syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.\nRepetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.\nThe dainty flying squirrel\nIn vest of shining white,\nIn coat of silver gray,\nAnd vest of shining white.\n—Adapted from Mary E. Burt, \"The Flying Squirrel\"\nAlliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.\nWhere the wild men watched and waited\nWolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.\n—From Bayard Taylor, \"A Night with a Wolf\"\nOnomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.\nSometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:\nTlot-tlot! tlot-tlot!

Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. Air is a gas.A coin is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. Many coins are made of solid metal.\nA crayon is a solid. You can break a crayon into pieces.

Thistle has two alleles for a hairy fleece.\n\nChoices:\nA. a hairy fleece\nB. FF\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Thistle's observable version of the fleece type trait is a hairy fleece.

In this group, the gene for the tail spots trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i).\nPebbles is a guppy from this group. Pebbles has the homozygous genotype ii for the tail spots gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. a spotted tail\nB. an unspotted tail\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Pebbles's genotype for the tail spots gene is ii. Pebbles's genotype of ii has only i alleles. The i allele is for an unspotted tail. So, Pebbles's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be an unspotted tail.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Pebbles's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.\nPebbles's genotype of ii has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Pebbles's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be an unspotted tail."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich sentence states a fact?\n\nChoices:\nA.

In this group, the gene for the agouti fur trait has two alleles. The allele A is for having agouti fur, and the allele a is for not having agouti fur.\nOliver, a cat from this group, has agouti fur. Oliver has two alleles for having agouti fur.\n\nChoices:\nA. AA\nB. having agouti fur\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Oliver has two alleles for having agouti fur (A). So, Oliver's genotype for the agouti fur gene is AA."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat information supports the conclusion that Anne inherited this trait?\n\nHint:\nRead the description of a trait.\nAnne has green eyes.\n\nChoices:\nA.

The chemical formula for 2-chloroethanol is C2H5ClO.\n\nChoices:\nA. a compound\nB. an elementary substance\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nThere are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nThe atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.\nThe atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether 2-chloroethanol is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for 2-chloroethanol, C2 H5 ClO, contains four atomic symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, Cl for chlorine, and O for oxygen. So, the formula tells you that 2-chloroethanol is composed of four chemical elements bonded together.\nSince 2-chloroethanol is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, 2-chloroethanol is a compound."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nUsing only these supplies, which question can Trudy investigate with an experiment?\n\nHint:\nTrudy is outside with her friend on a sunny day.

When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.\nImagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?\nFirst, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.\nNext, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.\nSo, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich logical fallacy is used in the text?\nHow could Hazel have anything insightful to say about foreign affairs?

Both are caused by heating.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nA piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.\nIf you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air.

Both are only physical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "D\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nPouring milk on oatmeal is a physical change. The oatmeal and milk form a creamy mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.\nWater evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nWater evaporating is caused by heating.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene.

Both are only physical changes.\nB. Both are caused by heating.\nC. Both are chemical changes.\nD. Both are caused by cooling.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nMetal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.\nA piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.\nIf you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change didn't happen to that part of the apple.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nNeither change is caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nAssume all other forces on Linda are balanced.

This plant has two alleles for red fruit.\n\nChoices:\nA. red fruit\nB. FF\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait.

Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. Air is a gas.A ring is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A ring keeps its shape, even when you take it off your finger.\nA ballet shoe is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. When a dancer wears a ballet shoe, it may bend a little. But the ballet shoe still has a size and shape of its own.\nA hammer is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A hammer is made of iron and wood. Both iron and wood are solids.\nWet paint is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour wet paint out of a can, the paint will change shape.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same.

A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Chanel's genotype for the fur length gene is FF. Chanel's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for short fur. So, Chanel's phenotype for the fur length trait must be short fur.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Chanel's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nChanel's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait.

In this group, the gene for the fruit taste trait has two alleles. The allele for sweet fruit (f) is recessive to the allele for sour fruit (F).\nA certain muskmelon plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the fruit taste gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. sour fruit\nB. sweet fruit\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.The muskmelon plant's genotype for the fruit taste gene is ff. The muskmelon plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for sweet fruit. So, the muskmelon plant's phenotype for the fruit taste trait must be sweet fruit.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the muskmelon plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for sweet fruit (f) is recessive to the allele for sour fruit (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nThe muskmelon plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the muskmelon plant's phenotype for the fruit taste trait must be sweet fruit."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich basketball has a higher temperature?\n\nHint:\nTwo basketballs are identical except for their thermal energies.\n\nChoices:\nA. the basketball with more thermal energy\nB. the basketball with less thermal energy\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nMatter is made of tiny particles called atoms.

The chemical formula for beryllium is Be.\n\nChoices:\nA. an elementary substance\nB. a compound\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nThere are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nThe atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.\nThe atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether beryllium is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for beryllium contains one atomic symbol: Be. So, the formula tells you that beryllium is composed of only one chemical element.\nSince beryllium is composed of only one chemical element, beryllium is an elementary substance."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nTwo rocks have the same temperature but different masses.

Both are only physical changes.\nB. Both are caused by heating.\nC. Both are caused by cooling.\nD. Both are chemical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "D\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nMetal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. Silver jewelry tarnishing is a chemical change. The silver reacts with sulfur in the air to form black tarnish. The tarnish is a different type of matter that was not there before the change.\nBoiling sugar to make caramel is a chemical change. The heat causes the sugar to change into a different type of matter. Unlike sugar, the new matter is brown and sticky.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nBoiling sugar is caused by heating. But silver tarnishing is not.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nSelect the one animal that has all of the bird traits listed above.\n\nHint:\nBirds are a group of animals with similar traits.

Bb\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene.

Both are caused by cooling.\nB. Both are chemical changes.\nC. Both are only physical changes.\nD. Both are caused by heating.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nA copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction forms a different type of matter called copper oxide. The copper oxide is green.\nBoiling sugar to make caramel is a chemical change.

A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Jack's phenotype for the cheek color trait. First, consider the alleles in Jack's genotype for the cheek color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant over the allele for pale orange cheeks (r). This means R is a dominant allele, and r is a recessive allele.\nJack's genotype of Rr has one dominant allele and one recessive allele.

Both are caused by cooling.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nA sandwich rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the sandwich breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter.\nA tarnished silver spoon is one that has become less shiny over time.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.

Plants can make their own food.\nHow do plants make food? Plants use a process called photosynthesis to make sugar. They use this sugar as food.\nFor photosynthesis, a plant needs water, carbon dioxide, and energy from light. Most plants use energy from sunlight. The plant uses its roots to take in water. It uses its leaves to take in carbon dioxide from the air.\nDuring photosynthesis, chlorophyll in the plant's leaves traps energy from sunlight.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene.

In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.\nImagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?\nFirst, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.\nNext, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights.

Both are only physical changes.\nB. Both are caused by heating.\nC. Both are chemical changes.\nD. Both are caused by cooling.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nAn iceberg melting is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. An iceberg is made of frozen water. As it melts, the water changes from a solid to a liquid. But a different type of matter is not formed.\nCooking a pancake is a chemical change. Pancakes are made from pancake batter. A cooked pancake is a different type of matter than pancake batter. Pancake batter is wet and slippery. Cooked pancakes are fluffy and can be good to eat!\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nAn iceberg melting is a physical change. But cooking a pancake is not.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nCooking a pancake is a chemical change. But an iceberg melting is not.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nBoth changes are caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich logical fallacy is used in the text?\nMr. Hoffman argues that we need to do more to prevent workplace injuries and fatalities.

Milo has two alleles for straight fur.\n\nChoices:\nA. FF\nB. straight fur\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Milo has two alleles for straight fur (F).

It is no longer used because it is poisonous. The chemical formula for carbon tetrachloride is CCl4.\n\nChoices:\nA. an elementary substance\nB. a compound\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nThere are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nThe atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.\nThe atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether carbon tetrachloride is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for carbon tetrachloride, CCl4, contains two atomic symbols: C for carbon and Cl for chlorine. So, the formula tells you that carbon tetrachloride is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.\nSince carbon tetrachloride is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, carbon tetrachloride is a compound."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nSelect the one substance that is not a mineral.\n\nChoices:\nA.

For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.\nHumans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.\nA mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.\nA pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.\nHowever, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.\nMolasses is a liquid. But all minerals are solids.\nMolasses is made by humans.

Both are only physical changes.\nB. Both are caused by heating.\nC. Both are chemical changes.\nD. Both are caused by cooling.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nMelting glass is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The glass changes from solid to liquid. But a different type of matter is not formed.\nCooking an egg is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change. Cooked egg and raw egg are different types of matter.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nMelting glass is a physical change. But cooking an egg is not.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nCooking an egg is a chemical change.

In this group, the gene for the Thomsen disease trait has two alleles. The allele M is for having Thomsen disease, and the allele m is for not having Thomsen disease.\nTammy, a human from this group, has Thomsen disease. Tammy has one allele for having Thomsen disease and one allele for not having Thomsen disease.\n\nChoices:\nA. having Thomsen disease\nB. Mm\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Tammy has one allele for having Thomsen disease (M) and one allele for not having Thomsen disease (m).

In this group, the gene for the tail spots trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i).\nKraken is a guppy from this group. Kraken has the homozygous genotype II for the tail spots gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. a spotted tail\nB. an unspotted tail\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Kraken's genotype for the tail spots gene is II. Kraken's genotype of II has only I allelles. The I allele is for a spotted tail. So, Kraken's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be a spotted tail.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Kraken's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.\nKraken's genotype of II has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Kraken's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be a spotted tail."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nComplete the sentence so that it uses personification.\n\"You might think you'll always be young,\" Mrs. Ballard counseled, \"but time ()\".\n\nChoices:\nA. creeps up on you\nB. affects everyone\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nPersonification is giving human characteristics to nonhuman things.

In this group, the gene for the tail spots trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i).\nSebastian is a guppy from this group. Sebastian has the homozygous genotype ii for the tail spots gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. a spotted tail\nB. an unspotted tail\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Sebastian's genotype for the tail spots gene is ii. Sebastian's genotype of ii has only i alleles. The i allele is for an unspotted tail. So, Sebastian's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be an unspotted tail.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Sebastian's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.\nSebastian's genotype of ii has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Sebastian's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be an unspotted tail."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich sentence states a fact?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nThe atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.\nThe atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether silver bromide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for silver bromide, AgBr, contains two atomic symbols: Ag for silver and Br for bromine. So, the formula tells you that silver bromide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.\nSince silver bromide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, silver bromide is a compound."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nBased on this information, what is Athena's phenotype for the fur color trait?\n\nHint:\nIn a group of Bengal tigers, some individuals have orange fur and others have white fur.

In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for a black coat (A) is dominant over the allele for a spotted coat (a).\nKumal is a jaguar from this group. Kumal has the homozygous genotype aa for the coat pattern gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. a spotted coat\nB. a black coat\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Kumal's genotype for the coat pattern gene is aa. Kumal's genotype of aa has only a alleles. The a allele is for a spotted coat. So, Kumal's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Kumal's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black coat (A) is dominant over the allele for a spotted coat (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.\nKumal's genotype of aa has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Kumal's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nSelect the taiga ecosystem.\n\nChoices:\nA.

Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.\nThe symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.\nThe symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.You can tell whether ammonia is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for ammonia is NH3.

A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.The watermelon plant's genotype for the ground spot color gene is gg. The watermelon plant's genotype of gg has only g alleles. The g allele is for a white ground spot. So, the watermelon plant's phenotype for the ground spot color trait must be a white ground spot.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the watermelon plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a yellow ground spot (G) is dominant over the allele for a white ground spot (g). This means G is a dominant allele, and g is a recessive allele.\nThe watermelon plant's genotype of gg has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the watermelon plant's phenotype for the ground spot color trait must be a white ground spot."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich logical fallacy is used in the text?\nI never wear running shoes when I go jogging.

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nBurning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules.

In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H).\nZelda is a cow from this group. Zelda has the heterozygous genotype Hh for the horns gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. having horns\nB. not having horns\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Zelda's phenotype for the horns trait. First, consider the alleles in Zelda's genotype for the horns gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.\nZelda's genotype of Hh has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Zelda's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich figure of speech is used in this text?\nAfter Brenna cooked and served a scrumptious dinner, Dad boasted that she is the Julia Child of our family.\n\nChoices:\nA. allusion\nB. pun\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nFigures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way.

Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.\nThe symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.\nThe symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.You can tell whether zinc is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for zinc is Zn. This formula contains one symbol: Zn.

In this group, the gene for the body hair trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairless body (b) is recessive to the allele for a hairy body (B).\nSkeeter is a deer mouse from this group. Skeeter has the homozygous genotype bb for the body hair gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. a hairy body\nB. a hairless body\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Skeeter's genotype for the body hair gene is bb. Skeeter's genotype of bb has only b alleles. The b allele is for a hairless body. So, Skeeter's phenotype for the body hair trait must be a hairless body.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Skeeter's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a hairless body (b) is recessive to the allele for a hairy body (B). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.\nSkeeter's genotype of bb has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Skeeter's phenotype for the body hair trait must be a hairless body."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nAssume all other forces on Kinsley are balanced.

Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.\nHowever, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure.

A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Bandit's genotype for the fur color gene is FF. Bandit's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for black fur. So, Bandit's phenotype for the fur color trait must be black fur.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Bandit's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nBandit's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Bandit's phenotype for the fur color trait must be black fur."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich is a compound sentence?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating.

In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a red coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).\nBoxer is a cow from this group. Boxer has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. a red coat\nB. a black coat\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Boxer's genotype for the coat color gene is LL. Boxer's genotype of LL has only L allelles. The L allele is for a black coat. So, Boxer's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Boxer's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a red coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.\nBoxer's genotype of LL has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Boxer's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich figure of speech is used in this text?\nGary's leaving his job?

Both are caused by cooling.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating.

Both are only physical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nBaking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes. The apples become soft, and the crust turns brown.\nCooking an egg is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change. Cooked eggs and raw eggs are made of different types of matter.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nBoth changes are caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nComplete the statement.\nWater is ().\n\nHint:\nOver 98% of the molecules in your body are water molecules. The chemical formula for water is H2O.\n\nChoices:\nA. an elementary substance\nB. a compound\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nEvery substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.\nThe symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.\nThe symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.You can tell whether water is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for water is H2 O. This formula contains two symbols: H for hydrogen and O for oxygen. So, the formula tells you that water is made of two chemical elements bonded together.\nSubstances made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.

Each cell part has a function that helps the cell survive and grow.\nSome cell parts are called organelles. Organelles are cell structures that are surrounded by their own membranes. Here are some of the organelles in plant cells:\nChloroplasts and mitochondria work together to help the cell get the energy it needs. The chloroplasts use photosynthesis to make sugar. The mitochondria break down this sugar and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.\nThe nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.\nThe endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.\nAfter proteins are made in the endoplasmic reticulum, they can be transferred to the Golgi. The Golgi is an organelle made up of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances. Then, the Golgi sends these substances to different parts of the cell. Some of these substances are sent to the cell membrane and released from the cell.\nIn plant cells, the vacuole stores waste, water, and nutrients such as sugar. Most plant cells have one vacuole.\nOther cell parts are not surrounded by their own membranes. These cell parts are not organelles.\nThe cell wall is the cell's tough outer covering. It gives the cell strength and stiffness and helps the cell keep its shape.\nOn the inside of the cell wall is a thin layer called the cell membrane. This layer is a membrane, but it does not have a membrane surrounding it, so it is not an organelle. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell.\nThe cytoplasm is a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell. The cytoplasm also helps the cell keep its shape and supports the other cell parts.Chloroplasts use photosynthesis to make sugar. First, chloroplasts capture energy from sunlight. Then, they use this energy to turn water and carbon dioxide gas into sugar, the plant cell's food.\nA plant cell may have many chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain a green substance called chlorophyll."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich sentence states a fact?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Both are chemical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nBending a paper clip is a physical change. After you bend it, the paper clip has a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter.\nCracking open a peanut is a physical change.

Both are still made of the same type of matter.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nNeither change is caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?\n\nChoices:\nA.

DD\nB. dark brown seeds\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait.

Sasha has one allele for short fur and one allele for long fur.\n\nChoices:\nA. Ff\nB. short fur\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Sasha's observable version of the fur length trait is short fur.

Both are caused by heating.\nB. Both are only physical changes.\nC. Both are chemical changes.\nD. Both are caused by cooling.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nErosion caused by wind is a physical change. The wind carries away tiny pieces of rock. But the pieces of rock do not become a different type of matter.\nMixing sand and water is a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet. But both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nNeither change is caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWould you find the word casket on a dictionary page with the following guide words?\nclatter - comic\n\nChoices:\nA. no\nB. yes\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nGuide words appear on each page of a dictionary.

Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure.

Both are caused by cooling.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nMixing sand and gravel is a physical change. Together, the sand and gravel make a mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.\nTearing a piece of paper is a physical change. The paper tears into pieces. But each piece is still made of paper.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nNeither change is caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the source of the allusion in the sentence below?\nStanley's research on nineteenth-century philosophers led him down the rabbit hole.\n\nChoices:\nA. literature\nB.

In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for solid coloring (A) is dominant over the allele for white spots (a).\nChuck is a cow from this group. Chuck has the heterozygous genotype Aa for the coat pattern gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. white spots\nB. solid coloring\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Chuck's phenotype for the coat pattern trait. First, consider the alleles in Chuck's genotype for the coat pattern gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for solid coloring (A) is dominant over the allele for white spots (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.\nChuck's genotype of Aa has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Chuck's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be solid coloring."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich closing is correct for a letter?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The chemical formula for chloromethane is CH3Cl.\n\nChoices:\nA. a compound\nB. an elementary substance\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nThere are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nThe atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.\nThe atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether chloromethane is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for chloromethane, CH3 Cl, contains three atomic symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, and Cl for chlorine. So, the formula tells you that chloromethane is composed of three chemical elements bonded together.\nSince chloromethane is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, chloromethane is a compound."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat does the idiom in this text suggest?\nMr. and Mrs. Campbell usually see eye to eye, but not when it comes to the controversial mayoral race.\n\nChoices:\nA.

Millie has two alleles for having agouti fur.\n\nChoices:\nA. having agouti fur\nB. AA\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Millie has two alleles for having agouti fur (A).

Both are chemical changes.\nB. Both are only physical changes.\nC. Both are caused by heating.\nD. Both are caused by cooling.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nCooking an egg is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change. Cooked egg and raw egg are different types of matter.\nSalt and vinegar removing tarnish from a penny is a chemical change. The salt and vinegar change the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. This makes the penny look shiny again.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nCooking is caused by heating. But salt and vinegar removing tarnish from a penny is not.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat information supports the conclusion that Ruben acquired this trait?\n\nHint:\nRead the description of a trait.\nRuben knows how to knit sweaters.\n\nChoices:\nA.

So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.\nThe amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.\nIf the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.\nWhen an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...\nincreases | increases\ndecreases | decreases\nstays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between the water balloon and the center of Earth changed.\nPaul was lower than the balcony. As the water balloon fell toward Paul, the distance between the water balloon and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth decreased as the water balloon fell toward Paul."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the source of the allusion in the sentence below?\nBaldwin got off the mountain by the skin of his teeth.\n\nChoices:\nA. the Bible\nB.

Both are caused by heating.\nB. Both are only physical changes.\nC. Both are caused by cooling.\nD. Both are chemical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "D\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nA slice of banana turning brown is a chemical change. The part of the banana in contact with the air reacts with oxygen and turns into a different type of matter.\nCells using oxygen to break down sugar is a chemical change. When sugar is broken down, it forms carbon dioxide and water.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nNeither change is caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nIs the following trait inherited or acquired?\nJenna has a scar on her right leg.\n\nHint:\nHint: Most scars are caused by accidents during a person's life.\n\nChoices:\nA. acquired\nB. inherited\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nOrganisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits.

Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.\nThe symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.\nThe symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.You can tell whether diamond is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for diamond is C. This formula contains one symbol: C for carbon.

This plant has two alleles for potato leaves.\n\nChoices:\nA. potato leaves\nB. ll\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene.

The chemical formula for methane is CH4.\n\nChoices:\nA. an elementary substance\nB. a compound\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nEvery substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.\nThe symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.\nThe symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.You can tell whether methane is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for methane is CH4. This formula contains two symbols: C for carbon and H for hydrogen. So, the formula tells you that methane is made of two chemical elements bonded together.\nSubstances made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, methane is a compound."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nDoes this passage describe the weather or the climate?\nLeah lives in a town with hot summers and freezing cold winters.\n\nChoices:\nA. weather\nB. climate\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nThe atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds Earth.

In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F).\nBriar is a Syrian hamster from this group. Briar has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur texture gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. straight fur\nB. wavy fur\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Briar's genotype for the fur texture gene is FF. Briar's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for straight fur. So, Briar's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be straight fur.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Briar's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nBriar's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Briar's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be straight fur."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nHow long is a caterpillar?\n\nHint:\nSelect the best estimate.\n\nChoices:\nA. 38 millimeters\nB. 38 kilometers\nC. 38 centimeters\nD. 38 meters\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nMeasurements are written with both a number and a unit.

Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. Air is a gas.The air inside a soccer ball is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. The air fills all the space inside the soccer ball. If air leaks out, it will expand into the space around the ball.\nWater droplets are a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you collect water droplets in a bucket, they will take the shape of the bucket. But the water droplets will still take up the same amount of space.\nA robot is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A robot can move. But if it moves across a room, the robot will still have a size and shape of its own.\nHelium is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. Helium is lighter than air. So, if you fill a balloon with helium, the balloon will rise. If helium leaks out of the balloon, the helium will expand into the space around the balloon."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the mass of an ear of corn?\n\nHint:\nSelect the best estimate.\n\nChoices:\nA. 13 ounces\nB. 13 tons\nC. 13 pounds\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nMeasurements are written with both a number and a unit.

Both are only physical changes.\nB. Both are caused by heating.\nC. Both are chemical changes.\nD. Both are caused by cooling.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nMetal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.\nFiring a clay pot in a hot kiln is a chemical change. High temperatures cause the clay to slowly harden. After several hours in the kiln, the clay will have changed into a different type of matter.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nFiring clay is caused by heating. But a penny tarnishing is not.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich sentence uses a simile?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Toby has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur length gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. short fur\nB. long fur\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles.

A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Toby's genotype for the fur length gene is ff. Toby's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for long fur. So, Toby's phenotype for the fur length trait must be long fur.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Toby's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for long fur (f) is recessive to the allele for short fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nToby's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Toby's phenotype for the fur length trait must be long fur."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the volume of a glass of milk?\n\nHint:\nSelect the best estimate.\n\nChoices:\nA. 1 gallon\nB. 1 cup\nC. 1 fluid ounce\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nMeasurements are written with both a number and a unit.

Golgi\nB. chromosomes\nC. nucleus\nD. vacuole\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "D\nPlant cells are made up of many different parts. Each cell part has a function that helps the cell survive and grow.\nSome cell parts are called organelles. Organelles are cell structures that are surrounded by their own membranes. Here are some of the organelles in plant cells:\nChloroplasts and mitochondria work together to help the cell get the energy it needs. The chloroplasts use photosynthesis to make sugar. The mitochondria break down this sugar and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.\nThe nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.\nThe endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.\nAfter proteins are made in the endoplasmic reticulum, they can be transferred to the Golgi. The Golgi is an organelle made up of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances. Then, the Golgi sends these substances to different parts of the cell. Some of these substances are sent to the cell membrane and released from the cell.\nIn plant cells, the vacuole stores waste, water, and nutrients such as sugar. Most plant cells have one vacuole.\nOther cell parts are not surrounded by their own membranes. These cell parts are not organelles.\nThe cell wall is the cell's tough outer covering. It gives the cell strength and stiffness and helps the cell keep its shape.\nOn the inside of the cell wall is a thin layer called the cell membrane. This layer is a membrane, but it does not have a membrane surrounding it, so it is not an organelle. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell.\nThe cytoplasm is a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell. The cytoplasm also helps the cell keep its shape and supports the other cell parts.The vacuole stores water, waste, and nutrients such as sugar.

Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Chanel's observable version of the body hair trait is a hairless body. So, Chanel's phenotype for the body hair trait is a hairless body."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The chemical formula for zirconium is Zr.\n\nChoices:\nA. a compound\nB. an elementary substance\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nEvery substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.\nThe symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.\nThe symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.You can tell whether zirconium is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for zirconium is Zr. This formula contains one symbol: Zr.

Scientists classify animals with similar traits into a group.To decide if an animal is part of a group, look at the traits of the group.\nBirds have the following traits:\nThey have feathers.\nThey have wings.\nThey have a beak.\nThey make eggs with shells.\nCompare each animal's traits to the group's traits. Select the animal with traits similar to the group's traits.\nA Chinese alligator has the following traits:\nIt has scaly, waterproof skin.\nIt makes eggs with shells.\nA Chinese alligator does not have all of the traits of a bird. A Chinese alligator is a reptile.\nA blue-footed booby has the following traits:\nIt has feathers.\nIt has wings.\nIt has a beak.\nIt makes eggs with shells.\nA blue-footed booby has the traits of a bird.

So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.\nThe amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.\nIf the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.\nWhen an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...\nincreases | increases\ndecreases | decreases\nstays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between the motorcycle and the center of Earth changed.\nThe top of the hill is higher than the bottom of the hill.

In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.\nImagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?\nFirst, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.\nNext, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.\nSo, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich word would you find on a dictionary page with the following guide words?\nflutter - fur\n\nChoices:\nA. found\nB. fed\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nGuide words appear on each page of a dictionary.

Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.\nThe symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.\nThe symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for boron trifluoride contains two symbols: B for boron and F for fluorine. So, boron trifluoride is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, boron trifluoride is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for fluoromethane contains three symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, and F for fluorine. So, fluoromethane is made of three chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, fluoromethane is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for xenon contains one symbol: Xe. So, xenon is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.

For example, the government decided in 2005 that it was cruel to put someone to death for a crime he or she committed before the age of 18. Today, Americans continue to question what is cruel and unusual. In the future, some punishments used today may be outlawed. The text of the Eighth Amendment is below. Does it have rules against anything else? Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat does the verbal irony in this text suggest?\n\"It was my good luck to have to study for a test while all my friends went to the water park,\" Noah remarked.\n\nChoices:\nA.

Both are caused by heating.\nB. Both are chemical changes.\nC. Both are caused by cooling.\nD. Both are only physical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "D\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nDust settling out of the air is a physical change. As the dust settles, or falls, it might land on furniture or the ground. This separates dust particles from the air, but does not form a different type of matter.\nMelting wax is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The wax changes from solid to liquid. But it is still made of the same type of matter.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nWax melting is caused by heating. But dust settling out of the air is not.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWould you find the word general on a dictionary page with the following guide words?\ngloomy - grew\n\nChoices:\nA. no\nB. yes\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nGuide words appear on each page of a dictionary.

In this group, the gene for the fruit texture trait has two alleles. The allele for smooth fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for fuzzy fruit (f).\nA certain tomato plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the fruit texture gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. fuzzy fruit\nB. smooth fruit\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.The tomato plant's genotype for the fruit texture gene is ff. The tomato plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for fuzzy fruit. So, the tomato plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait must be fuzzy fruit.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the tomato plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for smooth fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for fuzzy fruit (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nThe tomato plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the tomato plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait must be fuzzy fruit."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nComplete the statement.

In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h).\nCheyenne is a cow from this group. Cheyenne has the homozygous genotype HH for the horns gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. not having horns\nB. having horns\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Cheyenne's genotype for the horns gene is HH. Cheyenne's genotype of HH has only H allelles. The H allele is for not having horns. So, Cheyenne's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Cheyenne's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.\nCheyenne's genotype of HH has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Cheyenne's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the volume of a kitchen sink?\n\nHint:\nSelect the better estimate.\n\nChoices:\nA. 26 milliliters\nB. 26 liters\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nMeasurements are written with both a number and a unit.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating.

Both are caused by cooling.\nB. Both are caused by heating.\nC. Both are only physical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nRoasting a marshmallow is a chemical change. The type of matter on the outside of the marshmallow changes. As a marshmallow is roasted, it turns brown and crispy.\nGrilling a hamburger is a chemical change. Heat from the grill causes the matter in the meat to change. Cooked meat and raw meat are different types of matter.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes.

Hera has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. a red coat\nB. a black coat\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Hera's genotype for the coat color gene is LL. Hera's genotype of LL has only L allelles. The L allele is for a black coat. So, Hera's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Hera's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a red coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.\nHera's genotype of LL has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait.

The chemical formula for cobalt is Co.\n\nChoices:\nA. an elementary substance\nB. a compound\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nEvery substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.\nThe symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.\nThe symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.You can tell whether cobalt is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula.

In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele E is for red eyes, and the allele e is for brown eyes.\nA certain fruit fly from this group has red eyes. This fly has two alleles for red eyes.\n\nChoices:\nA. red eyes\nB. EE\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. The fruit fly's observable version of the eye color trait is red eyes. So, the fly's phenotype for the eye color trait is red eyes."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat information supports the conclusion that Eli acquired this trait?\n\nHint:\nRead the description of a trait.\nEli knows how to fly a kite.\n\nChoices:\nA.

It has many elements that make it different from ordinary writing. Knowing these elements can help you talk about poetry, understand it better, and enjoy it more.\nA poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.\nEnd rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.\nLittle Betty Blue,\nLost her holiday shoe.\n—From Mother Goose\nInternal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.\nSweet dreams of pleasant streams.\n—From William Blake, \"A Cradle Song\"\nRhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.\nHe watches from his mountain walls,\nAnd like a thunderbolt he falls.\n—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, \"The Eagle\"\nThe syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.\nFree verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.\nThe old bridge has a wrinkled face.\nHe bends his back\nFor us to go over.\n—From Hilda Conkling, \"The Old Bridge\"\nThe syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.\nRepetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.\nThe dainty flying squirrel\nIn vest of shining white,\nIn coat of silver gray,\nAnd vest of shining white.\n—Adapted from Mary E. Burt, \"The Flying Squirrel\"\nAlliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.\nWhere the wild men watched and waited\nWolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.\n—From Bayard Taylor, \"A Night with a Wolf\"\nOnomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.\nSometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:\nTlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.\n—From Alfred Noyes, \"The Highwayman\"\nSometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:\nHark! the honey bee is humming.\n—From Mary Howitt, \"The Voice of Spring\"This poem uses end rhyme.

Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.\nThe symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.\nThe symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules.

This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for cyclopropane contains two symbols: C for carbon and H for hydrogen. So, cyclopropane is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, cyclopropane is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for phosphine contains two symbols: P for phosphorus and H for hydrogen. So, phosphine is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, phosphine is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for argon contains one symbol: Ar. So, argon is made of one chemical element.

Peaches has one allele for bright orange cheeks and one allele for pale orange cheeks.\n\nChoices:\nA. bright orange cheeks\nB. Rr\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Peaches has one allele for bright orange cheeks (R) and one allele for pale orange cheeks (r).

In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A).\nAce is a cow from this group. Ace has the heterozygous genotype Aa for the coat pattern gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. white spots\nB. solid coloring\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Ace's phenotype for the coat pattern trait. First, consider the alleles in Ace's genotype for the coat pattern gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.\nAce's genotype of Aa has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Ace's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be solid coloring."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich block of steel has less thermal energy?\n\nHint:\nTwo 4-kilogram blocks of steel are identical except for their temperatures.\n\nChoices:\nA. the hotter block of steel\nB. the colder block of steel\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nMatter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.\nThe energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.\nTemperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.\nWhat happens if the amount of matter changes? A 1-kilogram brick at 70°F has half as much thermal energy as a 2-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the smaller brick has half as many atoms.

Ll\nB. white legs\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene.

Both are only physical changes.\nB. Both are caused by cooling.\nC. Both are caused by heating.\nD. Both are chemical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "D\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nMilk going sour is a chemical change. The type of matter in the milk slowly changes. The new matter that is formed gives the milk its sour taste.\nDeep-frying chicken is a chemical change.

In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F).\nNutmeg is a Syrian hamster from this group. Nutmeg has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur texture gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. wavy fur\nB. straight fur\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Nutmeg's genotype for the fur texture gene is ff. Nutmeg's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for wavy fur. So, Nutmeg's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be wavy fur.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Nutmeg's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nNutmeg's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Nutmeg's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be wavy fur."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat do these two changes have in common?\na piece of apple turning brown\nbleaching clothes\n\nChoices:\nA.

Both are caused by cooling.\nB. Both are caused by heating.\nC. Both are chemical changes.\nD. Both are only physical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "D\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nButter melting on a hot day is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The butter changes from solid to liquid, but it is still made of the same type of matter.\nLoose matter such as sand and dirt is called sediment. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change.\nThe sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. This separates the water from the sediment. But separating a mixture does not form a different type of matter.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nButter melting on a hot day is caused by heating.

Each cell part has a function that helps the cell survive and grow.\nSome cell parts are called organelles. Organelles are cell structures that are surrounded by their own membranes. Here are some of the organelles in plant cells:\nChloroplasts and mitochondria work together to help the cell get the energy it needs. The chloroplasts use photosynthesis to make sugar. The mitochondria break down this sugar and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.\nThe nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.\nThe endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.\nAfter proteins are made in the endoplasmic reticulum, they can be transferred to the Golgi. The Golgi is an organelle made up of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances. Then, the Golgi sends these substances to different parts of the cell. Some of these substances are sent to the cell membrane and released from the cell.\nIn plant cells, the vacuole stores waste, water, and nutrients such as sugar. Most plant cells have one vacuole.\nOther cell parts are not surrounded by their own membranes. These cell parts are not organelles.\nThe cell wall is the cell's tough outer covering. It gives the cell strength and stiffness and helps the cell keep its shape.\nOn the inside of the cell wall is a thin layer called the cell membrane. This layer is a membrane, but it does not have a membrane surrounding it, so it is not an organelle. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell.\nThe cytoplasm is a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell.

The chemical formula for silicon carbide is SiC.\n\nChoices:\nA. an elementary substance\nB. a compound\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nThere are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nThe atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.\nThe atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether silicon carbide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for silicon carbide, SiC, contains two atomic symbols: Si for silicon and C for carbon. So, the formula tells you that silicon carbide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.\nSince silicon carbide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, silicon carbide is a compound."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich is a simple sentence?\n\nChoices:\nA.

In this group, the gene for the body hair trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy body (B) is dominant over the allele for a hairless body (b).\nCoco is a cat from this group. Coco has the heterozygous genotype Bb for the body hair gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. a hairy body\nB. a hairless body\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Coco's phenotype for the body hair trait. First, consider the alleles in Coco's genotype for the body hair gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for a hairy body (B) is dominant over the allele for a hairless body (b). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.\nCoco's genotype of Bb has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Coco's phenotype for the body hair trait must be a hairy body."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the volume of a kiddie pool?\n\nHint:\nSelect the better estimate.\n\nChoices:\nA. 1,145 milliliters\nB. 1,145 liters\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nMeasurements are written with both a number and a unit.

Atoms are always moving.\nThe energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.\nTemperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.\nWhat happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms.

Atoms are always moving.\nThe energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.\nTemperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.\nWhat happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms.

This plant has two alleles for single flowers.\n\nChoices:\nA. ff\nB. single flowers\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.

Daffodil has the homozygous genotype HH for the horns gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. not having horns\nB. having horns\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.

A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Daffodil's genotype for the horns gene is HH. Daffodil's genotype of HH has only H allelles. The H allele is for not having horns. So, Daffodil's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Daffodil's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.\nDaffodil's genotype of HH has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Daffodil's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nHow long is a soccer field?\n\nHint:\nSelect the better estimate.\n\nChoices:\nA. 120 meters\nB. 120 kilometers\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nMeasurements are written with both a number and a unit.

A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.You can tell whether fluoromethane is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for fluoromethane is CH3 F. This formula contains three symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, and F for fluorine. So, the formula tells you that fluoromethane is made of three chemical elements bonded together.\nSubstances made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, fluoromethane is a compound."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat kind of sentence is this?\nWho took the wheelbarrow out of the shed?\n\nChoices:\nA. declarative\nB. interrogative\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nThere are four kinds of sentences.\nA declarative sentence is a statement.

So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Salem's genotype for the agouti fur gene is aa. Salem's genotype of aa has only a alleles. The a allele is for not having agouti fur. So, Salem's phenotype for the agouti fur trait must be not having agouti fur.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Salem's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for not having agouti fur (a) is recessive to the allele for having agouti fur (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.\nSalem's genotype of aa has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Salem's phenotype for the agouti fur trait must be not having agouti fur."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nThe trucks begin to move at the same speed.

For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.\nHumans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.\nA mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.\nA pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.\nHowever, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure.

Sandy has the homozygous genotype bb for the body color gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. a golden body\nB. a gray body\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles.

In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait.

The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating.

In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele for black eyes (e) is recessive to the allele for red eyes (E).\nGilligan is a koi fish from this group. Gilligan has the homozygous genotype ee for the eye color gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. red eyes\nB. black eyes\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Gilligan's genotype for the eye color gene is ee. Gilligan's genotype of ee has only e alleles. The e allele is for black eyes. So, Gilligan's phenotype for the eye color trait must be black eyes.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Gilligan's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for black eyes (e) is recessive to the allele for red eyes (E). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.\nGilligan's genotype of ee has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Gilligan's phenotype for the eye color trait must be black eyes."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich figure of speech is used in this text?\nJen's phone slipped out of her pocket, landing in the toilet with a plop.\n\nChoices:\nA. verbal irony\nB. onomatopoeia\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nFigures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way.

In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.\nImagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?\nFirst, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable.

In this group, the gene for the tail spots trait has two alleles. The allele I is for a spotted tail, and the allele i is for an unspotted tail.\nUndyne, a guppy from this group, has a spotted tail. Undyne has two alleles for a spotted tail.\n\nChoices:\nA. a spotted tail\nB. II\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Undyne's observable version of the tail spots trait is a spotted tail.

In this group, the gene for the tail spots trait has two alleles. The allele for an unspotted tail (i) is recessive to the allele for a spotted tail (I).\nMer is a guppy from this group. Mer has the homozygous genotype ii for the tail spots gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. a spotted tail\nB. an unspotted tail\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Mer's genotype for the tail spots gene is ii. Mer's genotype of ii has only i alleles. The i allele is for an unspotted tail. So, Mer's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be an unspotted tail.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Mer's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for an unspotted tail (i) is recessive to the allele for a spotted tail (I). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.\nMer's genotype of ii has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Mer's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be an unspotted tail."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich word does not rhyme?\n\nChoices:\nA. sing\nB. long\nC. thing\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nRhyming words are words that end with the same sound.\nThe words tip and slip rhyme.

In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A).\nWinnee is a cow from this group. Winnee has the homozygous genotype aa for the coat pattern gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. solid coloring\nB. white spots\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Winnee's genotype for the coat pattern gene is aa. Winnee's genotype of aa has only a alleles. The a allele is for white spots. So, Winnee's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be white spots.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Winnee's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.\nWinnee's genotype of aa has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Winnee's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be white spots."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich word does not rhyme?\n\nChoices:\nA. pine\nB. dine\nC. cane\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nRhyming words are words that end with the same sound.\nThe words tip and slip rhyme.

During photosynthesis, these organisms use light energy, carbon dioxide, and water to produce sugars and oxygen.\nPhotosynthetic organisms also often have the following characteristics:\nThey are producers, which are organisms that make their own food inside their cells. Because producers make their own food, they typically do not eat other organisms.\nTheir cells contain chloroplasts, which are cell structures where photosynthesis occurs.\nTheir chloroplasts often contain a green substance called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll captures light energy from the Sun to power photosynthesis.\nThey use the sugars they produce during photosynthesis as food. This food provides energy that helps the organisms live, grow, and reproduce.This organism is photosynthetic:\nThe text tells you that thistle plant cells contain chloroplasts.

Both are caused by cooling.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nStretching a rubber band is a physical change. The rubber band gets longer. But it is still made of the same type of matter as before.\nAn iceberg melting is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. An iceberg is made of frozen water.

In this group, the gene for the thorns trait has two alleles. The allele for having thorns (R) is dominant over the allele for not having thorns (r).\nA certain rose plant from this group has the heterozygous genotype Rr for the thorns gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. having thorns\nB. not having thorns\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine the rose plant's phenotype for the thorns trait. First, consider the alleles in the plant's genotype for the thorns gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for having thorns (R) is dominant over the allele for not having thorns (r). This means R is a dominant allele, and r is a recessive allele.\nThe rose plant's genotype of Rr has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the thorns trait must be having thorns."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich word would you find on a dictionary page with the following guide words?\ncarpet - chick\n\nChoices:\nA. cellar\nB. costume\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nGuide words appear on each page of a dictionary.

If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.\nWhat happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two watermelons are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the watermelon with less thermal energy has a lower temperature."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nBased on this information, what is Echo's phenotype for the myotonia congenita trait?\n\nHint:\nThis passage describes the myotonia congenita trait in goats:\n\nIn a group of goats, some individuals have myotonia congenita and others do not. In this group, the gene for the myotonia congenita trait has two alleles. The allele M is for having myotonia congenita, and the allele m is for not having myotonia congenita.\nEcho, a goat from this group, does not have myotonia congenita. Echo has two alleles for not having myotonia congenita.\n\nChoices:\nA. not having myotonia congenita\nB. mm\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Echo's observable version of the myotonia congenita trait is not having myotonia congenita. So, Echo's phenotype for the myotonia congenita trait is not having myotonia congenita."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat does the allusion in this text suggest?\nTyler seems to have the Midas touch.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nRust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.\nBurning a piece of wood is a chemical change.

Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. Air is a gas.The air from a hair dryer is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. A hair dryer uses a fan to blow warm air out.

The allele for yellow fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for green fruit (f).\nA certain ornamental gourd plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the fruit color gene.\n\nChoices:\nA. green fruit\nB. yellow fruit\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles.

Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.The ornamental gourd plant's genotype for the fruit color gene is ff. The ornamental gourd plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for green fruit. So, the ornamental gourd plant's phenotype for the fruit color trait must be green fruit.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the ornamental gourd plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for yellow fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for green fruit (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nThe ornamental gourd plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the ornamental gourd plant's phenotype for the fruit color trait must be green fruit."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Both are chemical changes.\nB. Both are caused by cooling.\nC. Both are caused by heating.\nD. Both are only physical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "A\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nMilk going sour is a chemical change. The type of matter in the milk slowly changes. The new matter that is formed gives the milk its sour taste.\nRoasting a marshmallow is a chemical change. The type of matter on the outside of the marshmallow changes. As a marshmallow is roasted, it turns brown and crispy.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nRoasting is caused by heating. But milk going sour is not.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nDoes this passage describe the weather or the climate?\nOver the weekend, the wind was too weak to fly a kite in Plentywood, Montana.\n\nHint:\nHint: Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time.

Both are caused by cooling.\nB. Both are only physical changes.\nC. Both are caused by heating.\nD. Both are chemical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "D\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nRust forming on a bicycle frame is a chemical change. Oxygen in the air reacts with iron in the bicycle frame. The outside of the frame turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.\nGrilling a hamburger is a chemical change. Heat from the grill causes the matter in the meat to change. Cooked meat and raw meat are different types of matter.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nCooking a hamburger is caused by heating. But rust forming on a bicycle frame is not.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat does the verbal irony in this text suggest?\n\"This salsa could use a little more spice,\" Cameron said as he gulped down water and wiped tears from his eyes.\n\nChoices:\nA.

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nBurning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles.

A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Astro's phenotype for the coat color trait. First, consider the alleles in Astro's genotype for the coat color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.\nAstro's genotype of Ll has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Astro's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich correctly shows the title of a movie?\n\nChoices:\nA. \"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle\"\nB. ***The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle***\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nThe title of a book, movie, play, TV show, magazine, or newspaper should be in italics.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same.

The allele for not having sickle-cell disease (A) is dominant over the allele for having sickle-cell disease (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.\nKiera's genotype of AA has two dominant alleles.

Honey has one allele for straight whiskers and one allele for curved whiskers.\n\nChoices:\nA. Hh\nB. straight whiskers\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait.

Both are only physical changes.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nWater boiling on the stove is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.\nBaking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes when it is baked. The crust turns brown, and the apples become soft.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nWater boiling is a physical change.

How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?\nFirst, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.\nNext, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.\nSo, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich word does not rhyme?\n\nChoices:\nA. slide\nB. ride\nC. made\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "C\nRhyming words are words that end with the same sound.\nThe words tip and slip rhyme.

In this group, the gene for the fruit taste trait has two alleles. The allele F is for sour fruit, and the allele f is for sweet fruit.\nA certain muskmelon plant from this group has sweet fruit. This plant has two alleles for sweet fruit.\n\nChoices:\nA. ff\nB. sweet fruit\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. The muskmelon plant's observable version of the fruit taste trait is sweet fruit. So, the plant's phenotype for the fruit taste trait is sweet fruit."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich is a compound sentence?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Both are chemical changes.\nB. Both are only physical changes.\nC. Both are caused by cooling.\nD. Both are caused by heating.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nCrushing a mineral into powder is a physical change. The mineral breaks into tiny pieces. But it is still made of the same type of matter.\nPouring milk on oatmeal is a physical change. The oatmeal and milk form a creamy mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nNeither change is caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling."}, {"prompt": "Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich is a compound sentence?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. Air is a gas.A clothespin is a solid.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nCarving a piece of wood is a physical change. The wood changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.\nWater boiling on the stove is a change of state. So, it is a physical change.

Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. Air is a gas.The air inside a tire is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. The air in a tire expands to fill all the space inside the tire. If air leaks out, it will expand into the space around the tire.\nVinegar is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour vinegar into a different container, the vinegar will take the shape of that container. But the vinegar will still take up the same amount of space.\nOxygen is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. Oxygen can be stored in metal tanks. If oxygen leaks out of the tank, the oxygen will expand into the space around the tank.\nA stuffed tiger is a solid.

Atoms are always moving.\nThe energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.\nTemperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.\nWhat happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two meatballs are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter meatball has more thermal energy."}]
