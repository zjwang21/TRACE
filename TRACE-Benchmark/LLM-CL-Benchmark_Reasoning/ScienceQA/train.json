Assume that the athlete's mass did not change.\nThe gravitational potential energy stored between the athlete and Earth () as she sped up around the track.\n\nHint:\nRead the text about a person in motion.\nAn athlete competed in a 5,000-meter wheelchair race. As she began her last lap around the flat track, she pushed hard and sped past another racer.\n\nChoices:\nA. increased\nB. stayed the same\nC. decreased\n\nReasoning:",
        "answer": "Gravitational potential energy is the energy stored in an object as the result of its vertical position or height. The energy is directly proportional to the height of the object. In this case, the athlete is moving around a flat track, meaning her height relative to the Earth is not changing. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between the athlete and Earth stays the same.\nAnswer:B"

But they are carrying different amounts of mail.\n\nChoices:\nA. a mail truck carrying 450 pounds of mail\nB. a mail truck carrying 550 pounds of mail\n\nReasoning:",
        "answer": "According to Newton's second law of motion, the force required to move an object is directly proportional to its mass. This means that the heavier an object is, the more force is needed to move it. In this case, the mail truck carrying 550 pounds of mail is heavier than the one carrying 450 pounds of mail, so it would require a larger force to start moving.\nAnswer:B"

Part of the problem is that many students don't even know what plagiarism means exactly. For teachers, it can be a challenge to spot plagiarism. As a result, several Internet services have been created to help teachers detect copied material by showing the sources of passages that aren't original. Students need to know that any act of using another person's ideas or words without giving credit to that person is plagiarism. They must understand how serious the consequences can be. People who plagiarize may have their reputation and credibility destroyed, and they may be in violation of copyright laws. It is important for students and teachers to work together to prevent plagiarism.\n\nChoices:\nA. by making a general statement before giving examples\nB. by removing text unrelated to the main idea\nC. by discussing one topic before moving on to another\n\nReasoning:",
