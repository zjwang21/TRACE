Committee recommends the bill pass.And thanks for filling in for Council Member Bryan Councilmember of Johnson Johnson.Briefly, this is the kind of usual term permit that we approve here at City Council, a tenure permit with two tenure options. If we were to act today, this would allow for Seattle Children's Research Institutes in the Denny Triangle neighborhood to create two new private communication conduits under Terri Avenue, south of Virginia Street, and north of StuartStreet and Stuart Street. And in the alley between Virginia Street and Stuart Street, north of Ninth Avenue. These will allow them to share data between research facilities on research related to cancer, lupus and other children's related diseases.

Councilor Mosquito, you are the sponsor of this bill, so I'm going to hand it over to you to address this item.Thank you very much. Council President. Colleagues, thank you for considering this legislation. This legislation is related to last year's passed legislation, ordinance 126161, which created the 2021 LTG Taxable Bond Fund and authorized an interim loan to support spending on the West Seattle Bridge in anticipation of the 2021 bond proceeds.This was before the 2021 adopted budget was presented and before the decision between whether or not to repair or replace the West Seattle Bridge. The 2021 adopted budget anticipated additional taxable bond sales for the Overlook Walk and Aquarium Expansion Progress projects, and directed those proceeds to the same fund.Now Finance and Administrative Services Department has since determined that we can sell non taxable bonds for the West Seattle Bridge repair, but that those bond proceeds will need to be held in a separate fund from the taxable bonds.This legislation does just that, this legislation accordingly. This legislation accordingly offers several technical corrections to the bond funds associated with the West Seattle Bridge repair work. And I hope the council will consider this message today.

The ability to listen.The willingness to negotiate. The wisdom. To accept compromises that allow each to feel that its legitimate needs will be met. There are many people in this city to thank for supporting Cherry Creek Tower as the association has confronted the ramifications of losing a large number of our parking spaces.Among those people are Dennis Araghi, now retired from Public Works and apparently walking around with a golf club in his hands instead of his briefcase. Thanks, Dennis, wherever you are. Dave Hunt, Singer and Public Works is proving equally supportive as our new contact going forward.And the civil engineers and landscape architects working with us on behalf of the city have made the process of fleshing out all the necessary details, both a pleasurable and a creative experience. The entire project has a firm direction now, and we would like to express our appreciation for the city's willingness to engage in what I will calla creative win win solution to a long standing dilemma.

Council President Herald This was a bill that we had in committee for longer than we had the comprehensive plan last year. Thanks for referencing it, Amelia. This bill restores something called our categorical exemption for our State Environmental Policy Act thresholds in urban centers back to the levels established by council in 2012.We had a lot of rigorous debate about this. The Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections has a set of protocols that they asked developers to go through that we felt were redundant with what a developer has to go through in order to fulfill the obligations outlined in the CBA documents that the state requires of us.For several years it was the Council adopted policy that developments under a certain number of units. We're not required to go through this CPA process because of those additional requirements that we put on development through our Department of Construction and an inspection process.And so the action that we'll take today would remove the CPA thresholds from just urban centers. So our six urban centers in the city and we've asked the Seattle Department of Construction inspections to come back around to us and talk to us about the implications of what removing those thresholds would mean inside our urban villages.To the committee, you adopted this unanimously after several, several months of rigorous debate at committee, and I would encourage my colleagues to vote yes.Thank you, Councilmember Justin.

The committee recommends the bill pass.Cuts from O'Brien.Thank you. I should say thank you to Councilmember Johnson for cover for me in council briefing this morning. I had a chance to watch you and it's very informative. I thank all of you. It's really fun to sit in bed, blowing my nose, watching the council briefing proceed.The idea behind the play street is great. This is a pilot program that's going on for a little while now. Just so folks know this. This legislation does a little small piece. But I want to take this opportunity to highlight that neighbors throughout the city can apply for a free street.Permit to close down their street. They can if they want to have, for instance, you know, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, after school, kids are going to ride their bikes around the street. They want to close it off at either end.They can get a one time permit that will last for up to six months, for up to three days a week for up to, I think, 6 hours of closure. The idea is that as we find as our city continues to grow with more and more people living in it, we need to find places for folks toplay, which is a really exciting program, is great to see folks out there doing the play streets in a number of places. However, what's been discovered is that we have language in our municipal code that specifically says people are not supposed to play on streets.It was driven by safety concerns, I'm sure. What this legislation actually does is in the section that talks about no roller skating, riding a coaster skateboarding toy vehicle should happen on the streets. It adds the language that says except where allowed by a street use permit.So that's the bulk of this legislation. But the concept is something that's been going on and will continue to go on through the pilot program, which in committee. We asked about that and they said how much longer is going to be a pilot?They said, we're we're about done with the pilot phase and it's going to be a full on program in the city, which is great.Thank you, castro brian, any comments?

Council authorized $1.8 million in bond financing in the 2017 budget, and START has a $1.8 million appropriation authority based on an anticipated $1.8 million bond sale. That bond sale is not happening this year. So the council has requested another method to pay for the $1 million in spending during 2017, along with a proposedreduction of 800,000 in 2017. Appropriation authority included in the second quarter supplemental budget being considered in the Affordable Housing Neighborhoods and Finance Committee. As a heads up.For.The 2018 budget deliberations, Council should be aware that the Council, the executive, plans to request a significant additional appropriation for for this project, an initial appropriation in 3.4 million. But it's important to note that the bond financing is proposed to be funded through the admissions tax revenue, which beginning in 2018 will be 100% dedicated to arts funding. So the funding increase will be covered by a funding source specifically dedicated to arts in the Seattle Municipal Code. The cash balance of the Municipal Arts Fund is $9.8 million, and so funding is clearly available, but we'll be taking that up in the budget process.Very good. Thank you. Any further comments?

You cannot spend more money than you collect in taxes.And there is a limit set on how much taxes you can assess. And that dollar, that amount is set annually in. It can be increased annually. And there's two factors that you could use. One of them and each factor has two variables to it.One is the population factor, which gives you to pick either increase in county or the city population, which in our particular case, this time around, the county growth was greater than the city growth. And therefore, we're using account county growth.And the second factor is related to.Per capita income.Yes, the per capita income, which you have two choices. You can have state per capita income increase that is generally provided by Department of Finance.

Thank you.Colleagues, for this. This legislation was referred directly to the full council. It's being proposed by our Seattle Department of Human Resources.

And this contract will be effective January 1st through December 31st, 2020.And since it's already two and a half years behind, it will be effective retroactive. So the extended process of deliberation proposed a result of a three year process that began in 2016, and it reflects the extended negotiation, as I mentioned.So it will update wages from 2014 and it has no impact on the current budgets since it was included in our 2019 budget and funding in 2020 will be addressed by the executive first in the annual budgeting process and we recommend do pass.The comments I called myself before calling on the passage of the bill. This agenda item approves the union contract, as I said, negotiated with the city of the government and IBEW 77, who represent many Seattle City Light workers who maintain the power lines, substations and power plants to keep the lights on in Seattle on rainy, windy winternights when a tree falls on the power lines and your power goes out. It is IBEW 77 members who go out in the storm and fix the problem. Without their work, we would have no street lights. Amazon would have no power to run their datacenters, and Nucor could not make this deal.These are really the ultimate green jobs providing carbon free power to Seattle and beyond under a good union contract. Seattle should add many more of these positions as part of a Green New Deal to add one generation to Seattle hydropower to export electricity outside the city, replacing the coal and natural gas power used in the region.These call the role of the passage of the Bill Bagshaw.Gonzalez Herbold II.

They're in the process of purchasing the land adjacent to this to the den property.And they need to acquire this parcel.To complete the planned improvements stated in their approved general development plan for North.Stapleton.So really they're the only logical person purchaser due to the parcel location.And that's that's why this makes sense for.Them to purchase this industrial commercial.

I mean, it did it did I do my math, right? That comes out to about 35, $36,000 per acre.11.845 acres.Can you provide me sort of the appraisals that helped set this price for this property? So this was actually sold at the master lease and disposition agreement price. So that's a special price. And then that was set back when for city was was this identified as a parcel that was subject and available for that agreement?I mean, that price this specific one is actually located outside the master lease and disposition agreement.

The the changes that we made in the Select Committee specified that the new use for admissions revenues applies only to the lease agreement for the arena andonly with respect to the admissions tax generated through the operations of the new arena. The reason why this is so important is back in 2017, the city I'm sorry, 2015, the city council passed legislation allocating 75% of all of the ad tax revenue to go to fund the Office of Arts and Culture in the next year in2016. The City Council sort of made a commitment to a multi-year ramp up of of admissions tax with 20 in 2016 going up to up to 80% in 2017 going up to 90%. And in 2018, just last year, we brought it up to 100%.So this this legislation that is as it is before us today, allows us to maintain that commitment to the Office of Arts and Culture.

Well, they could sell the properties that aren't making money. But then they risk housing prices going down, potentially even rent going down. That doesn't seem like a good option. That'll lose money. Well, some of these properties are really cheap to hold on to and maintain.And some of these other ones command a higher rent than they are costing the landlord. They could use these higher rent properties to pay the cheaper properties, property taxes, and just leave it empty. Putting it on the market would make them lose more money than they make by holding on to it.If they want to make sure they make as much money as possible, it is in their best interest to leave that property empty. Allegedly this exact thing is happening in New York City right now due to the COVID exodus.Landlords have realized that instead of lowering rent on all of their properties, they can lower it on a handful of them and still cover their costs. There are empty apartments all over the city while people sleep on the streets.Now some people will see this and think, Well, those landlords are good people. But not all landlords are bad people. To that, I posed this question. If we were in the middle of a water crisis and people were dying of dehydration and a person who happened to buy a couple of different wells before the crisis was sellingaccess to their extra wells at market rate. Would you consider that person a good person? I would call that profiteering. And even grocery stores decided to stop to put a stop to that kind of behavior during the toilet paper shortage of the pandemic.Why can King Soopers see that this behavior needed to be regulated?

So with that, I.Urge your support.These are second second accounts from Richardson. Councilmember Richardson.I support the motion.Okay. I'll just. I'm just going to go out and add also, I think this councilman I think this is actually interesting. So I know it's it's kind of a new model. And so I look forward to hearing back from staff here in the weeks ahead about about this model of financing and housing.So any anytime we can get more workforce housing. That's a that's a great thing. So let's go ahead. I don't see there's any public comments or to a roll call vote.Mr. Mayor, we have one public comment from election.Oh, I'm sorry about that. Go ahead.I think city council members, just very quickly. Very much appreciate your engagement on this on this item. I'm here tonight on behalf of a number of affordable and middle income housing developers. As you know, in the last several days, city of Oakland, San Jose and Carson have adopted similar programs to help meet their respective numbers, as CouncilmemberPierce pointed out. I also want to appreciate staff's engagement. I know that there's been some dialog going on between a number of developers, including Waterford and city staff, and in particular wanted to thank Tom Modica, Lynda Tatum, Christopher Coons and Rick Champion, the city attorney's office for their engagement.I both want to apologize for the urgency in sort of our discussions with city staff in in bringing this to light, but also provide some context. You know, the target of these of this new financing structure is to take class-A buildings and convert them to affordable and middle income housing.And the longer that cities wait, the more right they are for market rate developers to come in and take that housing stock out of the the potential for this program. So, again, very much appreciate everyone's interest. You have a lot of interest from the development community.Thank. You're going to sell.Thank you. Thank you.

So can you tell me a little bit about what that will cover and entail? Exactly.Craig.Certainly Councilmember Gonzales, members of the council, the item that you have before you is really focused on the operating side of our parking lots, not so much the CHP elements, which we we do have a number of those coming forward.But we felt it was prudent to make a reinvestment in many of our facilities, especially the city place garage in the downtown. And we've added a number of security personnel and security hours over the course of 24 seven operation in City Place alone, we've added over 160 hours of security time.Plus under this agreement with central parking who are now ESP plus they put in somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 additional security cameras in that garage, which are now monitored by the security officers. So we've really tried to step up that experience.There's also increased maintenance, power washing. We've increased the frequency of power washing in those garages where we have a number of other items that we're going to be addressing moving forward.

When our office made inquiries about applicants, we were never provided any applicants or a list of people even who had filled out an interest form for this.And so with very rapid gentrification happening in our neighborhood, I think it's critical that when we appoint to these boards, we're taking into consideration the legacy businesses who have lost their voice in this community.

There was a series of meetings of the of the.Committee to look at the different.Options.Available.

Annual Amendment Process Committee recommends the bill passes amended.So this is the committee that I chair and once a year we adopt changes to the comprehensive plan. There was a couple of amendments that were discussed in committee. One was related to making some specific changes to the description of the Chinatown International District based on the community feedback that we'd heard through the Chinatown International District zoningchanges. And the second was an amendment to parks and open space elements. Councilmember O'Brien, you spent a lot of time working on that parks and open space element, and I wanted to give you the chance to speak about it, if you like.But I'm not seeing you jump for a microphone. Okay. One of the other issues that was discussed, both a lot in committee and then also again today in public comment was the issue of future land use map amendment sizes.We did some robust work there and as you may have heard during public comments, chose not to bring forward an amendment that would make a specific change to a vigilante stamp in the Beacon Hill neighborhood. There was a consensus among the committee that that was a great project, a project that all of us on committee liked andappreciated, particularly their commitment to choosing to perform through our mandatory housing affordability program. But when we did the analysis about what sort of scope changes would be required for us to then make requisite size size changes to the future land use map, that that was a precedent that maybe that change was too small of a change forus to make and dig that deep down into the future land use map. So we neglected to bring that amendment forward, although that was a project that I think all of us supported and look forward to seeing. It's future development of I'm not overstepping my bounds, but I'm looking at my colleagues and I'm not seeing any significantobjection. OC Any further discussion about the comprehensive plan.

This issue was brought to my attention after litigation and a decision from the Court of Appeals for the state of Washington. In this case, the Seattle Housing Authority voucher recipient requested a change in her voucher from a studio apartment to a one bedroom apartment as a disability related accommodation.In this case, FHA was not the landlord. The FHA was only the voucher administrator. The court decided, based on a plain reading of the language in the Seattle Municipal Court, in the statutory context, supporting the legislative intent to cover only the landlord tenant relationship.It did not apply to FHA in its role as a voucher administrator. The court noted in its decision that if the city wishes to and extend the unfair practice requirement to include a requirement that Section eight program administrators like FHA making a reasonable accommodation when requested, it can amend the SC accordingly.This legislation is in direct response to the case and does so does amend the settlement code to allow the city to enforce the obligation for reasonable accommodation in instances where a provider is the the the housing and the housing voucher administrator, not the actual landlord.Very good.

That's leaving the ordinance. And the ordinance is basically I'm I guess I'm stumbling because I'm having trouble understanding what it is prohibiting now.Whether it's requiring a permit to do all it says is that it's you need a permit to post a permit to post notices on public property. So the order and it's talked about things that were pretty obvious and but those won't hold over the people will look at this in the future to figure out what can Ido. Won't won't quite.Understand.Whether it means putting a yard sale sign on a tree or whether it means like across the street, Bono's putting a a sandwich board out on the sidewalk or in a Victory Park public property, of course, or perhaps driving.I mean, strange things.Driving a bus down a city street with a sign on the side of it. These are notices and they're posted according to the there's no definitions. And so my initial thought was.The ordinance needs some.Explanation as to what posting and what notices would be defined as, but maybe even better is that you simply gut the whole thing and replace it with nothing and repeal it. I don't see how what we're left with is going to be enforceable.Thank you.Thank you. And the other public comment on the item. Casey None believe there's a motion on the floor. Mr. Clarke. Yes.

In just a moment, we're going to consider 13 appointments to the Seattle Youth Commission. And this particular ordinance changes the nature of the commission a little bit. It reduces the membership from 25 to 15. It shifts the representation to the seven council districts to make sure that each council district has at least one member onthe commission. It changes the term of service for the youth commissioner from one year to two years, and it syncs that appointment period up with the academic school year. It amends language around the annual youth town hall, which is required by the current current ordinance and broadens that so that the Youth Commission can sponsor events including atown hall if they wish, throughout the year and not just one year. It has more general language that allows the appointment of two co-chairs instead of just one chair, and it shifts responsibility for the commission from the Mayor's office to the Department of Neighborhoods.And then it gives authority to the Commission to write their own bylaws and to establish rules for how they will govern the Commission.Thank you very much.

An ordinance relating to the city's traffic code conforming the Seattle Municipal Code with changes in state law, amending sections of the Seattle MRGO Code and adding new sections of the Seattle Municipal to the Seattle Municipal Code.Thank you so much. I moved past Council Bill 120246. Is there a second second? Thank you so much. It's been moved and seconded to pass the Council bill. Colleagues, this is one of those rare and exceptional circumstances in which the legislation is listed on our agenda as not having a sponsor identified for the legislation before its introduction. As a result, as Council President presiding over these proceedings, I'll go ahead and address the substance of the bill. This is this pro forma council bill would adopt a set of amendments to a traffic code in the Seattle Municipal Code to ensure that it conforms with changes to Washington state law.This represents an annual exercise undertaken by the City and the Council to update our local traffic codes to reflect changes made to the state's traffic code in each legislative session. State law prohibits local jurisdictions from enacting or enforcing any ordinance in conflict with the provisions of state traffic laws.And this legislation would ensure the cities, the city, remains in compliance with applicable traffic laws at the Washington state level. As a result, I do recommend that my colleagues support the passage of this legislation to ensure that we continue to have a municipal code that is in compliance and aligned with state law.Are there any additional comments?
