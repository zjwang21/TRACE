        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThank you for being here. We appreciate it. MACK Thank you. Thank you to all our members and good luck. You do not need to come back for the full council meeting. We will turn now to item eight. And as we do that, Jennie Giambattista will brief us I.Wanted to let staff know on item nine that I in a prior dialog I thought that had passed out on our consent agenda. So I see why you're still here. This on the biomethane. We'll see what we can do.I'm not optimistic, but we'll see what we can do to get to it. Hi, Jenny. We had a substantive hour and 15 minute briefing on this piece of legislation that's been worked on very hard by Councilmember Cole. Wells Really the harassment and discrimination last time and we are here today to take a look at her striking amendmentand other potential amendments and see if we can't get it advanced.Good morning. Council members Jenny and John Batiste. Council staff if it's helpful for you, I can give a brief recap of the ordinance or I can jump right into the striking amendment. Which would you prefer? Mr. Chair, I think.We've had the ordinance briefed basically, and we heard concerns last time, and so would it help? Councilman wants to jump to the striking amendment to see how you have proposed to address the House.Thank you, Mr. Chair. Yes, that's fine. And I do want to bring to attention of my colleagues that we do have the materials that were distributed on our table today. So you can get those up. Thank you.So thank you, Mr. Chair. So I'll go through the striking amendment. I have prepared a red line version for you, so the line numbers I will refer to are the red line versions. I think that will allow you to see the changes both clearly.So the primary substantive change that you will see before you in this striking amendment is that the judicial branch participation is now voluntary. And you can see that in lines 191 to 194, where there is a specific language that is added.There's a new Section five that's added that simply requests the Superior Court and the District Court to give consideration to the sections of this ordinance. Additionally, they are encouraged to transmit training options. That is the most significant substantive change to the ordinance.Other changes that I will walk through in the striking amendment largely reflect some of the discussion that was had at the last meeting on this topic. Throughout the ordinance, the phrase each entity managed by a separately elected official is replaced, and that is replaced by simply listing the offices of those separately elected officials.So, for example, on line 72, you will see that that has been replaced by listing the assessor, director of elections, sheriff, counsel and prosecuting attorney. That doesn't change the intent of the ordinance, except, as I indicated earlier, the effect is that the judicial branch is no longer included.So you will see those that phrase deleted, threw out the striking amendment.And if I may, Jenny, just an obvious question for you, or are the are legal officer, but can we direct those separately elected officials to to do this? Or did they have any independence similar to the judiciary, although they're not a separate branch, if you will?I just go back to our paid leave program where, you know, it was essentially.I believe we can, but I would like to defer for confirmation to our legal counsel, Mike Hoover, on that question.He's got rules.He's like, you might as well take a permanent seat here at the green table.Thank you again, Mike Hoover, counsel to the council. This has actually been worked fairly extensively and we believe as it's written now, we do have the ability to direct it, direct those officials named in the current version. There were other versions where we went back and forth on this quite a bit, the courts being the primary onesthat we removed inside over.I see. And I see we have executive branch books here from H.R.. Is that your understanding as well? Okay.Oh.I'm just trying to square in my mind. The reason for the silence is in the prosecuting attorney's office. The prosecutor, Soderberg, I thought, stepped up and did the right thing by on the one paid weeks of leave, offering to, you know, grant that benefit.But I understood that it was discretionary. And so I'm getting nods from some maybe this is somehow different, but it's a still an important now there are now they're shaking their heads. Could somebody from the executive branch come forward and educate me?I'm looking at the lawyer. Yeah, this is I'm not I'm just to understand the difference if there is one or how this works, just from not that I think it should apply to all branches of the government. Right.But I'm trying to understand as a legislator, our ability in this context.Excuse.Islamica prosecutor's office. And Mr. Hoover and I haven't talked about this issue, but I do.Think the prosecutor, like with paid parental leave, agreed that they would be part of this ordinance. But I think there is a question and actually, you know, apropos of your charter review decision or excuse me, discussion this morning, there have been some lines where we have done things because we've always done them that way.And there's some things we're going to need to clarify in the charter about whether the this body can regulate what courts are doing or the prosecutors because.We like the courts.Are a separate branch.But Ms.. Jean Baptiste is correct that the prosecutor's office is happy to, you know, be part of this this effort to.Update policies and report back to the council. But I think that question, if we want to talk about it.Deserves a little more research.Okay, that's helpful. So we're proceeding here with concurrence of the separately elected. But there well, there is a.Or and again, the separately elected in the executive branch.If someone's doing the crazy executive.The assessor, the elections and my sheriff.The sheriff.All of their employees, it says in the charter, in.The executive.Branch.That prosecutors, employees are not in the executive branch.Because that office is established by state.Correct?Yes. Okay. But we.Do have some sort of mix up on how we'll get that all squared away in charter.Review.All right. That's helpful. I appreciate the tutorial.And if I may add just non-legal information. Our chief of staff, Carolyn Bush, did convene a meeting with the chiefs of staff with each of these separately elected officers to discuss the ordinance and the Stryker. And all of those officers were supportive and in fact, suggested the list, the way that this is listed here in terms ofrather than using some phrase, such as each entity managed by a separately elected to actually list them out. So moving on, if I made lines 74 to 75, this was just a a edit to clarify the writing. It doesn't change the intent where the edits here are done to clarify that, that there is a requirement for newor revised training rather than just recommendations for training later on in the ordinance. It's clear that we've tried to make it clear that what is to be transmitted on September 24th, 2018, in terms of training, are training options line 100.The striking amendment insert the word encourages in order to emphasize the intent that the county does want to encourage reporting. So it now reads a description of a reporting system for employees that encourages those who experience workplace discrimination and harassment, including sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct, as those as well as those who observe such behavior to reportit lines 107 to 113. This language was added at the request of Councilmember Balducci in order to provide more direction on what the guidelines for how to handle a complaint should address. I think the information that is added here is consistent with the intent of the underlying ordinance.There are, looks like, a lot of changes on lines 122 to 143. This is just moving text around for clarity. There is a new requirement in there at the end of line 130. And the new requirement is that resources for employees to understand the policies and procedures shall be easily locate able online lines.158 to 164. Were edited for clarity. The prior version could have been read to suggest that we were trying to prevent complaints, which is certainly that was not the intent. And then on lines 177, this is a substantive change in that the requirement for reporting data on informal reporting is changed to when possible.And that was done in consideration that it may not always you may not always have the data on the informal reporting. I would note that the striking amendment has been shared with the executive staff and it has been supported by the executive staff.Get a note on this issue. We got a nod from RH, our director. Okay.So that concludes my comments on the striking amendment. I think you have also has a amendment from Councilmember Lambert as well, which is an amendment to the striking amendment. For a discussion of that amendment, I would like to turn to our legal counsel, Mr. Hoover.Good morning. This amendment is fairly straightforward. The the over the underlying piece of legislation actually directs a variety of departments and agencies in specifically including us to go back, revise and develop our own policies. This amendment that's boring would actually be a little more specific on what should be included in those council policies.And it specifies that if there is a concern or a complaint between council members, not necessarily staff, but council members themselves, a mediation process would be imposed and it would be mandatory. This particular language essentially just directs us to adopt that.So we would be passing. If you pass this amendment, you would be passing an ordinance telling yourselves to go forth and adopt a policy, implementing a a mediation process that would be mandatory where there are concerns or complaints between council members over and above whatever other policies we also have.So this is some specific the ordinance itself is more procedural in terms of asking that processes and politics be developed.I think it's fair to characterize the although the ordinance has some specific standards and benchmarks to meet, the ordinance generally tells departments and agencies to go and develop something. This would be a fairly specific directive to us. Yeah.All right. We'll take these up in order. Councilmember Caldwell's, would you like to put the legislation before the committee?Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I move by ordinance, proposed ordinance 2018 0256 pertaining to discrimination and harassment, including sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct in the King County workplace.All right. And would you like to move striking Amendment One?Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I move striking Amendment One.All right. And Jenny has given us an overview of it. Would you like to speak to it?Okay. Do where do we need to take up the Councilmember Lambert?And then after we take after we well, before we vote on the striking amendment. All right. Councilmember Lambert, would you like to move your amendment?I would. Thank you so much. I'd like to move amendment number one. And it would.Serve. I need a procedural ruling on this. Is this within the scope and object of the legislation Council?I believe it is. I yes, I could elaborate.All right, Councilmember Lambert.Thank you, Mr. Chair. This idea came to me during the meeting that we had with all of our employees. What date was that? Is that Thursday? Thursday? And the question that came up and then we had legal advice is, is what how do these things that other employees can go to their manager?How would that be handled by the council? And I thought, okay, that's an interesting question. And the advice was that we would self-police. And that was very difficult to do. And so I thought, well, how could we do this in a way that's respectful and a way that would be a good example to all the employees thateven when you're an elected official, you're still held to the same kinds of standards and that if we don't have a manager over us, although we do have our constituents, but that doesn't help on a day to day basis that we have a process where we can make sure that we are able to do whatever we needto do to make sure that this is a healthy working environment. And I thought this is a good way of being an example to all of our employees that we to take this very seriously. And if there's a problem that we will go to mediation and get it worked out in a timely way as possible.Thank you. And I'm sorry, Governor, did you move that amend? That's because other council members are concerned about the issue.Thank you, Mr. Chair. So this is one of the innovations, and I think I mentioned this in our last meeting about this ordinance that's in front of us, is that it does include council members. We're not exempted from the requirements that Councilmember Caldwell's has put forward to review our policies and to adopt policies and procedures that addressall of the things that have been now stated as in the ordinance. I will say I lived through an experience on another body where there was an elected official who was alleged to have committed some behaviors that could have qualified as sexual harassment that was on senior staff, possibly not just senior staff, but also was problematic amongsome of the female council members. And so it's very difficult to deal with a situation like that. It's important to deal with it. But it's very difficult because each one of us is here, because the constituents in our district voted for us.And there is nothing that the rest of the council can do about that, that the people we are here and we're here until we get voted out of office or we do something that enables us to be recalled by law.So however, it sends the wrong message if we just shrug our shoulders and say, therefore, there's nothing that can be done if there are complaints like this. I asked a question earlier on the side that I want to ask you again, now that we're speaking in public, and that is can you talk about so first of all, I think the before I frame the question, just one more thought. I'm doing this in real time. I do think that the issue of councilmember behavior is a correct thing that we ought to address. I don't think it should be about councilmember behavior just to other council members.It should be about councilmember behavior to anybody. And I think that there should be a process that is as effective as we can make it, that gets developed, that we use in situations where there is a concern about sexual harassment or discrimination that meets the definition of this policy.Do we have anything like that in the ordinance here? And if so, can you explain what it does now?Yes, we do. The the at the beginning of the ordinance, we actually directed many entities, including ourselves, to go back, review and revise our policies in line with standards that were set forth. If you then go down, I'm trying to think, I guess it's section two D, there actually is a specific provision that is, I think, fairto say, aimed at what you're raising, which is although it applies to any interactions between staff members, etc.. We also ask that the policy include a specific look and and procedures for accounting for power dynamics. I didn't say that very elegantly, but it is to account for the power differential.But when elected officials erect with staff or with each other, I would think.Can you point to line number?Yes, I can. It's in I hope I've got.A very striking amendment on s one lines, 144 to 148.Right. And it reads the policies, procedures and training developed by the and I'm skipping all of some of the people council shall specifically address the power dynamics involving staff and elected officials and how to respond to and prevent discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct by elected officials.So the way I read this amendment in keeping with the striking amendment and the ordinance, because this isn't new language, this is in the underlying proposed ordinance. Right.This what I just read. Yes.Is that the ordinance and the striking amendment would direct all of these parties, including the Council, to go create procedures and policies that do all these things, including this particular thing. And the amendment would say what at least one of those procedures must be in a specific type of situation.It's like sort of getting to the end on this one question, though, because it's so so here's what I'm suggesting. And I look at Councilmember Lambert for a second. I completely agree that mediation is a tool in our toolbox that ought to end up in our final policy, in an appropriate place, with appropriate language around it.Who does it when? I don't know that we can require each other to engage in mediation, but we can certainly encourage each other to do so. But I do think that we're set up right now with this ordinance to tell everybody, apparently set the courts to go and figure out what your policies, procedures and training are goingto be and then come back and then we're going to adopt those things or we're going to implement those things anyway. So I. Wonder, Councilmember Lambert, if you wouldn't be willing to accept that this language says we're going to work on exactly this sort of thing.I'd be willing to work with you. I'm sure Councilmember Caldwell's would be willing to help us with this, as he's been the guiding light on these things, to come up with a procedure that at the end does what we need it to do.Because I support your idea. I do. I like it. There are some tweaks I might propose, but I do think that this gets to a place of stating the end result when this entire ordinance is really about dictating a process to get to the end result tonight.Councilmember Caldwell's stating that correctly in your mind. And thank you, Mr. Chair. Yes, I believe you are. And what we what I've wanted to do throughout this is to be consistent. And my concern with the amendment is that we would be going for a level of specificity with the council and especially particularly with relations between council membersthat we do not have anywhere else in the proposed ordinance. And I think that's the way to go about this. And I agree it's very important is to work on the council's policies and procedures and training to reach the objectives that Council Member Lambert is wishing to have included.Councilmember Lambert, Thank you.I am very concerned about power differential with a staff member. I think it'd be very difficult for a staff member to say Councilmember X has whatever yelled at me, screamed at me, jumped up and down, giving me funny looks, turn green, whatever, because they work for us.And so they would come through either us or through H.R., through the county, if they felt that the processes here weren't working. But for council members, I think that we need to set the tone of good behavior and treat each other with respect and what we you know, what we say to our kids.And, you know, sometimes we give a greater example by what you do than what you say and hopefully what you do and what you say match. But when they don't match, then it's a very bad messages to our children or to anybody around us.And so I think that as we go forth and make our own policies, I think this is an aspect that is very touchy and something we haven't ever talked about before a very much. Although if you look upstairs, we at one point, Julia Patterson did the chart on the wall upstairs about how to treat each other nicely, which has been there a long time. So I'm going to withhold this amendment for the fact that, as we do our own, this is a aspect that I think we need to include and that we also need to make sure that our employees know that we intend to model the very best behavior and not allow things tocontinue that could be swept under the rug in the past.Are you withdrawing Amendment One?I am.All right. That's withdrawn. Are there any other amendments council member made?Just as a final comment, I everything you just said, I agree with and support and will work on. As we move forward to our Council proposal, I commit to working on getting to a place that acknowledges all of those realities that you just outlined.Thank you.Very good. Thank you. Councilmember Caldwell. So I'm sorry, are there any other amendments? No. All right. Councilmember Cole Wells.Thank you, Mr. Chair. In speaking in support of the striking amendment, I would like to just bring out a few things that I think are really critical. First of all, thank you to all the staff and all of the H.R. just across the board.It's been a very productive process that we've been going through for the last six months. But secondly, I think it's really critical that we bring up our whole county, including our council policies and procedures relating to harassment, discrimination, sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct, which would be new in this case.We have to modernize what we have in place, which has been good but has not been adequate to really achieve what we all want. And that is a welcoming work environment where people feel as though they can thrive in a safe and an equitable, a respectful and inclusive environment.And we know that people across the country. In government entities as well as in the private workforce, are reluctant to come up to report discrimination and harassment and inappropriate conduct. And I want to make sure that we're not dealing with the abstract here.We have good policies, but if they're not ones in which people feel comfortable coming forward, then we are having effects on individuals that can be mental, they can be physical, they can result in economic difficulties if they feel like they have to resign.And so my main effort here has been to make sure we have something that works that. We don't have a workforce here that is reluctant to come forward. We are the best county in the state. And I believe with this amendment, with this ordinance, if it is indeed approved by the Council, we will go a long wayin making sure that we have the most productive workforce and that we value our employees as they should. We need policies and procedures that are easily understandable, that don't result in people trying to read them in their eyes, glaze over because, you know, it's like they just don't even want to continue reading that they feel comfortable andall the King County reflects and what we want to have happen. This would result in some cultural change, but it's needed and we will all be better for it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Councilman Coles, thank you for your impressive leadership on this issue, and the amount of work that you've invested in is very impressive given the time. I'd ask that the clerk call the roll on this. I'm sorry. All in favor of the strike amendment.Say I am opposed. That carries. And as they turn to the underlying ordinance as amended, I ask the clerk to call the wrong.Thank you, Mr. Chair.Councilmember Belted. Councilmember Dunn. Councilmember Garza. Councilmember Cornwell's Councilmember Lambert. Councilmember McDermott. Hi, Councilmember of the Grove. Councilmember one right there. Mr. Chair. Hello, Mr. Chair. The vote is seven. Eisner's no nos. Two. Excused.All right, we'll advance that to the full council. Does it does it need to be or can it be expedited? We'd like to expedite it.It can be expedited. That is your policy decision.Would you like to do that, Councilman? Also, let's expedite it and we'll have it on the regular calendar so it can be spoken to with my colleagues permission, if you will. There's one more item that the waste our Truman Division would really like to get addressed today.I think we can do it in 4 minutes. Mr. REED 4 minutes. We went a little long on the charter review, and this is with respect to our environmental attributes legislation which the Council has adopted before.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nMotion carries.25.Communication from city attorney recommendation or clear ordinance, amending the Long Beach Municipal Code related to local enforcement and penalties for illegal marijuana businesses. Read for the first time and lead over to the next regular meeting of the City Council for Final Reading Citywide.Councilman Price.Mr. Vice Mayor.So I've had the probably should have went to staff, but I thought this was yours. I should probably go to Stafford.That's crazy.Thank you. City manager, vice mayor, members of the City Council. On May 2nd, the council requested that our office prepare an ordinance, and we did so amending Chapter 5.9 of the municipal code. And we believe that this proposed ordinance will assist the city in its efforts in conjunction with the enforcement remedies already available to the city toensure compliance with 5.9 and hopefully discourage illegal operations related to medical marijuana dispensaries. Very quickly, the ordinance we have added, the ordinance did declare non licensed facilities a public nuisance. And so we have added in the ordinance in the discretion of the court to issue a maximum civil penalty of up to $5,000 per day per violation forthose illegal dispensaries. We do talk about and authorize the disconnection of utilities after following all the proper procedures. The criminal penalties we believe, were already in place. And so this ordinance at this time does not impose additional or further criminal penalties.And we also have additional enforcement tools allowing us to to institute a one year ban or end up to a five year ban. And with that, we're open for questions. I would like to thank Monica Goleta, deputy city attorney, who was who wrote the ordinance and did a lot of work on it.Thank you.Thank you, Mr. City. Attorney Councilwoman Price.Thank you. I, too, want to thank the city attorney's office and Monica specifically for working on this. I think the ordinance includes all the components that our report requested and the agenda item, initial or agenda item requested. So there are civil penalties associated with it.There is a punishment for the commercial property owner who's leasing to an illegal dispensary. There's the opportunity to get involved with the operation of of utilities at the site, which will hopefully discourage illegal operators. In short, I think that the statute covers all the different aspects that were raised and all the areas of concern.And obviously, once we've implemented the statute, if new situations arise and that's obviously something we can go back and modify or amend our statute to deal with any trends that we might be seeing or may not have anticipated.Again, the genesis of this item is that illegal dispensaries or illegal businesses in general doesn't just have to be dispensaries, illegal businesses, and especially illegal marijuana businesses, because there are several categories of marijuana businesses that will be permitted in the city of Long Beach.Those illegal operations are a disservice to the residents. There's no quality of life regulations that are in place at an illegal operation to ensure that quality of life concerns and issues are accounted for. They're unfair to the legal operators who are paying taxes and incurring the costs associated with following the regulations that the city and the statehave set for them. And they're obviously very detrimental to the city because the costs of enforcing our existing laws, state and local regulations, is very burdensome for the city and can cost the city millions of dollars per site, as we have seen from past experience.So thanks to the city attorney's office for for giving this ordinance to us to consider tonight, and I think you did a fantastic job giving us a great start that we can modify later as situations present themselves. Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember Ewing.Thank you, Ms.. Mayor. And I want to agree with Councilmember Price and all the concerns that are out there regarding the illegal activities in illegal dispensaries. I think it's very important even those individuals who are planning to have legal dispensaries applied and want to get some business going here would agree with with this ordinance.They also would would support something like this in order for them to be able to operate legally, which is the total effort that we're trying to do here. So I'm totally supportive of this ordinance. When I thank the city attorney for putting this together, I think it is going to work very well for the city of LongBeach. Thank you.Thank you. Councilmember Andrews.Yes, thank you, Mayor. Councilman Price, I think that this all of a sudden finally we got some tooth and nail to this ordinance, because I know when we came to it the first U.S. on the diocese at that time, but it was really hard to get to those individuals who were illegal.But now I think that this will let them know when you talk about $5,000 fine, that will let them individuals know. I don't know how much money they'll be making, but that will at least make them understand that we are serious about the illegal operation of the marijuana.And thank you again for bringing us and especially our city attorney putting us together. Thank you again.Thank you. Is there any public comment on this item? Please come forward. You have 3 minutes.Very good who Kirk has the. I won't go into all the details that I referenced last time the subject came up. These would be the fact that the Long Beach Police records. Incontrovertibly. It will show that the landlord for that property has been highly irresponsible and has provided, in essence, a sanctuary for extraordinarily violent criminals.Signet. Syndicate. Syndicate. Period. No trier of fact will ignore that. And I know the city attorney may have given thought. Some flock to this issue. But I think it and the council failed to think about that, which you did not think about.All right. And I'll be going into more of those details later. But essentially, you established areas where you felt it was inappropriate to have that type of activity. But what you failed to consider is the roots that those same individuals that you're trying to protect more often than not on a daily basis.Walk. Like. Scooter. Right past. Period. And that's something I admonish you to. To do that and to consider that. And speaking of and banishment, I think if my math and history is right, we're about nine days short. You know, nine days shy of an admonishment that you might consider, i.e., that one that was admonished by highly, slightly. 30 years ago at the end of this month. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Good evening. Seven more. Sincerely a second district. I wanted to speak on behalf in support of this particular measure. It's a great, solid piece of legislation that provides clear guidelines and explicit consequences for those who are choosing to operate illegally within the city.The only two comments that I have about it are concerning kind of a policy issue behind us. I spoke to some of the council offices earlier about the use of the Long Beach Police Department during these administrative citations.Christopher Ingraham from The Washington Post recently wrote an article detailing some pretty good information that's been gleaned from police, from national police statistics showing that these so-called kinetic or militaristic raids using the law, using the police departments in general raises the specter for violent incidents to occur during where essentially now completely civil and administrative procedures.That's both a waste here locally. The use of police during these administrative inspections essentially is a waste of resources and largely unnecessary, unless there's a specified and articulated reason to believe that the operator, the illegal operators there would be armed and dangerous.I say that being entirely conscientious, that the Code Enforcement Department suffered a murder believe within the last decade of an inspector by mistaken about that. I'm sorry, but I believe I remember that happening. So obviously there is a concern for inspectors out in the field and we and that is to be respected and that has to beupheld. But again, without a specified reason for believing that this could be the case, most of these illegal operators I mean, I'm sure all of the people here would be shocked to believe this actually don't know that they're operating legally.Many of them have just decided it will decide to just start putting plants on the ground without ever consulting an attorney or reading the municipal code. Hopefully, this particular instance provides them the notice that's necessary so we don't have that happening again.But it is. Two other quick comments, too. SB 94 has been recently just was signed, I think today by the governor. So unfortunately, Charlie, the wonderful regulatory packages of the AMA and the NCR say that your office has been working with for the last couple of months, there have now been more or less erased and they're beingcombined into one particular bill, which means that we might have an entirely new comment period to three starting soon with all new regulations from the state level. In terms of in addition to this, the only this particular ordinance, I would recommend highly that the code that the code enforcement or whoever has the jurisdiction over this particular issuedevelops a disposal policy for any seized cannabis they that they might obtain. Not all of it will be useful for it will be useful, are being put are being able to be cultivated immediately. But for those that I know, the Santa Ana Police Department is suffering from an overwhelming just barrage of seized materials.And so developing a policy to provide those medicine to the people who need it would be a good idea.Thank you. You got it in 3 minutes. Seeing no further public comment. Members, please cast your vote on this item.One motion.Carries. Thank you, Madam Clerk. What is the next item we have?

Please read the next item to the record.Agenda Item nine Council Bill 119196 An ordinance amending ordinance 125475 which adopted the 2018 budget, changing appropriations to various departments and budget control levels all by a three quarter vote of the city council. The committee recommends the bill passed as amended.Thank you. And this is the appropriations bill analogous to Scripture, the Bass bill, and I believe Councilmember Skinner will present an amendment. I note you're correct. Of course my notes have been corrected. It's better watch out. This council bill 119196 amends the 2018 Budget Adoption Ordinance by modifying appropriations for the Department of Finance and Administrative Services andFinance General and the Office of Housing and the Human Services Department. It basically dedicates funding from the sale of the communication shop property to, number one, the relocation of the communication shop, a number to the Seattle Rental Housing Assistance Program, which will support people who are on the FHA voucher waitlist and whom are at risk of becominghomeless through the rental voucher system and the Office of Housing Staff support. And this ordinance passed out of committee with three yes votes and four abstentions. Since the committee, there has been various amendments and discussions. And so I know Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Skate and probably everyone on the dais may have something to say about that.But I think we are trying to get to a place where we fully recognize the plight that many are experienced out there of homelessness. And so with that, I will turn to who's speaking first, which I think is Councilmember Mosquito.Wonderful. And thank you, Mr. President. I move to amend Council Bill 119196 by substituting version five for version 2/2 been moved.It's been moved in second to make the amendment. And Councilmember Mosquito, you describe what we're doing.Thank you, Mr. President. There have been a number of conversations that have taken place over the last few days. And first, I want to thank the folks who have testified not just today, but the folks that I've talked to over the last year and a half.Housing and homelessness are the press is the pressing issue in our city right now. Creating a more affordable and equitable city is our goal. I want to thank not just the folks who testified today, but the leadership that I had the chance to speak with and Nichols ville last Friday.And also, I want to thank the mayor for her comments earlier this morning where she said that we must create a city where we act with urgency on short and long term housing needs. And if, Mr. President, if you don't mind, I'm happy to make comments now or later, however you suggest.Now might be a perfect time.Great. I want to be really clear as we enter this conversation about the sale of this parcel of property that as a general rule, I believe that public land should stay in public hands. I also believe that given the limited amount of land, we as a city should be looking at how we preserve all of the parcelsof available land to create affordable housing. Given that the high cost of land impedes our efforts to create more affordable housing for low and middle income residents, and I'll be working with my council colleagues, the mayor's office and the community at large to bring forward greater clarification and expectations and processes so that we can prioritize our desireto see more public land, stay in public hands, to create public housing. As we think about the opportunity that's in front of us today, and given the various considerations that have been put forward from the mayor's office and from this council, it makes sense to me that this small parcel of land, which has limitations on it interms of our ability to create affordable housing, that we consider selling it and that we have conditionalities associated with it, that it goes into providing housing for short and long term health care needs, housing both in creating long term structures that can house individuals now and into the future, and funding for critical services in our community.For those who are unsheltered, this can support is conditional. And when we have one time revenue, I believe we must focus investments on capital improvements, capital improvements into homeless shelters and services and create stable programs and stable structures that can provide the housing that many folks need and also prevent folks from falling into homelessness.I want to thank Councilmember Herbold, especially also Councilmember Brian Bagshaw, Suarez Gonzales and myself. We've heard your comments and we've heard the committee public testimony over the last few months. This amendment that you see in front of us is reflective of the need for hygiene infrastructure, for short term housing and emergency shelter needs for long term.Housing and infrastructure needs in our community. It builds on what the mayor proposed to us, and it helps to make sure that we're looking at stable, progressive revenue in the future so that we can increase, not just maintain, but increase programmatic and operational costs associated with services for the unsheltered low income and moderate income.This version of the bill ensures that we authorize the spending of the proceeds for immediate needs and long term housing needs, and that we're committed to identifying clear, stable funding streams for programs and operations in the future. This version also makes it clear that capital investments should be made on structures, shelters, housing and additional capital projects, notdisproportionately on short term projects or short term infrastructure like tents. I believe we also must broaden our scope of what structures we're thinking about as we think about housing those who are unsheltered and in need of affordable housing, including tiny houses like the one that I saw on Friday, identifying more locations for tiny house villages, making surethat we're investing in backyard cottages such as the block project. Identifying opportunities for us to build modular housing, housing that can be mobile and structures that last for 20 years or more. This is the innovative type of new investments that we need to be thinking of.Let's also think of how we can purchase and build single room occupancy buildings, multi-family housing options, and let's build those structures for the community that needs it now and the community that needs it in the future. These are new and innovative structures that we must take on because business as usual is not working.Creating affordable units that are five over seven or seven floors tall is not going to address the housing crisis that we have in front of us. We got to work with our nonprofit partners and think of ways that we can create short term and long term solutions for our community, who needs affordable housing units and childcare andplaces to go and enjoy and community settings so that we can continue to organize? So all options must be on the table for consideration as we move forward. If we're going to truly create long term, meaningful, affordable change so that all of Seattle can live here, I'm committed to working with my colleagues.I'm committed to working with the mayor. I'm committed to working with all of you and the community at large so that we can identify ways that we can build the housing that we need and that every parcel of available land is developed into affordable housing options or public assets for our community to enjoy.Again, I want to thank Councilmember Bagshaw, who shepherd us through last Wednesday's conversation and Councilmember Herbold for her work over the weekend. In the last few days, Councilmember Gonzalez for her work to continue to identify ways that we can ask the right questions to make sure that we're getting the right funding and right conditionalities associated with this. And I really I really want to also note the central staff who worked over the weekend on this. Thank you, Alan. Thank you, Amy. Thank you, Tracy. Just a quick thank you to my team as well, to Michael Maddox and Councilmember Herbold, same as well.I'll be voting in favor of this. And this is not just for a short term investment, though. This is a long term commitment and this is just the beginning.Thank you. Councilmember skater Katherine, make sure I recognize your moment if you'd like to speak. But I have a few hands going up, so I'm going to recognize Councilmember Herbold.Thank you so much, Council President Harrell. The substitute bill itself adds 1 million in additional bridge funding for emergency shelter and drop in hygiene services. It also adds some recitals outlining potential public health concerns and addressing the need for bridge funding for service providers who either receive decreased funding or whose funding was not renewed via the homelessnessinvestments RFP. In addition, the bill itself will preserve all $5.3 million from the mayor's original bridge housing proposal as it relates specifically to the hygiene services funding. You know, we all know and we've heard today that hygiene services are an essential part of our region's public health response.It's important that we learn from the hepatitis A outbreaks in cities such as Los Angeles, San Diego and Santa Cruz. Doctors Bill Daniel and Dr. Ben Danielson of the Seattle King County Board of Health in an October crosscut wrote.This does not look like an emergency response to us as medical and public health professionals. We stress that people will die unnecessarily if they are left on the streets while hoping and waiting for permanent housing. The risks for people living on the streets and the need for emergency action are grimly illustrated by ongoing outbreaks of Hepatitis Ain California. The San Diego outbreak has yielded more than 500 cases, with 70% requiring hospitalization and 19 deaths. Homeless people and drug users account for a large majority of cases and outbreaks followed in Los Angeles, in Santa Cruz.And the California governor just declared a state of emergency over all of the outbreaks. Unlike Habitat. It is has B and C. Hepatitis A is spread through close personal contacts. Theses and limited access to hygiene resources. This spread can be prevented with basic sanitation and hygiene.A public health crisis like this in Seattle is absolutely preventable. Hepatitis A is is spread through close personal contact and limit, exacerbated by limited access to the kinds of hygiene services that we are looking to ensure that there is continued funding for.With this budget action, HST has confirmed that the majority of the additional funding for hygiene services announced in its December RFP announcements are for people who are staying at shelters that received increased investments. These are not drop in shelters.These are services that are available for folks who are clients of those shelters, so are great. We have a continued great need for hygiene services for folks who are not clients of any particular shelter. Considering we have upwards of more than 3000 people who are unsheltered in our city without this vital funding, this important tool in ourpublic health response will close without a clear plan of how to support the people currently accessing these services to get their basic needs met. As it relates specifically to the shelter investments in this in this legislation, I've said before and I'll say it again, I am absolutely supportive of HST Pathways Home Initiative to increase funding for 24seven shelter and low barrier shelter. But I'm only supportive with a concrete proposal to provide a realistic transition plan for the people who are currently accessing services at the sites that did not receive funding. Efforts to transition people to other services should occur and be demonstrated as successful before bridge funding is terminated.The emergency shelter bridge funding outlined in this bill would allow organizations such as Share Wheel to maintain essential shelter services through 2018. I also really want to thank share wheel residents and church hosts of Cher. We'll Shelter's for your advocacy and your education to us of how your services make people safe in community, how your shelters aremore than just mats on the floor, how your shelters have a good track record of access to stable housing, and how important it is to the housed residents in Seattle and our city to have a way to partner and welcome the unhoused into our communities.Kathy Olson of the Woodland Park United Methodist Church said it well at Councilmember Sawant's special evening committee meeting last week. She said, They are part of our community and we are part of theirs. I want to extend my thanks to Councilmember Sawant for keeping the focus on the needed addition of funds for emergency shelter and hygiene services, as well as services for homeless women. And her efforts specifically last week to bring impacted parties into council chambers and hear directly for them from them on how these services improve their their day to day lives. I want to also thank Councilmember Mosqueda for giving me the chance to work with her on some shared interests that wehave around this legislation. I also want to thank Councilmember Gonzales, who although she's not here today, by getting a majority of councilmembers to vote for a delay on the allocation of the 5.2 million gave us the room to have the conversation that we needed to have about how to focus this legislation on not just the council's interests, but the public's needs. And again, also extend my thanks to essential staff, my staff, Shannon Perez, and as well to to Michael in Councilmember Mosquito's office.Thank you, Herbold. Any further comments from any of my colleagues? We are going to vote on the just the substitution in a second. We have another opportunity so we could talk to we could do the substitution first and then come back to the amended and then, okay, so let's just do the amendment, the substitution first because itstarted and moved in second and that's on the floor. All those in favor of the substitution, please say I am not opposed. So we have a substitute, a version and I saw a councilmember whereas. And then Councilmember Sharma was Sharma.That's what it was. I saw it first. But am I seeing things?So I'll go. You'll let Councilmember Debra go? You said Councilmember Sharma.I know. I said Councilmember. Whereas. And then Councilmember Sharma. I thought.I did, but. So what?I'm sorry.I'm just giving you a hard time.Councilmember Deborah.Thank you. I just briefly want to say this on a on a more of a professional and a personal note. In the two years that I've had this job, it's the first time that I had an opportunity to sit down with Councilmember Bagshaw and Councilmember Mosqueda on more than one occasion and actually caucus.We actually sat down and said, got together and each talked to each other and said, What can we live with? What can't we live with? What can we do? What, what? What needs can we meet to do this collectively?To really show that Seattle City Council does care? There's no one has cornered the market about who cares more about your issues. We all do. As you know, we're within the constraints of being elected leaders in a budget and how we move forward.I had the opportunity to sit down with Katherine Lester for 2 hours and be able to to learn. I've learned a lot, but to be able to infuse those ideas into my conversations with my colleagues. And so I'm very I'm very happy.And I'm hoping that this trend continues, that your leaders up here spend time talking to each other about important issues. So we do have legislation and audiences that produce something where we can agree on what's best for our city and do it together.I don't always think there has to be animosity. I don't think there has to be negativity. I don't think that people have to be unkind. I think we just have to talk. And as I've said this once and I'll say it again, and what I've learned and what I know to be true in Indian Country is thatlanguage is culture and culture is behavior. And if you change the language, you change the behavior. So I'm very, very happy today to be able to support this. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Walsh. Councilmember Swan.Thank you, Brian Harrow. I support this amendment because it restores most of the funding that was lost by Cher real shelters and the urban rest jobs during the Human Services Department's last homeless funding grant. It will mean that showers and laundry services for the people who rely on them for their jobs will be open for more hoursof the day. And it will mean that the shelter beds that were outrageously scheduled to be eliminated this year will remain open. It is not unfortunately enough in the sense that it funds 1 million, which is a really big improvement, but the providers estimated 1.2 million to fully restore their funding.And I only point this out because we I don't think the council and elected officials should be nickel and diming these essential services like that. But I think the paramount take home message from what's happening today in terms of this amendment is exactly what one of the speakers in public comment, Emily MacArthur, said, which is that whenwe fight, we win, as Councilmember Herbold mentioned. We are here just eight days after the big town hall that we did on Monday last week, where over 250 people attended. But what was most important was who was at the table.We didn't have, you know, bureaucrats or department executives at the table. We had service providers themselves and the service users themselves. Queen Bee was at the table, for example, and Nedra Freeman was a table with the table Michelle Martian, who helped John was at the table.And I think what we heard was quite eloquently described by council member Herbold. And I thank you for attending the town hall analogy, then, Councilmember O'Brien, for sending a supportive message. That means a lot. I don't want to focus on the amendment itself because of course we are in support of that.But more raise the question of pathways home that Councilmember Herbold alluded to. And for council members who haven't who weren't who weren't there at the town hall on Monday, I really urge you to watch the Seattle Channel video.Formerly homeless people who use the share will share animal shelters in the past talked about the community and stability they have found. They're using that, allowing them to transition to permanent housing. So the what's happened is a Human Services Department explained last December that their decision, based on the Pathways Home approach to defund, share and real wasbecause their funding applications did not show anyone that transition to permanent housing. If that is the case, then it is a problem with the application, not with the reality of the program, because we met individuals on Monday who had transitioned successfully to housing.I wanted to quote from Michelle Marshawn, who runs real and my office she spoke at. She was at the table and she spoke about this about Pathways Home. And my office transcribed a portion of what she said at the table on Monday.And so I'm quoting her now, The Pathways Home report that has become the roadmap for the Seattle Human Services Department blames us for the intractability of homelessness and completely ignores the deep economic divisions and housing injustice of our city today.Pathways Home is a cruel euphemism and shocking reversal of decades long partnerships and hard won progress in our community. It forces competition among people and programs to gain scarce housing resources in order to keep city funding. It is not a pathway, and it does nothing to create a home.Pathways Home was not demanded or reviewed by homeless people themselves. It's not like homeless people themselves rose up and said, Hey, why don't you all go to hundreds of shelter beds, clothes, hygiene programs and don't limit all of us to force us to compete for too few housing spots.Again and again, the speakers in public comment and at the table pointed out the irony of saying we should transition people to housing and that's why we're going to cut shelter funding at a time when housing has never been more unaffordable than now.Homeless women and men because of these cuts are suffering and at risk today because of the slashing and shuttering of their basic survival service network. It is not by accident that Women in Black will stand for the greatest one month number of outdoor violent homeless deaths.15 people this Wednesday, one month into the Pathways Home Changes Pathways Home I'm still quoting Michelle Broadway's home was not demanded, reviewed or analyzed by workers who spend many years on the ground doing this work. The department that led this process of defunding defending programs under this euphemism, whose leaders are not even here to listen to ustonight, lacks foundational experience, full knowledge of the realities of homeless people and the work being done to keep people together and safe. There are if we had lofty rhetoric about valuing and prioritizing continuing homeless leadership to the highest levels of provider agencies.But they did not involve homeless people in the original report. The creation of the RFP and the defunded the only homeless led agencies will ensure that exist in Seattle today. So I think really what for me, two things are important out of what's happening today.One is that when we actually build a fighting movement, we can win sometimes in record time. So let's remember that. And two, we need to look closely into this Pathways Home program, and we should not accepted. I mean, today's victory shows that we should not accept anything as a done deal.The mayor's office may say it's a done deal. The Human Services Department is it's a done deal. Many council members may say it's a done deal, but it's our duty to fight for what's right. So I will be in my committed to Human Services, Equitable Development and Renters Rights Committee.I will be holding discussions in the coming months to review Pathways Home and its outcomes. And we so we will we will be doing that in a serious way. And I really urge councilmembers to participate in it, and especially thank Councilmember Herbold for continuing to highlight the problems in the based home logic and more than anyone else. I want to thank all the activists, organizers and the regular people who came out last Monday and were the people who were instrumental in winning today's victory. And bottom line, if Pathways Home and if the mayor wants to talk about housing, we love housing.We want housing. That is why we are demanding that the city council pass a strong $200 million progressive revenue tax by taxing big business very soon so that we can build over a thousand units of permanently affordable housing.You know, automatically if it's publicly owned, it's automatically rent controlled housing. So if we build over a thousand units every year, then we can actually begin to tackle. That's not going to be enough. But that is far more than we could be doing today.So I would urge us that we continue building this movement so that we can win a $200 million tax on big business so that we can actually address the affordable housing question. Thank you.To. Okay. We're about to vote.Councilman Baxter, did you want to say any words before we vote?I'll just be really quick. Thanks to all of you, first of all, for letting me call in and vote and to listen to public comments and to all of your comments. I really want to focus, too, and say thanks to council members Mosqueda Herbold and whereas, because really what you guys did was help us identify the problemsand find solutions that we could all live with. And that's a real key. Also, I want to acknowledge the mayor for her commitment to getting people inside fast. That's a big change from where we've been over the last couple of years, and having her support is going to be invaluable.So I'm certainly supporting this. Of course, I want to continue with these short term options that we've all been talking about. And as council members watch has said, getting more permanent housing is key. It takes everybody coming together and not fighting each other, but finding the solution.So I'm with you.Thank you. Casper Bagshaw and Councilmember Brian.Thank you. I'm also really appreciative of the work of colleagues to get to the place where we are today. It's exciting. Only a few days after that last discussion to have some resolution around this, to be able to make a commitment to something.The folks in our community, including those who showed up today to extend the bridge and make these investments, we need to make both an affordable housing and an emergency shelter.Thank you, Casper and Brian. Okay. I think we are ready to vote. Excellent. All great comments. So at this point, I would ask the clerk to please call the roll on the passage of the amended bill.Sergeant Bagshaw. Hi.Herbold.

The committee recommends the bill passed as amended.Thank you, Councilmember Harrell.Thank you very much, Council President. Before I get into the substance of the ordinance, I have two amendments. The First Amendment has two components of them, and then the second one is a technical amendment. So let me move.Let me read the amendments and let me get them in the record, and then I'll describe how these amendments fit into the context of the entire ordinance. So having said that, I move to amend Council Bill 118347 Section 21 by substituting subsection A3 of SME C 21.6 .170 with the following paragraph.Now, clerk, I'm going to have to, I have to read this literally in the record verbatim. Correct. Yes. I'll take that as a yes.Or you can have the clerk read it. Whichever.I'll read it. I like to hear myself read sometimes. Okay.

The Office of Cable Communications shall provide these quarterly reports for the first five years of a new franchise and for the first two years of a renewed franchise and shall continue to provide these quarterly reports thereafter, ifso requested by the Chair of the Council Committee with Oversight Responsibility for Cable Issues. The other part of the amendment is this. And by adding a new subsection four entitled The Office of Cable Communication shall develop procedures and metrics to implement this subsection 21.6 0.1708 to describe how compliance with the low income service provision requirement will bemeasured and what threshold of service will be deemed to constitute compliance. That is the First Amendment that I move.That it's moved in second, and the Councilmembers Herald Harrell's amendment be adopted. You want to make any comments or are there any questions?Did any of you understand that?Yes, we understand it. You did a good job in briefing this morning. All in favor of the amendment vote. I oppose vote no. The amendment is unanimously adopted.Okay. And in all seriousness, I will talk about what these amendments do does to the base legislation. The Second Amendment is a very simple one. I move to amend Council Bill 118347, section 32 to fill in two blanks with council bill number 118347.It's moved and seconded that Councilmember Harrell Second Amendment be adopted. Any questions all in favor of adopting the amendment vote. I oppose vote no. The amendment is unanimously adopted.Okay. Thank you very much. So the legislation as amended, we're basically revising the cable code. And for those sort of following this issue, our cable code basically was established about 40 years ago and governs how cable providers operate within our city.As you well know, we have a changing regulatory environment in terms of who who regulates phone service and who or what body regulates the Internet service. This is dealing with cable providers. So the cable code sort of demonstrates how we treat cable providers and how they treat consumers such as yourself or Comcast or CenturyLink could be anexample. So the last time we've we've updated this cable code around 2002, so these updates that were really impressively done by our city departments and elected officials and members from the executive team and the council does a few things.Number one, it eliminates cable franchise district. And you may recall that prior to today we had five distinct districts and a cable provider would have one districts. And so by eliminating the districts, we're basically creating competition, allowing cable providers to basically build over one another such that you can have competition and competition and drive up quality, drivedown costs, drive down price. And this is a good thing for the city. We've allowed or encouraged cable providers to build out, put their capital, put their plans into different communities where they are not operating now. And that's how we get the competition that we want.We've enhanced the call answering standards in reporting. So in other words, when you call in, many of you have gotten on to what's called an IVR, an interactive voice response unit. And we've looked at the customer response time and how long it takes you to get a live body and put in some very stringent requirements, such asa call wait time has to be limited to 3 minutes that a customer service representative has to be on the phone within 30 seconds. So these are some very aggressive, aggressive customer service requirements. That we're now posing. If a cable operator are to provide cable service in the city of Seattle, we've restricted long term exclusive contracts inmulti-family dwellings or condominium units as an example, such that if you're a resident there and you can only have one service provider, we're making sure that that service provider can lock that customer into an exclusive contract, thereby giving the consumer choices.We've changed the name of one of our very important advisory boards, a Citizens Telecommunications and Technology Advisory Board Sea Tower, changing its name to the Community Technology Advisory Board, recognizing strongly that many of the people we provide service, many of the people here are not technical citizens in the literal or legal sense and could be undocumented persons. And we certainly serve many communities and this is a advisory board representing the entire community. The the amendments that I read in earlier was some great work done by Councilmember Lakota and other community activists, making sure that as we stimulate competition, that we're not forgetting our underserved, not forgetting areas where there could be underrepresented communities.And we are encouraging and measuring and requiring that these cable providers provide service in underrepresented communities. I've said at another forum that I look at digital literacy and access to the Internet is almost a human right that without it people cannot get education, they cannot apply for jobs, and it becomes a critical, necessary service.And as we look at cable opportunities, we want to encourage this kind of innovation neighbors, such that they can get cable, they can get audio, they can get Internet, etc.. So this is these are good amendments, I think.And certainly I appreciate that Councilmember La Carte is leadership in this regard. So there you have it. Our updated advisory code, I rather our cable code and I want to thank Martha Lester for her outstanding work and central staff and the members of Do It, the director, Michael Matt Miller.Tony Perez. I don't know if people know that we do have representatives in our department that are nationally known for protecting the rights of consumers, nationally respected. And thank you for your work on this work. And I hope the Council supports this legislation.Thank you. Questions or comments? Councilmember Liccardo and Councilmember Swan.I want to thank Casper Herrell for taking on this big task. You re revising and updating our cable communications ordinance and the code. As he rightly pointed out, there are a number of outdated elements that needed to really catch up to our obligations and the technology available to us today the most.And I also want to thank him for working with me in updating the amendments so that we really focused in on what significant. Basically reaching a significant portion of low income neighborhoods would be by tightening it up and saying that we wanted actual metrics and that we wanted quarterly reports.We then can feel confident that we can introduce competition between the companies but at the same time not have them cherry pick the more well off neighborhoods and ignore the poor neighborhoods. That's what's critical to this legislation, I believe.And so by having the cable companies come to the city with quarterly reports, we can assure that our lowest income neighborhoods will not be ignored and will receive adequate cable coverage. So thank you very much. Customer Help you work on this?Councilmember So on.Thank you, President Burgess and I thank council members Harlan Legato for their comments. As we would all agree, price gouging by cable companies, as you know, has reached a legendary status. And anybody who doctor will tell you that it is a real issue, not just in Seattle, but in every jurisdiction around the country.And any move to reduce the monopoly powers of these companies and to reduce prices is a step in the right direction. However, I'm generally against deregulation of cable companies that are already engaging in this egregious gouging. And I don't think that by itself, removing the regulation on the so-called cable districts will be sufficient to inspire the sortof competition that we're talking about, that we need to end monopolies that plague our city. And in reality, to do that, we will need to directly build municipal broadband. And I don't think that bribing cable cable companies with sweetheart deals is a solution.Having said that, I think a very strong amendment was introduced, you know, by council members to go down hard and thanks to all the consumer rights activist and technology activists who pushed for that amendment. I think that while I don't think that this will by itself result in competitiveness that we want, it does the amendment does addressthe problem of cherry picking customers, and that exacerbates the digital divide. And I supported the amendment. And with that amendment, I support the bill. If that amendment hadn't been there, I would have voted no. There's some good consumer protection.Improvements have been introduced in the bill, for example, requiring a live person on the phone no more than three after no more than 3 minutes of automated response. I think everybody will agree that that is a good thing.It's very frustrating to have automated phone conversations where your problems are not being addressed, but I also think that a lot is being left to directors rules. I mean, what happens if a cable corporation does not meet its low income requirements?I think the job of future councils is to ensure that the Office of Cable Communications monitors compliance and imposes penalties on cable corporations that fail to comply with the requirements of the amendment that was introduced. Just to let everyone know the language of the amendment, says the Office of Cable Communications, may also impose penalties for grantees failureto comply with the additional requirements. So I think that language will have to be strengthened in the future if we see failure to comply. But I will support the bill given the amendment. Thank you.Are there questions or comments? Councilmember Harrell.I'll make some comments. I think that with support, I'm not sure. But in any event, it should be crystal clear. What we smartly did was we reserve the right for us, the Office of Cable Communications, to decide whether this these investors, these cable providers are investing in our communities.Another route could have been we didn't reserve that unilateral or unilateral right to make that determination. And again, we have national experts on making sure we protect the rights of the underrepresented. So I think that was outstanding negotiation and good legislation.We regulate cable television, not broadband, not fiber, not Internet in terms of Internet connectivity. So this is not dealing with, for example, the telephone service, which is regulated by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission. So this is something we have control over.And I think, again, the spirit of this legislation is to to do exactly to create competition, not to comply with monopolies. We don't want monopoly. And I sort of tried to give the context that the whole spirit of this are to have multiple entries.And I would agree with Councilmember Stewart. So we don't want a monopoly in any of these providers. And that's the intent and that's the clear language of this legislation. And so I do ask for your support.Thank you. Will the clerk please call the roll on council? Bill 118347 as amended.Clark I got in.Harrell, I.Licata, I. O'Brien Hi Rasmussen. I so want President Burgess High eight in favor. None opposed.The bill passes and the chair will sign it.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nGood evening, Madam Mayor and members of the City Council community members. I'm Gayle Payne, Transportation Coordinator of the Public Works Department. This item before you is a staff recommendation to join and participate in the U.S. Department of Transportation.Mayor's Challenge for Safer Streets. Safer People. Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety Initiative. The challenge is a yearlong effort and begins on March 12th with a kick off event. And it requires the city to make a public statement about the importance of bicycling and walking.It also requires us to form a task force and to take part in seven challenge activities that are shown up there on your screen. The first one is to take a complete street approach. The second one is to remove barriers for all road users.The third to collect data on bicycling and walking. The fourth to use best practices designs. Fifth, to implement bicycling and walking improvements with maintenance projects like resurfacing. And six out of the seven is to improve the laws and regulations.And the last one is to educate and enforce road user behavior, working with the police department on that one. We're really fortunate in the timing of this challenge because the Public Works Department is just embarking on an update, a required update of both the pedestrian plans and the bicycle plan.So we can easily fold this effort, this national effort, into our local effort that's required to update these plans. And we can use this as a national best practices checklist. And so we will be starting the work scopes of those updates next month.And so we don't foresee too much additional staff work on that on this effort at all. The questions and comments. I remember Ashcraft.Thank you. Thank you for that update. I. I thought, too, when I read this and I know it was recently added to the agenda because we just got this information. But I thought it was great timing because we're just about to do the ribbon cutting on this fabulous shorelines cycle track project.And I was just at a workshop that you led last week on the Cross Alameda Trail. And. But I did have the question in my notes about how much additional staff work and time and resources would be necessary.But it sounds like. What did you say that that Public Works is about to embark on.That we're about to embark on on required updates for the bicycle plan? Okay. That was and also the pedestrian plan to the bicycle plan was update was back in 2010. So it's required every five years. And then the pedestrian plan was back in 2009.Okay. And and I would just like to say that I would certainly want to see Miss Payne as a key member of this effort, because she is so knowledgeable and has been at the forefront of some really great projects we've been doing for bicycles and pedestrians in Alameda.And I think you did mention the police department because that was also my thought about the educating and enforcing proper road behavior would need to get law enforcement in on that. So other than that, I think this is really exciting.It's timely, and I think Alameda could be a good leader in this in this effort. So thank you for bringing this to us.Any other member comments?Up the nation.So I personally would like us to do this. However, I want to clarify my understanding that we can do as much as we can do. There are some things that would have to the issuing the public statement. My understand that does have to happen and then forming the look.The top three are things that I think are supposed to happen and then you do as much of the challenge activities as you can. You're not expected. You don't have to do them all. And it's not as so they'll be following up and seeing if we in fact are able to do all of these, but that wetry to we try and we do balance depending upon CASM, whatnot. But the top three issue, a public statement about the importance of bicycle pedestrian safety, form the local action team, and then take local action through challenge activities.So, yes, I do understand. We do need a motion to do this.Moved.Well, okay, it's has been settled because I want some clarification about what it is we're voting on.So that we can sign up as it actually says. One of the steps to signing up mayor or a top elected official has or gets approval or and support from their city or jurisdiction to join the challenge. So I think we do.When when I read that, I think we do need council approval to sign up.Yes, I agree that we need council's approval. I would certainly not want to see us limiting our goals before we've even begun, because I, quite frankly, think we're capable of doing all of them. So I think you you start out and you set your sights high.And I think I have a feeling we've already done more than three of these and, you know, probably aren't that far away from doing all seven. So I think Alameda is equal to the challenge. Let's do it all.So we have a motion to the motion members.I just wanted a quick comment, you know, kind of second. What was their second to the motion? No, I'll do that. But then also I continue my comment. Councilmember Asker We can't just say we're going to do this and give lip service, do that to this.And you know, the mayor make a statement. Yeah, I commit to this, blah, blah, blah. You know, we want to have safe, convenient roads and then we don't do anything about it. It just seems kind of kind of silly if if we're not going to actually go, you know, full in 100% of this.We have emotion a second. Any other comments? All those in favor, I suppose, and passes unanimously. Thank you very much. And now we have City Manager Communications.None this evening.Oral communications, not agenda. We don't have anymore. No council referrals.Oh, sorry. Oh, sorry. Yes, sorry. We missed this.Came in.Carol Goldstein, City resident I just had a question because that was on the last slide. It was about the transportation plant. It said that it was to make streets better for not just bikes and pedestrians, but also personal mobility devices.\nReasoning:",

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nNo objection. The agenda is indeed adopted will be on in our agenda to reconsideration of Council. Council Bill Vetoed by Mayor Harrell. This is reconsideration of Council Bill 120325 for the clerk. Please read item one into the record.Agenda Item one Constable 120 325 relating to housing and displacement mitigation. Expanding the information required for submission under the Rental Registration Section Ordinance for rental housing units requiring submission of rental housing related information and amending Chapter 20 2.2.1 for sale.Mr. CODE.Thank you. I am calling up the reconsideration of Council Bill 120325 to consider passage of the Bill and the Mayor's veto. On May 31st, 2022, the Seattle City Council passed one to Council Bill 120325. Mayor Harrell subsequently vetoed it on June 10th, 2022.Today will be voted on whether to pass the bill again to override the veto. It takes six votes to pass the bill and override the mayor's veto. Council members received a memo from central staff who received a couple of them last Wednesday outlining the procedure for this vote.Following the comments, I reached the Council bill 1 to 0 325 is now pending before the council. Are there any comments on the bill? Councilor Peterson.Thank you. Council President, I appreciate the co-sponsorship of this bill with Councilmember Morales. And as you mentioned, a majority of the city council approved council bill 120325 to collect basic rental data. City Hall has been lacking for years.Data we need urgently now on the eve of considering massive land use and zoning changes through a required comprehensive plan. As one of the sponsors of the bill, I outlined several reasons to support the bill originally. We need the data to prevent displacement of vulnerable residents.The data is vital before we make these changes to the comprehensive plan that impacts zoning and housing policies. The current census tract data and rental surveys on vacant units lack the vital details on existing rents at specific locations, and we already considered alternatives to this bill.But those alternatives are inadequate. The data can validate affordable benefits of smaller mom and pop landlords. Also in deference to active landlords who expressed concerns about the concept, the bill already included important accommodations. A research university would receive the raw rental data instead of the city government directly.The requirement would sunset in three years, so it was just a temporary bill needed at a crucial time in our decision making. Opponents of the bill then raised concerns about timing and cost. The bill was amended further, which ended up addressing those concerns.The city, the city's executive departments would be in the driver's seat. Nothing would happen until the executive executes a contract with a research university. After a competitive request for proposals and the RFP could help manage the costs. Specifically, the Council adopted was amended to state that effective three months from the date of their excuse me, effective threemonths from the date the contract described in the subsection is executed. The information that was requested will be submitted later, twice annually. So the timing issue was solved with that. I also want to point out that in between the bill was vetoed and offered additional supports for the bill.And bottom line is, I urge at least one of the four council members who voted against it to join the majority. So this bill becomes law. The additional supports are that rental registries like this are increasingly common in the United States.Seattle is behind. We are not progressive on this issue. Long standing laws requiring rent roles with rental data information already exist in other cities such as New York City. Moreover, many California cities have implemented these programs over the past few years.A 2019 report examined eight rental housing registry programs, including three that already require the rent amount to be provided. A more recent February 2022 news article highlighted that 16 different cities in California are moving ahead with this, not waiting for the state legislature to act.Costs are dramatically lower than what opponents claimed based on the actual experiences of these other cities. The fact that we're simply adding on to an existing housing registry, Seattle's rental registration and inspection ordinance that already enforces the collection of data.And we would be using a competitive request for proposals. The cost to add the collection of research components at CB 120325 could be as low as $125,000 a year. The two departments that should want this data and want us to have this data.They received budget increases last year and the executives required to have this information in doing the comprehensive plan proposals. So this bill would have enabled them to get the data they need and the university that would be chosen via a competitive RFP would be doing the bulk of the work, the data entry, the sorting and the mapping, the existing affordable housing projects, so that we make well-informed decisions. There was a $2 million estimate. That was over the three year period, and it was based on asking one real estate center how much money would they want to do this?And that is not necessarily the best way to get an affordable result. The competitive IRP process would get that resolved. There was also a $5 million estimate that was mentioned, but that was if we were to set up the brio program from scratch.So that was not a reliable estimate. Also, this bill did not charge landlords the cost to run this system. Landlords do pay for the RPO already. There could have been an option to increase that by $4 a unit that would have yielded plenty of funds to run this program.But we didn't choose to do it that way. But we could have. In other words, cost was really not an appropriate rationale to vote against the bill, in my opinion. So bottom line is there are plenty of reasons to support Council 1 to 0 3 to 5 as the majority of our legislative branch already did.So I urge a yes vote again today. Thank you.Thank you. Councilor Petersen, before I go to Councilor Morales, who is a co-sponsor, then then it'll be customers to watch. I want to remind the public, when we voted on this on May 31st, the vote was 5 to 4.All right, Councilman Morales. I hear you. Yeah, we go. Sorry about that. It's you, colleagues. And thank you, Councilmember Peterson. I'm proud to have co-sponsored this legislation. And I'm disappointed that the mayor decided to veto a bill that would actually allow us to collect real information on rent trends for the first time ever.As the city continues to become more affordable. We as policymakers need data about our rental market that tell us the rate at which rent is increasing in our city. And we shouldn't be reliant on private, for profit corporations to do that work for us.We know that Seattle isn't affordable, but we don't really know the rate at which rents are skyrocketing right now. We don't. We don't know which units are seeing the biggest increases. We don't know if there is a ceiling to the kind of rent increases that we're seeing right now.My office worked with Councilmember Peterson on this legislation because we believe that it has the potential to provide us at the city with data that we're currently lacking. And it has the potential excuse me.I mean.It has the potential to put a tremendous amount of power into the hands of tenants, shifting the scale towards something more balanced between landlords and tenants. This is an opportunity that tenants in cities with rent roles like Chicago and New York already have.This could mean for tenants that they finally have the ability to make an informed decision and to make a choice between units when they're searching for a new home, something that landlords have been able to do with background checks on tenants for decades.What this means for tenants is that they'll actually know who's hiding behind LLC that owned the LLC, that owned their building. And that means that they can go directly to the person or persons who are responsible for keeping their unit habitable.If repair requests are not being fulfilled. This also means for tenants that they can have data that once and for all definitively shows the need for us to join the rest of the West Coast and pass rent control at the state and the city level.And finally, this means for tenants that we would finally have concrete data that dispels the illusion that private market trickle down economics is the solution to our affordability crisis. Data that could give us the extra push to invest in high quality, abundant, publicly.Owned social housing.So for me, this legislation isn't necessarily about land use decisions that may or may not happen in the next two years. It's about nothing short of giving tenants the opportunity to stay in Seattle, something that we know many of them are losing quickly.I urge my colleagues to vote yes to override this shortsighted veto and to give tenants the opportunities that they deserve. If you can spare Morales customers who want. Thank you. Guns in prison worries, as I said when this first came for a vote to the city council.This bill simply requires landlords to disclose the rent they charge so that policymakers can have accurate, objective data.Be clear.This bill going into effect will not make rental homes more affordable. It will simply collect data. But it is outrageous that the landlord lobby, who claimed to charge affordable rents, have called repeatedly to public comment in the past in opposition, the city having objective data.It would be good to have more data about the rent landlords charge and it is ironic that landlords have simultaneously claimed that they charge low rent and objected to actually disclosing the rent they charge. It is extremely telling that the landlord lobby has joined out in opposition to this bill.Several speakers before and during public comment today said if landlords are not gouging their tenants, why are they so afraid to tell the truth about their rents? And it is frankly scandalous that Mayor Harold chose to use a real veto.Do so brazenly do the bidding of the landlord lobby. More accurate and more complete data will help further confirm what every renter in Seattle already knows that landlords and the predatory real estate markets are gouging renters with totally unconscionable rent hikes.The cost of housing is being set by the greed of speculative banks, private equity funds and rapacious property management corporations rather than what it actually costs to house people. While the real estate barons make billions, working people and the poor are increasingly priced out just to have a roof over their heads or they're being pushed into homelessness. We need to strengthen all.Aspects of renters rights. Including strong citywide rent control and a big increase in the Amazon tax to file and increase expansion of publicly owned social housing. This bill will only provide more accurate and objective data, so if councilmembers do not support it, it would not stop renters from fighting for rent control.However, any councilmember.Who claims to be data driven has.No excuse to oppose this bill. I vote yes to make.Landlords disclose the rent.They charge.Thank you.If you castmembers talent. And finally, we have Councilmember Herbold. Thank you. Just trying to adjust my. There we go.I'm taking the opportunity.To address the need for this sensible data collection legislation. And I, too, am scratching my head over. Why the powerful tool of.A male.Veto would be used for a bill that is really again, it's merely a data collection tool that is really helpful to us as policymakers, whether or not it's on the council side of the of the aisle or on the executive side.I want to just uplift how we've used data in the past, data specifically about displacement to guide our decisions. Back in 2015, that was the first major comprehensive plan update that actually included it for the first time ever a displacement risk analysis.This displacement risk analysis was instrumental to council's deliberations on the mandatory housing affordability reasons, and it helped guide us.On.How to how to use the the ABS zoning tool to add more housing and collect funds to build affordable housing. And it was really, again, a tool that used data that helped drive our decisions. You may recall that.On April 5th, the City Council received.I think, an a really important bit of guidance from the Seattle Planning Commission related specifically to our next major update.And in that memo, they.Wrote that they believe the Seattle Planning Commission believes we should make displacement policies focus of the next comprehensive plan to drop aid to the equitable growth patterns that led portion proportionate displacement of bipoc and low income communities and draw up the comprehensive and expected in 2024 needs to include displacement policies as a central focus of the plan. The city should.Supplement knowledge shared by communities affected by displacement, with improved data tracking of high displacement risk areas and the outcomes of policy actions. I really hope that we can override his veto with a majority +166 councilmembers voting in favor today.And I just want to close out her remarks was saying just a little bit of the call to action from the cities this weekend. They encouraged us by saying, let's catch up with other progressive cities and better understand where all affordable housing is located in Seattle.So we can finally have the detailed data we need to prevent economic displacement as we update our cities policies for a better future. Thank you. Councilmember Herbold, before we go to a vote, Councilmember Peterson, or anything you want to say before I make a few comments?Oh.You're good. Yeah. Okay, so let me read again the instructions and then we'll go to a vote. The City Council will now vote to reconsider passage of Council Bill 120325. And to either override or sustain the mayoral veto.Jerry Roll Call. Council members will vote I or yes to pass the bill and override the mayor's veto. Or vote no not to pass the bill and sustain the veto. If the vote on the motion does not receive six votes, the bill fails and the veto is sustained.If the vote on the motion is six or more favors in favor, the bill passes, the veto is overridden, and all provisions within the bill go into effect. There any other questions, any other procedural questions on the vote before we go?So as a reminder, council members will either vote I to pass the bill and override the mayor's veto or no to not pass the bill and sustain the veto or the clerk. Please call the roll on the passage of Council Bill 120325 and consideration of the Mayoral Veto.Madam Clerk.Council Member. Silent. Yes. Councilmember Strauss.No.Councilmember Herbold? Yes.

The item before you tonight is really just a status report on our ongoing effort to manage Parklets and the next steps for the Commercial Streets program.We will be coming to the council at a in the next couple of months with an actual contract for what we described in the staff report. So the actual decision making and voting really will be occurring when you authorize the money for the next step in the project.But we wanted to give you an update on where we are at and the direction we were headed. So that was really the purpose of tonight's report. I think Mr. Ransome myself are here to answer any questions you might have about those next steps.Perfect. Well, Councilmember Harry Spencer pulled this item in some way to turn the floor over to her Councilmember Herr Spencer. Thank you, Mayor. I don't have any questions. I just have comments. So I'm happy to actually thank staff for their comprehensive report of this item.I have thought that we should follow what other jurisdictions, some other jurisdictions are doing in regards to having payrolls for the parklets and not as opposed to decorative concrete barriers that are the reason I want I want to commend staff because they were very forthright in saying that, yes, in fact, the corrals are not only less expensivethan the anticipated cost is almost the approximately $200,000 difference at the corrals or less, while also acknowledging that the crews are safer. And so I appreciate that that's my position. So I will not be voting for this. I think it's critical that especially when we can save money, $200,000, that that be made very clear that rather thandoing something that is safer and less money, the recommendation of the council's direction has in fact been to do something that provides less safety and at a higher cost. So I will be voting no for this.Thank you.Okay. Kelso, Woodside.Well, I appreciated the staff analysis indicating K rails are safer and and less expensive. So to me, I think I would rather just adopt the K rails as opposed to the, the what the, the, the alternative. So I'll, I'll move adoption of this with the proviso that that we pursue k rails and kiwirail's in place of thethe the what's on the table.Okay. And let's hear from what did you want to second that Councilmember Harry Spencer. Okay. Is that decorative, concrete barriers? And then I see Councilmember Enough hands up. Councilmember That's why.I.Know we have our our city engineer on the line. And I believe that the misrepresentation of what the staff report says about safety, I think needs to be clarified. I'll ask it is a leading question. My understanding is that it is the position of the engineers about who are in charge of safety on our streets, that theproposed decorative barriers are actually just as safe at 25 miles an hour and provide the level of safety as necessary and the rails which are designed to tip for freeway medians. In terms of the level of say that many in most cities don't aren't even putting barriers out, let alone decorative ones.And Mr. Vance may be calling you to comment.Thank you, Madam Chair. City Council Members. Yes, it is our position that the these concrete barriers to provide a satisfactory level of safety to protect the the parklets. We haven't done a side by side comparison of the rail versus the the concrete barriers, but my research has shown that they do provide the protection that we're providing thatwe're asking for.Whether they get it at speeds above 25 miles per hour.I don't have crash data that shows exactly how these two would perform side by side. So I can't make it. I can't. I mean, that was. We haven't done testing to show that. But I mean. But we've determined that these are safe for the conditions that are on the street today.Thank you. Councilor Harris Spencer.And then if I could.Sorry.I guess I was going to say I won't be supporting the motion simply because I believe that almeida's actually even with these decorative concrete, more decorative, nicer looking concrete barriers is going far and above what most cities in our in the Bay Area are doing for Parklets.And also that I think designing our downtown business district so that they look like freeway medians would be a problem. And since we're doing this as a place, a way to kind of increase the placemaking on Park Street in Webster Street and the increase in them being a place where people want to be.I fully support the staff recommendation.Thank you.Thank you, Carlos, from the site. Back to you, Councilmember Hurst. Let's hear from Mr. Thomas. Mr. Thomas.I just from a process perspective, we don't need a motion. We don't need direction at this point. I think what I'm hearing, though, is we have to come back. Our plan is to, first of all, come up with a striping barricade plan.Then we can cost it out. Then we bring it to council to contract out for a single contractor to buy the barricades for us and place them for us and do the necessary striping of the striping on the street.So we plan on coming back. But I think, you know, if you would like what we can do is come back with a contract proposal that prices both options and the council can make that decision at that time.Just one quick point that I think we I hope we emphasize in the staff report, I can't remember a while ago we wrote the staff report visiting with the business community, talking to all the businesses. There was a feeling of the current situation with the water filled barricades and just the appearance made.The entire street, particularly on Park Street, look a little bit like a construction zone. And the Kay Rails, everybody felt the highway corrals will perpetuate that for another two years. So the decorative concrete from a bit from the business's perspective and I think from staff's perspective, we felt like since the goal of this program is to supportour business community, help them survive through COVID and out of COVID, this this concern about trying to make Park Street look a little bit more uniform, less of a construction zone for the next two years. So that's why we were recommending the decorative.But at the end, all we can do is we can price them both out, bring them both forward for the final contract. And the council can make the decision at that point whether you want to do the more expensive rails or the or the the less expensive excuse me, less expensive rail versus the more expensive decorative.The other option is you can tell us right now. Don't come back with that other option. And just we just want one option. And you can determine right now what that option might be.And I like the sound of your approach because what we're hearing, Spencer Then I have a thought and then decide and then I have good council rehearsed back there, so I would just like to read from a staff report.That's why I want to commend staff for being forthright about this, the safety issue in the report. And it does say from a safety perspective, staff believes the decorative concrete barriers provide a significant increase in safety and esthetic improvement over the current water filled barriers, which is great, although a K rail is heavier and would provide additionalcollision protection from staff's perspective, that extra protection is not needed for a street with a 25 mile per hour speed limit. My position is that safety is the most important when we have an accident and we have had accidents here in town.You can go out and you can see the areas where they've been hit. We've been fortunate that we haven't had people being injured. However, not every city or jurisdiction has been so lucky. And so for me, safety is, in fact, the most important.And I appreciate the esthetics and other cities do, too, that do have rules. And what they have done is they painted them. They decorated them to blend in or put planters on one side of them versus the other to try to address that.That city throughout the state and I believe Fremont in Northern California from my research is using the K Rail. So I appreciate being able to share that. And I do like the staff being upfront about the safety issue.Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Desai.Thank you. I just want to say overall in I'm incredibly supportive of the program on Park Street and Webster Street. I know, you know, people are concerned about, you know, the reduction of the to two lanes in one direction, two lanes in the other direction to one lane in one direction.But but I really do feel it slows things down and it does make life a lot more enjoyable on the on on either street. And and I will say, you know, I think just more information.I think would be great.You know, I think the mayor, for example, raised, you know, what if. How does it how does the decorative barrier hold up at maybe 30 miles per hour or 35 miles per hour? If we could just get more information, that would be great.So, you know, I could be convinced to support the decorative. So but, you know, I think what the planning director had suggested is just, you know, holding off, bring more back, more information, I think is a thought is I can live with that.So I if we pursue that that direction, I'm more than happy to withdraw my motion.Okay. Well, I would side with you on that. And what I just wanted to add is that cost isn't my primary consideration, it is safety followed by a statics. And the the thing about, you know, noting that this is a street with a 25 mile an hour speed limit.I think we all know that most of our streets have a 25 mile per hour street speed limit, but unfortunately, people exceed the speed limit and sometimes terrible things happen. And we have had on Park Street twice the same Parkland has been hit.And mercifully, one time the most recent was after hours and nobody was there. But the first time people were injured, not seriously. But I so what I would love is to pursue the planning director and with the city engineer's input, obviously suggestion that they just come back with those comparisons and side by side of the cost, thebenefit and maybe they really are comparable. And so, you know, here we've got the data to go with one over the other. But I think at this point, I just you know, I think we do have to do our street designs with the understanding in mind that not everybody is a law abiding driver.And we but we just want to protect people. I do like the program. So. So Councilmember, they said, what's your pleasure?I'll withdraw my motion and take up planning director Andrew Thomas's suggestion as to how he will proceed and will look for more information.Just to persist after action. Okay, so good counsel, everybody. Nodding heads, casual remarks. Wait, your.Thoughts?I think it's great. At the end of the day, we can I mean, we could remove cars that would be the safest. I don't see anybody. It's but again, everything can always be safer. The question we need to ask is, does it add and does it provide an adequate, good faith effort for safety?We have people driving up on the side under crosswalks and sidewalks all the time. We're not building concrete barriers at the car, at the at those intersections where people are driving under the sidewalks. So I think, you know, it's our engineers say.The question shouldn't be how can we go even further? The question should be, ah, is it safe enough? And for me, that's the that is the analysis I'll be looking for.Okay. Well, we'll look forward to deciding coming back to us. Thank you so much, Mr. Thomas and Mr. Vance, as always. Okay. Thank you. Okay. And moving down the alphabet, we go next to item five H. Madam Kirk, would you introduce that one for us and why you're introducing it, city manager or whomever?Would you please bring the annex team in on this? These are the CFOs, right? Okay. Go ahead. Or will we? I don't think Mr. Thomas and Mr. Vance, are they.Yeah, we're both bringing the people here. Talk it out.Yeah, we can. Public works director. We can ship everybody away.Yeah.

Meet yourself to do that. Yeah. And there she is. Hello.Do you need. I can. I can just keep a brief overview of this item. This is to adopt a memorandum, an extension of the current memorandum of understanding with the International Association of Firefighters. What this item does, it extends the term an additional two years.The firefighters will not receive an increase this year. In 2021, they would have been eligible for a 2% increase. They will not receive that increase. But during the extension in.2022 and.2023, they will receive 2%.So it extends it for the additional two years. So for a three year term. Say. Thank you, Miss Bernstein. Why don't we? Unless there are clarifying questions about the staff report, let's hear from our public speakers and then we'll go back to public to council.Comment. Are there any clarifying questions? Okay, so let's take our public speakers, please.Kirk Van Kearney.Kevin Brady. Good evening, Mr. Kearney.Hello, Mayor de Council. Nice to see you all. Existing contract with the IAF Local 689 does not expire until December 18th, 2021. The uncertainty with regards to the economy and the effects of COVID 19 on the city budgets provides too many variables when considering the renegotiation of a labor contract that has one year remaining.In my opinion, the prudent financial option is to wait and see how the coming months events unfold before discussing a new contract. Our business, community and citizens have suffered severe financial damage. The possibility of continued curfews and shutdowns is likely as the COVID 19 crisis has spiked again.The state in some cities, as well as numerous private companies, including those in our business community, have laid off workers and curtailed business activities. There is a real possibility that our city could also be forced to invoke pay cuts and layoffs.Engaging in a negotiation with only one bargaining unit, especially one that comprises a large percentage of the city's payroll and not all of the city employees is not prudent, nor is it fair to the other bargaining groups. The city and its residents are truly in this together.Now is not the time to negotiate a separate deal with IMF f 689. Thank you.Thank you, Mr. Kearney. And our next speaker.Trish Herrera. Spencer. Former mayor.Mr. Spencer. Good evening.Anything. Can you hear me now?Yes, that's fine. Okay. Great. Thanks.I wanted to also speak to this item. My concern that I would be echoing Kevin Kearney, the Treasurer. I believe we're out of the sorry and I'm back. When I was on council I had voted against this as had member decent.And at this point, I believe it's appropriate that we do not grant the extension. It is a serious matter if you look at the cumulative raises that the Firefighters Association have received under this contract. It is actually 20.7% since 2000 for 2014, which is very significant.I think the staff's report should have included that. I would have liked to have seen a breakdown of the annual raises for the firefighters, as well as their supposed to be a compensation that was supposed to happen in 2020.There's no update on that. There was also I think there should have been a link to the current contract. And in regards to the fiscal health in the staff report, it shares of savings at 174,000. That does not speak to.The.Additional two years of the 2%. I think it's very likely we will be asking once again all departments to have some savings. And there doesn't appear to be. And this seems to put the firefighters association in front. And I also want to share that if you listen to the transcript, if you look at the transcript from thegrand jury, we the conversation with the former city manager that in fact, shares a comment by a member to request a short extension or something of the firefighters contract, which is interesting that that's what's appearing to be happening.Also, if you look at the recent contributions to member Ody and member Bella's campaigns for the their last campaigns, you will see. This is old information, I think, but it was approximately 30,000 from our Firefighters Association to member of this campaign and almost 23,000 to remember Bella's campaign, which is by far the largest donors.The next ones are like 70 $500. So I actually think they should consider recusing themselves from the vote on this. Thank you.Thank you, Mr. Spencer. Our next speaker.Jay Garfinkel.Mr. Garfinkel, good evening.Good evening. I have a few concerns, some of which have already been shared by Ms.. Spencer. One is that the firefighters contract, which is extremely generous, is playing a significant part in the city's financial budget woes. And I think that we should not be too quick to make it even more generous.We have I don't believe there's been any comment from the Treasurer or auditor and what the financial impact will be. It appears that the financial impact will be to increase the debt or relative debt of the city. And I think we should have the expert comment from our two elected financial.People. I was concerned that the City Council participated in the drafting of the memorandum by virtue of sitting in on the closed session and then giving direction to the city manager. I'm also concerned regarding the campaign contributions that were received by two of the members, as was just pointed out.And I believe that's patently a conflict of interest. And the city attorney doesn't seem to have any concerns about conflicts of interest these days. So I think that both Councilmember Odean, Councilmember Vella should recuse themselves from any voting.I also think it should be put off until next year as the first speaker recommended. There is absolutely no urgency in taking action on this issue tonight. Thank you.Thank you, Mr. Garfinkel. Next, public speaker Harman Reed. Is right. Good evening. Good evening.And. And thank you very much, Madam Mayor. And City Council members. I would just like to echo what Mr. Spencer and Mr. Garfinkel stated, and I respectfully request that Council Member Odie and Councilmember Bella recuse themselves from this from this vote based on the the contributions that they received for their for their campaigns.Thank you.Thank you, Mr. Reed. Our next speaker.We have no more speakers.Okay. And do we have council comments and questions? Councilmember Vela, I see your hand up, followed by Councilmember Odie, followed by Councilmember Dave and Councilmember Vela.So, you know, first of all, I would recommend that any incoming member to the City Council get acclimated with and familiar with our council handbook, which we passed while that person was not on city council. Second of all, I would like to ask.There were some allegations raised essentially during the comments, and I'd like to hear from our city attorney about the conflict of interest. There also seems to be some misinformation. There are requirements that we report. Any in-kind contributions. Whether or not we have any control over those things does not make them a monetary contribution.I'd also like to find out. So I'd like to hear from our city attorney on that. And then I'd also like to wonder, Mr. Garfinkel is a top donor to Councilmember De Saag and to Ms.. Spencer. And so whether or not they need to recuse themselves from similar votes.Thank you.So, Mr. May. May I call on you next?Of course. With respect to the question about conflict of interest, there is no state or local law requirement that mandates that council members.Recuse just because they receive.Campaign contributions. And that is a longstanding and black letter law. Council members could choose voluntarily to recuse on any number of things, and that's beyond what we.Would be recommending. But in terms of.Legal requirements, state law does not require recusal based on campaign contributions, and neither does local law.And not a mayor. There was there was also a statement made about council writing the staff report, if we could hear from the staff. I wasn't involved in drafting the staff report, so I'd like to hear from staff about that.Maybe the MRU, but yeah, I could.Yeah, I can.Mr. Leavitt is your Eric Leavitt, please?Yeah, I can. I can address both. I can address that. And also just expand to make sure people are well aware of what's in the contract or what's in the what before the council tonight. So no city council member was involved and no see as far as the drafting of the staff report.So obviously in negotiation with the firefighters union, I had to go for direction to the city council in closed session and that was our involvement of the city council and no city council member or city council as a whole had any involvement in it.Other than that, I want to lay out just so to make sure people are understand because I got some emails which confused me a little bit when I read the contract. I was trying to understand how the email related to the contract, but this extension would be a two year extension.If I could just explain real quick to make sure the public understands it's a two year extension.That's very helpful. I appreciate it.Okay. It's a two year extension right now. They are scheduled to receive a 2% increase based on the salary survey survey on January of 2021. So that's in about one month from today. And with this extension, if approved by the city council tonight, that 2% would become a 0%.So that's worth $174,000 savings for the fiscal year. And about $348,000 savings for a calendar year would occur. That 2% would then go into the following year. So for what was a 2% this year would not become a 2% until 2022, not 2021.And so the reason for the action today or the action before January one of 2021, is that once the increase goes in, then it would become a take back and there would be a different type of negotiation that council would have to do with the firefighters at that time.So the increases with the two year extension as as shown is about 4% over the three years. So over the last year of the contract and two years of extension would be about a 4% versus the average that the firefighters have received, which I think one of the speakers I did did refer to was about a 3.2%per year for the previous six years. So this is a 4% over three years. Collectively, for the entire three years, it's a 4% versus the average of about a little over 3% per year. Prior to this, I think I thought that that was something that was a fair deal.And I felt the firefighters also deferred this year's increase, which actually doesn't even factor into that. What I just said, in addition that we didn't even put into the financials, is that they do pay between two and 4%.In addition on their pension and in what's before the council tonight, they would continue to pay that for the two year extension, which if this was not approved tonight, we would have to renegotiate that in one year from now.So that's not even projected in the financial savings to the city, but that is a assumed financial savings also within the contract.Thank you, Mr. Levitt. Councilor, are you finished? And then. Okay, so then we're going to Councilmember Ody and then to you. Councilmember Desai.Thank you, Madam Mayor. I mean. Mr. City Manager So that to the fore that was on top of the 11 that were allowed by maximum law. So I mean, it's really between 13 and 15% of their salary for pension, right?Right. It's over and above the regular percentage. That is.Correct. And then there's also a contribution of 4% for OPEB that the bargaining unit is contributing that continues for another two years in this contract as well. Correct.I'll let the h.r. Director speak to.That. That that's correct. They are paying.The additional.6% toward hers and then in addition, another 4 to 4% to the OPEB liability. And that is what I continue.With this in your I'm going to ask just for the benefit of the lay audience that might not deal in these acronyms as often as we do. Just tell us what personnel are you referring to them, if you would, please respond to that.Yes.So for the retirement system, the oh, our public safety pay an additional amount as a portion of what the employer would pay. They contribute to that. So they pay 6% toward the employer's contribution.And then separately from that, we are setting.Aside money to pay down future cost, and that is the OPEB trust. And they pay between two and 4% into that trust as part of their contribution.Thank you.And then the prize is the public employee retirement system. Public employee record. The OPEB is the other other post-employment benefits.CARLSON There was another provision in the current contract, something called the Breather Balanced Revenue Index, which created a floor and a ceiling for increases based on how well the city's financial performance was. And that's taken out of this two year extension, isn't that correct?That's correct.So for 2021, then they're forgoing a 2% increase and getting a 0%. That correct?Yes.That's correct. How much is how much are other bargaining units getting as an increase in 2021, the same year that the firefighters are taking a 0% increase?The other firefighter group will receive 2%. And then.Our public park police.Officers, it's based on a salary survey, will receive four and a half and then miscellaneous employees are 2%.Okay. So I appreciate that. Just a couple quick comments. It never ceases to amaze me that we have the you know, the haters of the firefighters come out whenever there's a contract. And I can never figure out why it is.I mean, is it because they save lives? Is it because they protect our property? Is it because, you know, when we have an arson string on Park Street, they respond quickly. So a whole block of of wooden buildings is not burned down.Is it because they risked their life and limb to in mutual aid to help the state while it's burning? Or is it because they exercise their First Amendment rights, First Amendment rights guaranteed in the Constitution of the United States?So, I mean, some day somebody, you know, I'm not going to be here much longer, but someday somebody will tell me, you know, what what what the problem is with firefighters, you know, is it that they do their job and they protect us and we don't like that?Or is it, you know, that, you know, they just decide on their off time to exercise their First Amendment rights and including and First Amendment rights is the right to make an in-kind contribution to a candidate of their choice that they've endorsed.And they've chosen to do that. And as Melissa, our councilmember Bella, but by the way, won the election going away, as she said, that's their right to do and we really have no control over it. So it's just kind of interesting.And I will point out that, you know, according to our charter, which I continue to read and reread, you know, the only response, the only qualification of an auditor is to be a CPA, and the only qualification for treasurer is to have investment experience.There is no requirement and maybe they have imputed on themselves some magical financial analysis powers that they're not required to have. But if I'm going to be listening to somebody's financial analysis, I will listen to our finance director and Eric Levitt, our city manager, and Jerry Bodin, our assistant city manager.So know this whole idea that, you know, campaign contributions are some time link. I mean, that that's the new standard we're going to have then. You know, I think when two people one person on council now and one that will be sworn in in two weeks decides to vote on anything related to tenants.You know, I think I'm going to be the first one in line that says you need to recuse yourself, because under your standard, if you receive campaign contributions, you're not allowed to take a vote on that. So we'll just see how far that works.So again, it just boggles my mind that there's so much angst over, you know, people that are protecting our city when, you know, they volunteered or offered to take a 0% increase during a COVID year when, you know, their fellow public safety officials are happy to take a 4.5% increase.So it is what it is. But, you know, I hope someday there's animosity towards the fire department and their hardworking employees goes away. I'll just say one last thing. I mean, it's a little bit weird for me to sit up here and have my ethics criticized by someone who accused of taking city funds and depositing it intheir bank account. But, you know, life is what it is.Thank you, Councilmember Odie. I'm going to ask our H.R. director, Nancy Bronstein, to comment, because I also don't want to pit one public safety group against another. I think that anyone who risked their life in the course of doing their job deserves the measure of respect.Ms.. Bronstein, could you explain to us why it is and I believe that the salary survey has something to do with the difference in the percentage increase that fire is seeing as compared to police. Yeah. Since Mr. Latte raised that.Is that the memo you are the the negotiated agreement with all four public safety units had this coming salary increase the January 21 salary increase is based on a salary survey. Those agreements identify what agencies will survey. So we look like agencies.And we did a survey and the language in the agreement said that the salary increase would be based on the survey and could be that it would be between two and 5%. So based on the survey results, so the police were four and a half percent below market.So they see that four and a half percent fire was not below market. So that's why they're receiving the 2%. So it's just.To.Equalize salaries.In fact, fire was above market, if I recall.I guess above market and place was below.Thank you for that clarification, Councilmember Desai.Thank you. Thank you very much. I pulled this item from the consent calendar largely because I wanted to do it as I think that the council ought to extend as a courtesy the CEO, the new incoming council member, an opportunity to officially participate in the vote on a topic that is a large part of the City ofAlameda budget. Granted, what's before us right now is about is about extending for two additional years a contract that will sunset on December 2021, I believe. So so that what's before us is specifically about the contract and extending the contract.But really, the topic, the subject for which this contract is being considered or for extension is a large part of our of our city hall operations. So for that for that reason, I it was my feeling that we should include the incoming councilmember.I do want to extend a heartfelt thank you to Councilmember o.T. I do know that, you know, with great passion that he's represented. Public service, public safety service. And I think for that, he should be thanked. And and no one, you know, should she should hold that against him.But I do think, though, that the subject matter, because it's a large part of our city hall budget, I think because there will be a new council member, that she should take part in that discussion. And that's why I pulled this.In terms of the substance of the agreement, there are actually some very good things within the extension. For example, not doing the BRI. I'm not going to go into the details of what the BRI is. But it was this way in which the rate the percentage increases was was calculated.And when you go into the details of it, you know, it resulted in these. Year in, year out kind of increases several years ago that cumulatively, in my opinion, as one of five council members was a slightly excessive.So I'm glad to see that the Brea formula is being stripped out so that that's actually a positive when it comes to this extension discussion. And it is also a positive that that there is a 0% increase, which is a misnomer.0% increase this coming year as one of the trade offs and a 2% in the following year. And that's a the 2% is a positive in relationship to the average that you heard earlier this evening. I think you heard an average of roughly 3.5% a year.You know, over time, cumulatively, that that added up. So what's so within the the the substance that's being discussed, there are actually some positives. But I think the larger issue, though, is that we should include the new incoming council member, Tricia Herrera Spencer, in this discussion, because this is a large part of City Hall and it willbe so going forward beyond the December 2021 sunset into the end of 2023. I suspect so. Okay. So that's why I pulled it.Thank you, Councilmember. Dislike for that explanation, Councilmember Vela.I appreciate that. However, I also inherited a bunch of contracts that were voted on fairly, but within a few months of me coming into office. So I think that, you know, we've seen this at the federal level, you know, Obama having to wait essentially and people filibustering Supreme Court appointments.I think that that we can go back and forth on this. My concern is that there there is a scheduled increase that they are due to get under the existing contract next month, I believe. And so there is a timing aspect to this.And sometimes, you know, those for those reasons, it's important to to know whether or not that we're going to be paying out the 2% or not and merely holding it up so that a new council member can vote on it might not be the most prudent thing because of the existing requirements of the contract.So for that reason, I think that we should move forward tonight as planned because we're going to get that savings and we need to be able to factor that in when we go into the midyear. And I, I would like I think staff also would like to know what we're doing.I think it's with our noticing requirements and everything else, if we waited, it would it would really put it down to the wire.Thank you. Councilmember Avella, Councilmember de SAG. You are welcome to make a motion to. To carry out your desire. I don't know if.You're.As is your right.I'll I'll move that we postpone this item until the first meeting in January 2021.All right. We've had a motion by Councilmember Desai. Do we have a second? I'm not seeing a second. So that motion dies for lack of a second. Any further comments, questions on this item? Counsel, you're still on the consent calendar.I see you're next.I'd just like to make one quick comment that I'd be happy to move to the staff recommendation.And I make my quick comment. Okay, go ahead.Gladly.Because I have a great idea. So my comment is that that this process is not something that just popped up and is being rushed through. It's been a part of council conversations. I believe we had two council meetings over the over the one over the summer and one in the early fall as well.This is the culmination of long conversations and negotiations and the idea that we would stop so that that we could possibly change course after all those good faith negotiations is a little disconcerting to me. I also just wanted to say that nobody else has acknowledged it.I wanted to just call out that. I think that the attacks on the integrity of our city attorney, especially given how factual and inappropriate they were, were uncalled for. And that I have I work with a lot of city attorneys in my job, and I have worked with a number of them here in this in the cityof Alameda as well. And I hold Mr. Shin very, very high regard, especially as it comes to ethics and following the law. And I think that it was just absolutely unconscionable to assume that he is somehow not care has turned a blind eye.The comments themselves, I think, really did call themselves out as being uninformed, and I will put that down to that. But I wanted to just offer my strong support for our city attorney because I think he does a fabulous job.So thank you for raising that point. I was taken aback by the speaker's suggestion that Mr. Shin doesn't care about conflict of interest. He follows the law. He's very knowledgeable about the law. Perhaps this council, moving forward in the next year, would like to entertain a conflict of interest, provision, ordinance, what have you.There's lots of lots of potential, I'm sure, but one of the things we talk about as a council are our responsibilities to the public when we're serving as council members and not to engage in ad hominem attacks on members of the public.There is not a handbook for the public, at least not not a written one. But I've often suggested that we would all do well to treat people the way we would like to be treated. And we can always elevate our discourse.And, you know, we don't all agree with each other, but for the most part, the council is able to communicate civilly with each other. And that's what I ask all of you, the five of us, that let's just keep it civil when we're talking.I know we get passionate and excited and let's set a good example for the public hopefully to follow. And I do want to thank all of our staff for their input. Mr. LEAVITT Great explanation. This party. Mr. Shen, I will tell you, I'm not fully in love with this proposal, but I do understand the merits.I'm going to support it. And so with that, I believe you by spirit. We're going to make the motion to adopt this resolution.Thank you. I'm approval of the staff recommendation and the resolution as written.Thank you. In a second.I'll second.All right. It's been moved by Vice-President Slade, seconded by Councilmember Ody. Any further discussions? Seeing. And may we have a roll call vote, please.I'm sober, Doug.No.Not quite. All righty, Odie. I vela i mayor as the guy that carries 41.Thank you, Madam Crooks. We have one more item that was pulled also by Councilor Woodside and that's item five. Oh, Madam. Quick, could you introduce that item, please?I know. Positive audience approving a Third Amendment to development agreement by and among the city of Alameda Partners and Alta Vista owner governing the Del Monte Warehouse Project located at the northeast corner of the intersection of Sherman Street and Buena Vista Avenue to extend the completion date for the Common Extension improvements by one year and authorizing thecity manager or designee to grant an additional one year extension without further action by the City Council Planning Board.And I think the city manager would like to recuse himself. Yes, yes.Yes, you're.Correct. He lives near the property. Okay. So we will let you disappear. And Councilmember De said, do you want staff reported? You said.\nReasoning:",

Full disclosure I have not studied the entire budget, but from what I can see it is but ugly. It's the only way to describe our financial situation. So much so. I'm going to suggest that notwithstanding the tremendous effort and tremendous results that our good chief of police are doing is doing, is that this be the last? Council meeting held in the city hall. Given the number of shootings in close proximity and that we consider having. The City Council meetings, perhaps out in the fifth District. Well aware away from the gunfire.Period. And I see this situation continuing. And in addition to that, I would suggest this, that the council declare a state of emergency. And take the necessary steps to dissolve the office of full time mayor. And wait, you know, until next year when obviously we will be having a new mayor and a new city manager anyway.The financial situation in this city, I think warrants that type of action. But particularly relocating the city council meetings to a district where there's not gunfire within four or five blocks away and the number of killings that are at a record level.Thank you.Thank you. Now we're going to move on to the budget hearing item. So I'm going to turn this over actually to Vice Mayor Lowenthal, who is going to walk us through the items as a remembered reminder to the council.There's a these are a series. There's going to be a series of recommendations on a variety of items, and there has to be a vote on each one. Vice Mayor Lilienthal.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I wanted to acknowledge that we don't have member Your Honor here. And so for for the City General Fund related items, we will wait for Council Member, Your Honor, and take those up at the next council meeting.We've had a series of Budget Oversight Committee meetings with co-chair, Councilmember Mongeau and committee member Councilwoman Pryce. And we've had lots of discussion about items that council members have raised earlier and during the budget presentations when we've had departments make these presentations.And so we've also had community members come out and speak for issues that are important to them. Notably, Mr. Aaron Fletcher was there at every single budget oversight committee meeting, as well as each of our offices, reminding us of the importance of of what lifeguards do and what cuts to that department or that division mean to allof us in the city, not just along the coast, but our entire city. So with that, Mr. Mayor, what I'd like to do is ask our council colleagues to consider adopting a certain number of these items. They're more or less ministerial items.And if I may ask Mr. City attorney for his opinion on whether I do have the items correct. I am looking at items 1.1 through 1.9 as ones that we can take today. That would be non. General fund items, which I hope to hold for next week.That's correct.Okay. So I proceed. Mr. Mayor.So we thank you.Okay. So I'd like to recommend to receive the supporting documentation into the record and conclude the public hearing and take actions to adopt the following items. Item 1.1 Actually, Mr. City Attorney, do we need to do item 1/1?Yes, we need to do. Well, you can start at 1.1.Okay. Thank you.

The committee recommends the bill passes amended.Councilmember Burgess, Thank you. This is the second quarter budget supplemental ordinance. We do this each quarter as we go through the year. This makes adjustments to the city budget that we adopted for this year. Last fall, for example, there's a $10 million allocation to Seattle City Light to respond to customer requests for utility connections and pole attachmentsthat will be repaid to the city through fees that city light charges. We also in committee amended the ordinance to approve to video technology specialist for the police department. We had approved funding for these positions last fall but because the body worn video camera.Jack was not ready to be implemented at the time. We did not give authority for the positions. Now that that program is moving forward, this gives authority for the police department to hire these two video technology specialists. There's also a $75,000 ad from Councilmember O'Brien to assist the Magnuson Park Community Center.What's wrong, Councilmember Johnson?Excuse me. Councilmember Johnson. That's right. You weren't here, but it was Councilmember Johnson. Sorry. My apologies.Being Councilmember Wise.And assist with the Magnuson Park Community Center and some services there for primarily for young people and children there. And then there's funding for the city auditor who is awarding a contract to the Seattle King County Health Department to assist with baseline research and evaluation that needs to be done for the city's new sweetened beverage tax, whichtakes effect in January. This baseline work is necessary to establish a baseline for something to be compared to. As we move forward with the tax and this $480,000 for that work will be repaid out of the proceeds from the beverage tax.Any questions or comments? Councilmember Johnson.Just want to say a quick thank you to my colleagues for supporting that amendment coming out of committee. Folks in the park have continued to identify issues that they would like the city council to keep on our radar screen.This was a first opportunity for us to identify some short term wins, which included supporting services for expanded hours at the community center, as well as supportive services through funding through the Human Services Department. I also want to bring to the public's attention that there was funding in this proposed second quarter supplemental to have the Facilities andServices Department hire a consultant Round Charles Street Campus Development Plan, which would effectively start the discussions that many in the Chinatown International District asked us to do for several years now and consider disposition of public lands on the Charles Street campus for redevelopment for affordable housing and community ownership.So two really good adds as part of the discussion. Looking forward to voting yes.Very good. And for the comments. Caspar Herbold.Thank you. I just want to thank the City Budget Office for including some funding in the second quarter supplemental that I became aware of the need for during our discussions in the first quarter supplemental. During that time, I discovered that there was a 2000 Seattle Department of Transportation's study that identified 24 High Priority Street segments, a highpriority for landslide mitigation, and discovered that 17 years later, we're only seven on on the list. I raised this as an issue and it did not does not require any sort of amendment did not require an amendment within within committee because the city budget office added 1.37 million into the second quarter supplemental to address several of theseHigh Priority Street segments that are on this list of 24. The six different segments that this this funding will now go towards towards addressing. And we also have a commitment from the city budget office to get us back on track with completing the other high priority segments on this 2000 year study.Thank you.Excellent. No further comments.

No items have been called out. Did I miss anything? All right. Madam Secretary, if you please, for the first item on our screens and councilmember terms, will you please put resolution 281 on the floor?I move that council resolution 281 be adopted.It has been moved and seconded questions by members of council. So first up, we have these are two late files that I called out. The first one is our renewal of the the local disaster declaration. So questions will do questions and comments as we move through here, see how many people are in the queue.Councilmember Leach.Thank you, Mr. President. I first want to thank the mayor for his bold and decisive leadership during this time and making decisions very early in the process, which will hopefully help to save lives. I just wanted to as we talk about emergency declarations, we've been doing a lot of education with our constituents that these issues really areadministrative in terms of freeing up more potential funding in the future to reimburse the city for costs that it has incurred, etc.. I do see that we have our budget director here and I would not have brought her down for this question, but since she's here, it might be helpful, if I may ask her a question.Jordan Thank you. I'd like to know if you can just explain to us whether any state or federal funding is available and flowing to the city at this time, or whether that is mostly a post hoc situation. And then the second question is whether or how you might be able to stay in communication with us about thingslike state or federal funding. You know, my guess is we will not need to act unless they hit that $500,000 threshold. But for us to understand what assistance the city is receiving and knowing you have many jobs right now and that you're probably juggling other things as well.But but just kind of trying to get a sense of how we can stay in touch with the financial impacts to the city, at least on the spending side. Thank you, sir. Stephanie Adams, budget managing director for the city and county of Denver.So, Councilman, at this time, there are no federal dollars that are flowing to the city and county of Denver. We are prepared and been monitoring very vigilantly to make sure that we're tracking our existing spending. I think probably, as you know, and many people are surprised, we don't set aside dollars specifically for emergencies.We don't know when they would come up. That's why they're emergencies. So we're currently having agencies use their existing appropriation to do that. So that is currently our status. We are in touch with the Federal Government as well as the state to understand what might be available and trying to stay ahead of making sure we're tracking ourexpenditures appropriately for any kind of reimbursements or any opportunities. But we have not applied for any of those at this time, but we're monitoring them. And your second question, I believe, is how to stay abreast of what is going on?Well, you know, it is an evolving thing. I will tell you that we had a set of messaging that we were talking to our agencies about on Wednesday, and by Friday it was kind of irrelevant. So we're doing our best to stay on top of it.As you know, the mayor is having weekly press conferences. I don't believe anything has been set up specifically for city council, although I'm looking at Kevin to see if there's any conversation that's being had. We're still trying to figure out how to stay in close communication with our agencies and moving as quickly as possible and in tryingto be as responsive and communicative as possible. And. Is there anything if I can just follow up, I just want to say thank you very much. I think that, you know, information about health services, finance is all very different.I wouldn't expect you to be responsible for anything. I guess I would ask if you do have the opportunity where we do secure state or federal funding, if you can please notify the council of that, even if it's at an amount that doesn't require us to take action just so we can see.And as our constituents ask us questions, are we getting help? When do we get help? It may not be for a long time, but just if it happens, can you just let us know? That would be great. Certainly.As soon as we understand what we'll be applying for, we'll do that. To your point, though, I just want to point out to everyone that oftentimes, in our experience has been in the past with disasters, it could take 2 to 3 years actually to get reimbursement from FEMA.Specifically, of course, this is a very unique circumstance, and we know that there are other kinds of funding available. So we believe that our best course of action is to make sure that we're being vigilant about tracking our expenditures, understanding how to use and preserve our reserves, looking at our budget and taking advantage of those opportunities asthey come as they become available. But but we recognize that those are in the future. Thank you. Certainly.Thank you. Councilmember Councilmember Hines.Don't go anywhere. Come on back. So since you're here, thank you. Thank you very much for coming. And I wasn't also necessarily I wouldn't have called you down, but since you're here, I thought we had set aside or we're targeting a 15% reserve.Where are we in relation to that 15% reserve? All right. Do we have the 15%?We do. Councilman, we're actually closing the books and we're waiting for our final audits to come through. We believe will will end a little above those reserves, given some of our unspent from the previous year. You may recall at the end of last year, we work with agencies and ask them to pull back on spending and theyreally stepped up. And so we are going to finish a little above that 15%. I can't give you a number yet. Want to make sure our numbers are audited, Alisyn, to remind you of our contingency that's available to in in our financial policies.That's the first place we'll go. I expect to be sitting in front of you here shortly to talk a little bit about how to leverage that contingency as we get a better handle on what we need to spend over the next several months.And then also, several people have reached out for small business assistance and rental and mortgage assistance. I mean, I know that a lot of our revenue that we collect is from lodgers fees and sales tax. I think that's about half the but half the revenue.Right. So as as people as as we get emergencies that the national, state and local level that tell people not to congregate and not to travel and not to go to hotels, that affects us as well. So I'm not trying to put you on the spot, but since you're here, what I'm guessing that our budget is ina bigger crunch and so it's hard for us to then open up more money for for small businesses, for hotels and for rental and mortgage assistance. Do you have any thoughts on that?Councilman, we're evaluating all of our options. We recognize that while we have an obligation to assure that we have the funding to continue the commitments that we've currently made and maybe some changes to our work plan, we also recognize that our community is hurting in trying to understand what sort of balance we have.To your point, not only is it about understanding the level of expenditures and the needs out there, but we're trying to understand what the impact might be on our revenue. Again, on Wednesday, we were trying to understand what the potential impact might be of just the conferences that we're no longer coming.Here are the visitors who are no longer coming here. And now we recognize that with our restaurants and bars being closed, that will be a pretty significant impact on our revenues. So I will I am 100% sure that we will be revising down the 2020 revenue assumptions, but we're still trying to understand with the severity and thelength of this impact might be. So I don't have a good answer for you. Now, I am sure that we will have to to revise down our revenue and we'll be coming to you as soon as we have a better handle on that.Okay. Thank you. And I can only imagine the position that you're in. I mean, the you know, the state just presented their budget analysis this afternoon. I didn't I didn't pay attention because we were focusing on local things.But I can only imagine just the whirlwind that you were going through. And so I didn't expect you to have answers right now. But but people are asking questions. So so if you could consider that. Absolutely. Thank you.And then. So one other question that I have that isn't related to budget is we want to extend until May 11th, not for seven days, but for the entire declaration for the mayors.That right. So thank you for that question, Councilmember. You know, a lot of you know, as you have heard, there is new information coming in every second. And and there are a lot of opportunities hopefully potentially for funding open with this.So this was arrived at based on the latest from the CDC at the time this was drafted, which was suggesting that large events and gatherings of over 50 people, there's now possibly new recommendations coming out be canceled for the next eight weeks.So we know that our citizens, our businesses are going to be dealing with some sort of restriction from the CDC that is going to be affecting them at least through then. And instead of putting it at a future date on a council meeting, again, if we arrive at a place where we'll talk about next, where there isa council meeting, where there is not immediate action that we need to take, that we may choose to cancel to avoid congregating. This gives us the flexibility of not having to constantly be up against that possible loss of of this when we know we're going to be feeling the effects of it, at least for the next eightweeks.And it is possible for us to reconvene and rescind the balance of that of that order, as I. Correct?Yeah, that is correct. So this now falls within our purview to to rescind or to further extend if there are new guidelines coming from the CDC.Great. Thank you. Our budget office.

Next item, please.Report from police. Recommendation to execute an agreement with the Long Beach Public Transportation Company to provide law enforcement and security services and an estimated annual amount not to exceed 2,429,477 citywide.Thank you. I have a couple questions and comments. Councilman Price, did you have anything? First. Okay, Councilman Austin. Okay. Just also just I first officer, I know just a chief in the team. I know the transition to taking over all of the Metro stops on that transit side.You guys have just done amazing. And I just think it's it's needed I needed to repeat that this the response we're getting from riders and from the community. You guys are doing a great job. I know it's it's a new job.It's the first time we've done this work, but it's excellent. I wanted to just transition that to the Long Beach Transit conversation. I know obviously that LAPD, for example, does some transit work. The sheriffs obviously do do a lot of the metro bus stops as well as transit on the Long Beach transit contract.But the the patrol is for both kind of bus stops as well as inside the busses, is that right?Mayor, members of the city council?That's correct. The current contract covers Long Beach transit busses and the stops throughout their contract, which is beyond the city of Long Beach as well.And there is there are all transit stops within the city of Long Beach patrolled solely by Long Beach PD. I think that's correct. Right?Yes. Although Long Beach Transit bus stops are.That's correct. And this contract does just cover the non Lombard Transit bus stops. I'm just assuming it's all bus stops, whether they're Long Beach Transit and or operated by the city of Long Beach because Long Beach the city of Long Beach operates about half the stops and then lobby transit does the other half.Is it is this inclusive of just theirs or does this also include the cities or is that just fall under normal kind of city process?Sorry about that. That would fall under the normal city process.So in in essence, Long Beach PD covers all the bus stops in the city of Long Beach.Okay. So we cover we, but the 2.5 million that we're getting from transit is only to cover their bus stops. I'm assuming not the bus stops you guys regularly patrol as part of. I mean, I get it. No, it's not.You have a map. You know, you guys, you're saying, oh, this is a Long Beach Transit one. This is a Long Beach one. But it essentially allows you to fill in the gap and cover all the bus stops.Correct.I'd have to double check that mayor. I don't know exactly. I'm trying to think right now how many bus stops we have in the city of Long Beach that are not Long Beach Transit. I know there's some out there by Cal.State, Long Beach. There's about 200 to be 195.Yeah, I'd have to double check that. But if something happens at any bus stop in the city, Long Beach PD is going to be the first responders to there. And then beyond that, we can figure out who or what jurisdiction covers it.Okay. Thank you. And I just bring this up because I've become a little bit obsessed with our our bus stops lately, as you know, as Tom is laughing because I, I am pretty, pretty consistent about this. I just want to make sure that we have our our guys are doing such a great job.But I just want to make sure that we have the resources to adequately patrol the city's bus stops. Bus stops have become transient campgrounds. In some cases, they have become. I've seen seniors being forced off bus stops. I have seen folks not in a safe environment, able to take the bus.And we don't have the resources to ensure, obviously, that all that all these bus stops are are taken care of appropriately. But I don't know that the when was the last time that we increased this number? It was it was recent or not.But I would just hope I. I'm concerned that this is not enough. From our transit agency to provide adequate resources to patrol all the bus stops. And all the work that you guys are doing is, in my opinion, a bus stop.Safety has become a much larger issue in the last couple of years. And so I wonder if you have any thoughts on that. It's something we're.Going to have to take a very hard look at. I agree with your earlier statements. The men and women of our department are doing an extraordinary job with the workload.And.Expectations that are driving us. But as we look forward to serving our our customers here at Long Beach Transit, we'll continue to look at this as a challenge. And if it is something that is exceeding our resources, we will not be shy about going back to the table and asking for additional resources to cover this, if itis, in fact, a challenge for us. And it sounds like, from what you're describing, it may be.I appreciate that. And I support this tonight. I just wanted to make sure that, you know, that I support us, ensuring that we have enough resources to do this job appropriately as well. So thank you for that. Any public comment on this?Very good you. With all due respect to the good chief, the very concept of that you entered into. It was an absolute disaster, period. And I speak as one who has more experience on the blue line than any single person here in this room.Period. Transit policing is a specialized detail. Period. No ifs. No answer. No buts. Period. The crime rate here and the incidents on the tracks, on the trains. Have. There's been a steady increase. They may not be reported to the police because the police don't get there in time to stop the problem, period.This is you're you're an absolute denial. And in time, I think the MTA board will be enlightened enough to reverse the disastrous steps you took period to try to enhance your political career by extending that. It's an absolute disaster.Thank you. And you know the public comment. Catherine Ashton, did you have comment?Yes. Chief, and I want to thank you for that. I think this this discussion is worthwhile. I just have a couple of quick questions regarding the staffing dedicated to Long Beach Transit. Is there a specific number of officers or detail that is specific to this?Or is it just kind of. Well, we do in the normal course of business. Yes, sir.We have eight total sworn officers that are attached to this contract. That is their sole task that they do.Great. Great.

And wanted to express my appreciation to city staff, particularly the park head, Ms.. Amy Woolridge, as well as outgoing city manager John Russo and this council and previous councils in bringing us to this point, look forward to whatever designs that Bcf comes up with a project like this. You know, we do need on important city projects like this, we do need expertize like from outfits such as Bcf design and we'll have to do so on many other things.I think the key thing though is that we're clear as to the scope of work that's involved our expectations and it's all outlined in the detailed information packet that that Ms. Woolridge had had provided. So I'm excited about this and I know that on this and any other projects, we'll always scope out carefully the costs and thetype of work that we expect because we we anticipate and we hope to have a variety of things, not just things like the Jean Sweeney Park, but perhaps even a workable traffic transit solution.

Torres, I.Council President.Hi, Madam Secretary. Please close the voting. Announce the results.12 hours.12 hours. Resolution 185 has been adopted. Madam Secretary, if you could please put the next item on our screens. And, Councilmember Hines, will you please put Resolution 186 on the floor?Mr. President, I move that council is at 186. I move the council resolution 20, dash 186 be adopted.Thank you. It has been moved and seconded. Comments by members of Council. Council Member CdeBaca.Thank you, Mr. President. And just for background on this change. This rule in particular caused a lot of disagreement around keeping or getting rid of the word impugn, because I personally believe that we have a job to question the decision making of our colleagues.And so in order to mitigate the the contention, I think it's important for us to operate from common definitions. Therefore, what this is doing is adding a common definition of what impugn is to mean, so that we're codifying that definition and have something to look back on and stand on when we believe that somebody has inappropriately impugnsomeone.Thank you, Councilmember Councilmember Flynn.I thank Mr. President. This is one of those items that had been amended out of the proposed resolution for further discussion at committee by agreement of everyone there. So I was again surprised to see that it was moved to the floor with some changes.But I think those changes, Councilwoman, should be discussed, particularly the councilwoman, which had some issues with it as well, and she had to leave the meeting here tonight. And so I would make a motion to refer this to committee so that we can discuss.I believe that your changes here are going in the right direction. After you and I had a conversation about one of the common meanings of impugn that would seem to prevent us from questioning a person's set of facts or data.And certainly we don't want to inhibit that. But I think we do want to maybe be a little more thoughtful and intentional about this new definition that you've put in when you filed this on Thursday. And we have not had a chance to discuss this should go back to committee so that we can discuss it and makeit right. Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember. All right, so we have a motion on the floor to refer which has been seconded. So we'll do questions and comments on the motion to re refer. Council member said welcome.Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to respond to Councilman Flynn's request to re refer. I actually incorporated the discussion that we had in committee to define impugn. And so that is why it says for the purposes of this section, impugn means to verbally assault, threaten or harass another through a knowingly false statement made with malice tounjustly that unjustly harms their reputation. That took into consideration the definitions discussed the first time we voted on the rules, as well as the concerns and definitions that were thrown out during committee. This is to say that this is what this means, because this is not the definition.I believe this this is not the definition of impugn that I understand or agree with. And so in order for me to feel like this is a rule that I can follow, defining it is very important to me.And I feel like if we could get this on the books tonight, I would be happy with someone coming forward in committee and bringing a change to it. Because I asked during committee where we're supposed to do the work if anyone would propose a definition themselves.And I got no proposal of a definition, and so I'm forced to define it in the way that I've heard others define it and put something forward and allow somebody else to respond to it the way that I've had to respond to these rules as a whole.Thank you, Councilmember.Councilmember Flynn thing, Mr. President, comes from what you've what you've laid out. There is a fantastic case for having this discussion in committee, because I think people did want to react and doing it here on the floor on Monday night, particularly with one of the members who had a particular problem with this.Not being present is is not the best place to do that. For instance, in the definition that you've proposed, you you wanted to limit impugn to making a knowingly false statement. And I have been the object of statements that were unknowingly false.And so I do want to refine it further and have a better discussion on it. But I agree with some of your concerns about the broad definition of impugn and how it would seem to prevent us from questioning another member's statements of fact.I'm fully on board with that. I think we can get there, but I think it should be in committee and we can we can work that out.Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Councilmember Hines.Thank you, Mr. President. The only additional comment that I would say is that we're we're a council of 13. And and I recognize that at that committee hearing, we didn't we didn't offer a definition. I know I was concerned because I had a meeting immediately after that committee meeting.And so but I, I am interested in hearing the discussion as opposed to I think that you're making a good a new definition for that, for impugn. But I would like to have this consultation with my colleagues. And because it's a consultation about policy, it should be in a public forum like a committee.Thank you, Councilmember. All right. See nobody else. I'll just add number one again. I really want to thank you, Councilmember CdeBaca, for being willing to come from where you started to take that feedback that was provided in committee and come back with it.You know, I was one of the people was very open to definitions and the definitions section. I really appreciate that. I think just the piece that was missing for me was that opportunity to provide feedback on the definition before we're here doing it.And so I think, you know, it's something as simple as sending out an email, not for a group discussion, but give me feedback back on, Hey, this is the definition I'm thinking, do you like it? And then you could come report to us, Hey, I sent out an email or got feedback from the 13 of you andnow here I am with the definition that everyone got I was on board for. As part of that, I think that can happen in committee. I think that you could solicit feedback, you know, on this proposal, lots of proposals that lead up to that, but allow that to happen before we're here on Monday night.And so I think, again, I like where we're headed. I don't know that we're there quite yet and I'm eager to hear that. So I think committee is a great place to do it. And so I'm supportive of the motion to refer now to Secretary Roll Call on the referral.FLYNN Hi.BLACK Hi.CDEBACA No.GILMORE All right.Herndon I.Can't.I.Cashman I.Can eat. Sorry. Ortega Sandoval.

So no secret to anybody, unless you've been living under a rock or in a cave, that a year or so ago, the airport, with the approval of this council and the administration, entered into a very complex, important project renovating the great hall that went sideways, creating problems for the city, team travelers, etc. It'sin everybody's best interests that we move forward as quickly as.Possible.In completing the project as close to envisioned as possible, as quickly as possible. But the question that I get most often from constituents is what about the New Deal.That's being crafted?Gives promise that this will be managed more efficiently and more successfully than the original contract called for. So I wanted to ask anybody on the airport team to give us that.Give us their best view of that.Good evening, members of Council. My name is Krystal Torres de Herrera. I am the executive vice president, chief of staff for Denver International Airport. And thank you, Councilman Cashman, for asking that important question. We often get that question as well, and I appreciate the opportunity to answer that fully.So first, I would just like to say, you know, everyone's asking how is tomorrow going to be different than today? And I would tell you right here, right now, today is already different. In the past 90 days, we've accomplished more on this project than what has happened in the last year.To stand before you today with five contracts that we have done through a competitive selection process in just a short period of time, less than 90 days is a true testament to how quickly and how decisively we are moving.But to also get to your question, we have also brought on additional resources such as Jacobs to assist on the program management side, to assist with us in keeping the projects moving and holding ourselves accountable, because at the end of the day, the buck stops with us.We acknowledge that and we own that. And we have looked very hard at ensuring that that happens as we move forward. We've also committed, as we talked with you in basic committee, about fuller transparency and what that means for the public and having a public facing dashboard where people can go on fly Denver dot com and seethe status of the project. We think that level of accountability and openness with the public and transparency will assist with all of this as well. We're also incredibly customer focused. That was something that we want to make sure we continue to carry through.We do know to your point that it is burdensome on the passengers and the public who travel through our airport. We want to make sure that they can get to their flights, go to see their families for the holidays in the best possible way possible.Earlier this week, we started installing directional decals on the floor to show people how to get to ticketing, how to get to security. We're constantly looking for ways to make it easier for the public. So those are some of the things that we are doing currently to ensure that tomorrow is different from what has happened prior tothis. And we take it very seriously. I've also got Michael Sheehan up here who can answer any other specific questions on the contract side.Thank you. Thank you for that. That answers my question. Thank you.Thank you very much.Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Flint.Thank you, Mr. President. First, I think the the public should be aware that the principal reason for undertaking this in the first place is in the post-9-11 world to reconfigure the terminal that was never designed for the kind of environment that we're in today that we need to provide a much more safe, effective and efficient and secureway to process passengers through security. A lot of us remember when the airport opened and the the fifth level of the gypsum terminal was a public gathering place, a very pleasant place. And that all changed after September 11th.And we have to adjust to that. And that's the principal reason this is being done. And to Echo Councilman Cashman is the principal reason that we need to get it under way as quickly as possible. Having said that, I share with a lot of the public the same sort of anxiety about whether this.Will be.The path forward that gets it done on budget and in less time. I have a lot of confidence in the companies that have been selected. And I would point out all those this will undermine what I just said.I'll point out that this is a similar project management structure as that which was used to build the airport in the first place. So as long as we don't try to add an automated baggage system, we should be fine, perhaps.But I think that going forward with this structure, it and still not knowing exactly what it's going to look like at the end of the day. I look forward to very soon when the next contract comes forward in early next year.Is that correct?That's correct. So we anticipate having the next contract and hopefully as soon as January and.That will be the the actual.Contract to correct.Exactly that, then we will be able to tell our constituents, here's what this will look like. But in the meantime, I believe it's essential, Mr. President, that we move forward with these contracts now so that we can fashion those details and get them before us sometime in January.Thank you.Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Hines.Thank you, Mr. President. Hi.How are you? I'm good. How are you?I'm all right.I saw his dog earlier. I saw his dog right here.Yeah. So a question for you. We talked I mentioned this in in Biz Committee, I. You as as an airport and as a as a management team have set the bar high for accountability and transparency. And you had a statement that you made about accountability and transparency that.Frankly.Made me not ask a whole bunch more questions. So do you recall that statement?And if you recall that statement, would you like me to repeat that? Yes, please. Okay. Absolutely. At this committee and it was a very great conversation, very thorough conversation by the members on that. I made the comment that we are committed to a level of transparency that the city has never seen before on a project of thismagnitude. And we take that incredibly seriously, and that is exactly what we're looking for.So thank you for that statement. Thank you for setting the bar high. I think that I want to empower you to do all you can and certainly on one tember to succeed. I want Dan to succeed and we'll be holding you to that.I hope you do, because we'll be holding ourselves to that as well.Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Ortega.Thank you, Mr. President. Hi, Crystal.Hi, Councilwoman Ortega.I think we are all very anxious to get the project improvements done. It's going to certainly improve the experience for the traveling public and the employees. The question I want to ask is when? What is the timing? When do you all anticipate resolution of how much has to be paid out to the Great Hall Partners?Because that is key to the scope of work moving forward, because that then determines how much we have to scale the project back and we don't know what that figure is yet. So do you have a ballpark idea?So I so appreciate you asking this because we are working on that as quickly as possible. To your point, it's a very important piece of information that as we move forward, we want to know. So we are really trying to resolve that as quickly as possible.We would love to have it wrapped up by the end of the year. But to be safe, we've told people that we were trying to get it done by Q1, but certainly as soon as possible.To we anticipate that that will be resolved before we do the contract with the general contractor that you will be bringing forward to us next year.We would hope to have that be the case, but we're not the only people in that environment to make that happen. And so there's a lot of, you know, it's complicated and so we're trying our best to get that done.Okay.The last thing I want to say is. I'm pleased that we have all these local contractors and local minority contractors that are now part of the project moving forward. Some of us wish this is how we would have done it from the very beginning.But, you know, it's it we are where we are. And I think you all are trying to be as diligent and efficient in trying to move the project forward. I know you couldn't do anything once the decision was made until the building was actually handed back to us.Which was last week, right? Correct. So now that we've got control of the space, it allows us to step in and do the that work that needs to happen. So I know these contracts tonight are key to moving the project forward, so thank you for having done the tour for many of us week before last to helpus really see some of the challenges that were that were posed to the airport during that whole phase of trying to work with an outside company. So thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Flynn, your backup.Thing, Mr. President, just stated. I should have added that as a member of this council who supported going forward with a three with the P3 back in 2017 and now being in a position of regretting that given the circumstances of what happened, I think it's very essential that before this Council is asked to support another P3 project, even outside of the airport, that the airport produce a robust, not just a lessons learned, but about an autopsy, if you will, on what went wrong. And and I would hope that it would examine our faults as well and what we did and how we how we're improving that in this next round.And we'd really at least I think most members up here, probably all of us, need to have a very clear understanding of what happened. Before we will undertake this kind of venture again. I think that's important for many other projects in the city that that be produced.And I would ask that that be undertaken. And again, not just the lessons learned, not just a you know, not a not just a 12 page report, but give us you know, let's let's air our laundry and let's find out what did we do wrong and how have we fix that?Thank you.I appreciate that. If I can just respond to that for a second. And we had this conversation in Biz Committee, and we are certainly committed to making sure that the lessons that we learned are shared throughout the city family.We think that's incredibly important as we all move forward, not just for us, but for the entire city.All right. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. That concludes the questions or comments on this item.

It's really kind of funny, you know, that we have a couple of years left.If you've read the latest APEC report on climate impacts, only a couple of years left to do anything to have a livable future for any of us. And uh, we have a couple of proposals here for half of the grant money that we're supposed to have a presentation about November 18 regarding our youth climate program, state fundingfor which but this is private money from the Hilton Foundation, which apparently has deep reserves after the pandemic to direct Pacific Gateway. If any of you can read or have your staff even read the staff report for either the 17 or 23, I mean, it's fucking ridiculous, you know, like, oh, we're going to take disadvantaged youth, youknow, a couple hundred of them and stick them in space. The moment where you use all the last resources, we have to send a couple of balding white assholes to space. I mean, seriously, like, what is this all for?But more generally, I mean, when it comes to the fact that I mean, this is a city government and you are charged technically with the safety and security and well-being of all of your residents. Uh, it's kind of surprising that we would direct our social and public resources in this way.Um, the data collection protocols will be developed by the evaluator and the Institutional Review Board to allow for the use of data in future publications. Uh, yeah. I mean, you know who's going to read them? Thank you.That concludes public comment.Restaurants in the UK up again that.So just wanted to highlight this program. I think this is incredible. So based on the staff report and based on what I understand from the program, it's you know, the Office of Youth Development is going to start a really great program for 300 youth from, you know, different communities, disadvantaged communities across Long Beach.And half of those youth will be connected directly with the Pacific Gateway Space Beach program. So they're going to get access to the emerging aerospace jobs that are in our city. I think that's incredible. I think also just to acknowledge that this is the first year that we actually have an Office of Youth Development, the youth ofthese office youth development's brand new. And we already see really good things. One and a half million dollar grant. So special thanks to the Conrad Hilton Foundation for for helping, you know, provide some much needed resources to this brand new office youth development that's going to make a real difference.All of this is sort of in alignment with the initial work around youth development with the boys, Women of Color, My Brother's Keeper work, which was the roots of this years ago.

I know I've had a chance to review it already, but if I can just make it brief, please.Gerardo and.Meredith.Yes. We're excited about this opportunity to pass it on to the Meredith friends.Good evening, Mayor. Members. City Council. This item is to receive and file the Drake Chavez vision plan along with authorization to submit a grant for Prop 68 State Park Bond. If you recall, in 2010, the Drake Chavez masterplan was completed.That was followed by a series of community stakeholder discussions, which was really focused on amassing properties for park purposes that would connect Cesar Chavez Park to Drake Park through the development of wetlands and passive and active open space.There was a big effort by the city over the coming years to purchase just over 15 acres of property in the Drake Chavez neighborhood through grants and local funding. This master plan has been in existence for quite some time, but since that those purchases have been made, many new projects have begun to impact the future park parcels, including projects like the Long Beach Must the 710 realignment proposed by the California Department of Transportation and the Schumaker Bridge Replacement Project and the Drake Chavez Vision Plan worked to incorporate all of these new projects in addition to new feedback from the community and this vision plan updates that original plan.This is a guide, kind of a visionary document that guides future improvement at these acquired and undeveloped park parcels, as well as the future improvements to Drake Park and Cesar Chavez Parks to address the needs of the community.So our effort included all of those different things, which is included in your packet as the ultimate vision plan. But there's a one particular parcel we focused on very specifically for the 8.5 million grant dollars, which is the parcel at 970 West Chester, which currently is the home to the MTA bus lot, that was one of theparcels that was previously bought in anticipation of connection of those parcels to those parks. Through this community process, it was inclusive and multilingual. Our Parks Department partnered with the first Council district, the Wilmore Heritage Neighborhood Association, Communities with Power to Change the nonprofit.Katie, who Paola is here as a representative, and we'll speak with you here momentarily, as well as public health advocates, where we conducted this community engagement for the Vision Plan over a series of nine public workshops, the community developed multiple project priorities, three community sourced vision concepts, and ultimately voted on their priorities for the final vision plan. Four That parcel of the MTA lot. The first opportunity for funding for this comes through Prop 68, the State Park Fund, which the grant is due here shortly. And that is what we've been working toward for the vision plan and for this particular property for the first phase of that development.This particular grant is really focused on open, active, outdoor space. So in the plan for this property, in your packet you will see an open grass area, playgrounds, walking, jogging trail, picnic areas, shade structures, outdoor fitness equipment and a variety of sports amenities.Park completion of this grant application. Should we be successful? Those would be the first steps to move forward with our community through a follow up community process. With that, that concludes staff's report. And we're here available for any questions.Thank you. Let me just make some comments. I've been working on the Drake Park Master Plan since I was on the city council or before that, a community community activist. And this is I know this plant obviously very well and I'm very, very excited about us moving forward.A couple of things. I'll just I just want to add, you know, one, I think when we first started this many years ago, it was really important for us to get the active pieces done. And we obviously working with Councilman Gonzales, just getting the soccer field, the the initial soccer field done, the walking the walking paths.We work with Wilmore also to do some landscaping work throughout the area and make some connections, particularly with some of the D.G. we put out there. And there's been so much improvement from where it is today, from where it was ten years ago when a lot of the work initially started, but really glad that we're moving forwardon this grant. And in addition to the grant, I know that the port at the port already worked with with our office in being very supportive of our efforts at the Colorado Lagoon. We worked with Councilwoman Price and staff to ensure a substantial investment in the Colorado Lagoon, and that is something we've been working on for afew years and I've already had some preliminary discussions and with the port as well. And so the next what I expect will be important investment from the port will be my request to the to the Drake Chavez vision masterplan for the connection of Cesar Chavez to the rest of of Drake Park.And so I look forward to championing and getting this project done for the community. It connects with our vision for the L.A. River, and it connects with plans and communities and working on for a very long time, at least at least close to a decade since I remember our parks team being there every step of the way. And so with that comes of Pierce.Yes, I. The second park I spend the most time at is actually Drake Park. So while it's not in my district, it's one that's near and dear to my heart. My daughter first went down a slide for the very first time.So congratulations again to a community that's done this work. Congratulations, everybody. It's been building on this for so long. I look forward to the next steps.Thank you accounts from Councilmember Richardson. As for public comment, please come forward.Hello. My name is and I can feel District six. I think this is a, you know, a great, greatly needed an improvement in the neighborhood. I grew up going to the part jam that happens at Drake Park. I know that for.Statewide when Mr. De Leon, when he brought this in to the Senate, you know, Greenspaces are very much a needed necessity in areas that don't have it, such as this part of the First District. But it's also important to note that we don't just build these green mausoleums.That's what I like to call the parks in Long Beach. A lot of them are just green mausoleums, meaning that they're just edifices that are celebrating space. But we don't necessarily provide budgeting or funding towards programing, cultural events, and in particular parkson's in in the city.So maybe if Parks and Recreation, in addition to taking over that lot, that empty lot, which is which is nice, it's bad to look at. We can also provide some funding for programing in this area that isn't just like the municipal used using that space or I know I appreciate the the center there that's named after Mr.Peyser. But, you know, it would be great if we, you know, have programing such as like, you know, there's a lot of graffiti artists in that area. You know, we can utilize them. You know, it could team up with L.A. Metro instead of having people on the trains.Maybe they can around the parking lots there, they could be able to do some of the work that they do in the same places like at MacArthur Park. You know, there's a lot of graffiti artists that use Homeland and teach art and painting to the children and neighborhood.You know, it's great to have children use these spaces, you know, beyond just having these spaces and beyond just having wetlands. It's great to have children outside in the spaces all year long, not just when it's the summer.So great that we're expanding the park and I'm glad the wetlands are being developed. But also I'd like to see more emphasis by Parks and Rec towards providing funding in these parks so that we can have children and adults and everyone outside, you know, whether it's movies in the, you know, movies in the park, a variety ofways to utilize it. Thank you so much.Thank you so much. Next week, please.Hi, my name is Mariella Salgado and I'm from the First District. I also serve as a Parks and Rec commissioner and I wanted to say something.That I remember at one of the meetings. I think Meredith might find it humorous, too. Kathleen Irvine, who is the president of the Walmart Neighborhood Association, said, I just want this project to be done before I die. And it really kind of brought to light to me how long people have been working on it.So I appreciate Mayor Robert Garcia mentioning in that because it's been a long collective effort. Um, I wanted to speak.A little bit about.In addition to kind of piggy bank a what this gentleman said is.We know the importance of early education, parks, programing, arts and music and it's proven effect reduce negative health impacts, crime and ability to stimulate growth. Children most in need of arts and music instruction have been the least likely to have access to it.Less fortunate children have been receiving what I'd call the emergency room approach to education, one that addresses.Sorry I lost my place. One that addresses on the parts of a child thought to be the.Most dire need of attention and subject to state exams.Math, reading and writing.I've seen it as a school, say council member at Edison Elementary, the fourth lowest performing.School.In the school district. I've seen it in early education as part of the Long Beach Early Childhood Education Committee. Those in low income communities have less access to high quality childcare in great public spaces, including green space. And I've seen it as a Parks and Rec commissioner where we have the least green.Greenspace per 1000 residents.So I really look forward to this project and like I strongly believe.That equity is the way forward.And I really hope that.This project.And we get.Awarded and moves forward and continues to.Add greenspace for our.Kids and yes, programing. Thanks so much.Thank you. Thanks, Speaker, please. Good evening, Mr. Mayor and council members. My name is Patrick Goddard and I'm a resident of the fifth District. I support the vision plan for the Drake Chavez redevelopment and the authorization to seek grant funding.As a skateboarder and parent of a skateboarder, my interest is in the potential for a new skate park within this project. Drake currently has a skate spot that is old and outdated, so a new skate park as one of the new amenities is very welcome.Skate parks are some of the most well-used features and parks in Long Beach, while we have nine skate parks currently. Long Beach is a large city with a large amount of users of our skate spots. The more terrain, so to speak, the Better Hawaiian Gardens and Harbor City are examples of nearby cities with newer skate parks arevery successful. Harbor City's new skate park, in particular, has generated a lot of buzz and has been an instant hit with the skateboard community. I would love to see a well-designed, well built skate park built as part of this project.Goes without saying. But the area surrounding Drake and Chavez is well deserving of all new park amenities, not just a skate park. And I look with great excitement to see what unfolds with this development. Thank you.Thank you. Next week.Hi. Good evening. My name is Paula mendez. I'm here with Concrete Design Initiative, which Meredith mentioned was one of the partners on this project, were new to this long standing community effort that has been going on. But we're very excited about what we've been able to create together in partnership with the Parks Department and with the membersof the community and the community groups. I'm here to express support for the park and the broader Tree Harvest Vision plan. And I wanted to reiterate from what Meredith said, the strong role that community members played in this process.We were able to bring together groups in the community that have traditionally been very active and very vocal, along with groups whose voices have not always been heard. And this has allowed us to create a plan together.That will benefit.This diverse community, particularly the youth and families. I also wanted to highlight a couple of additional comments that we heard from community members throughout this process that are outside of the scope of the grant at hand, but that I wanted to make sure we captured moving forward as this longstanding process continues.First, to echo a previous comment that we heard tonight during public comment, programing would really greatly benefit this area and was strongly desired by community members, particularly to keep youth and teens out of trouble. And I would urge members of this council to encourage and support programing, as well as the participatory processes and community based planning processesthat have led to the identification of these needs and these ideas. And secondly, particularly as the first Council District is filled, I would also encourage the Council to consider additional measures that could be implemented in this area moving forward to prevent any displacement or potential displacement of residents that could occur as an indirect result of developing thisnew park. During the process, I heard concerns from many community residents around increasing rents in the area, causing people to have to move further away from the neighborhood, severing local ties between residents and, you know, sometimes causing people to move out of the city.We heard concerns from the very residents are involved in creating this park that they don't know if they will be able to stay around long enough to benefit from this park that they themselves are shaping for their children.Some residents suggested creating a Latino cultural arts district, which could be guided by a local Latino Cultural Arts Council. And I would urge the city council here to consider this or other appropriate solutions to prevent any displacement before it starts.Thank you.You so much. There's emotion in a second. Please cast your votes through roll call, please. District one. I'm sorry. District to District three.II.District.Four, High.District five. Hi. District six.

Did you want to begin by kind of giving a brief on those items or.Councilman Gonzales.Okay.So on four and five, the destruction of records. I just wanted to first off, they're potentially a very important and substantial primary sources of language history. So with that, I wanted to direct City Clerk to work with the Historical Society of Long Beach on the management of these records and perhaps digitizing them.And then also report back in about 30 days and then just going forward to continue working with community groups in this respect.Okay.I was second that.Seconded by Councilmember Austin to the motion in a second on the on the item. Mr. Herrera, did you have any comments on that?I wanted to thank the council members for pulling this item, as well as the public for paying attention to our agenda. Putting this on the agenda serves its purpose where the public is notified consistent with the Long Beach Municipal Code of records about to be destroyed.And we will hold those in abeyance until we come back to the council.Thank you. So there's a motion on the floor to take any public comment on the item.Mayor. This is items four and five.Items four and five. Yes.Larry, good. You click as we address specifically zeroing in on four and the destruction of the records from the Cal and and O'Neill administration of certainly the integrity of those two terms has never been in question. Like our esteemed governor, they got a standing invitation to stand side by side with Caesar's wife.The last eight years, however, is an entirely different matter, which prompted me to ask right at this point to the city attorney, what assurances do we have? That Rosemary Woods will never have access to these tapes or any future tapes or records.Mr.. Where can we ever speak to the the agenda?Continue your.Career? I think it's very important to understand the integrity and the level of integrity we have with records, period, and I think the concept of destroying the records of the past eight years. When on the heels of learning that there will be a federal and state investigation relative to a number of people in that.Within that past eight years raises. So serious questions and strains, even the weakest of olfactory senses. And I would suggest moving forward, if there's no objection from Mayor Cal or Beverly O'Neil of destroying their records. But hold, pending the outcome of a federal and state investigation of the complicity relative to the matter, which was earlier referred to, i.e. in that ten page package, dealing with the complicity to gift illegally $300,000 to a select few. Delete the first two there. O'Neals and Madam Park and Ernie Kels. If they don't have an objection. But do not destroy these records.Think apps and such. Those who vote for such a call, the City Council might in fact be viewed as complicit in addition to ones they've already uncovered.Thank you. Thank you, Speaker.Evening again, Mr. Mayor. Gary Shelton. My address is on file and I'm really glad the item was pulled. And for the reason it was pulled, it sounds like we have a a good solution to, you know, these things come up every once in a while and they're kind of pro forma in the way they work.And what I appreciate is that what I was concerned about in simply reading the item, which was somehow or another, we need this to be a last call for folks who might think that they have some use for these old records.And that's exactly what's happened. I didn't realize that it was easy, as it seems it's going to be, to create that gap of time for folks who are listening and thinking, Gee, maybe I am interested in finding out what was said or what some internal memos were or some emails, that sort of thing.Issues that have come and gone, which haven't really gone, they're still on our table today in the period is covered by these records are like the disillusion of the RDA, the creation of the housing element and the downtown plan.The Civic Center request for proposals, which is still in the mix right now, has been going on for a long time. The Belmont Pool, Queensway Bay in the park, specifically in regards to replacing the cyclone racer or maybe its access to South Pine some way from North Pine.The Gerald Desmond Bridge is an issue that's been on the in the records for a long time and certainly public safety staffing, which is all part of the budgeting that we've heard and we'll be hearing next week also.So I'm glad to hear that this motion has been made. I think it's fitting that the historical society would be obtaining these records, especially that they would be digitized because that's a really economical way to save records for a very long time.I would ask if there's a way that the public will understand when that digitization, if that's what they're going to do, will come back and if it will be in fact, made public, and how that might be publicized as to what their output becomes.Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker.Good evening. My name is Craig Hendricks, and I am the secretary of the Historical Society of Long Beach. And I just wanted to come here.Tonight and thank the mayor and the city council members for pulling those items off the consent calendar, because a destruction.Of public records should never.Happen, certainly in a city the.Size of Long Beach. And those records are could be very, very valuable in the future. So we really would like to thank you for pulling us off the consent calendar. And we look forward to working with city staff.To find a way to preserve these records. But speaking on behalf of the City of the Historical Society, we will gladly accept these historical records for our archives. So thanks very much.Thank you. Next speaker.Mr. Mayor. No council people. I'm not a resident of Long Beach, but I'm a resident of the great county of Los Angeles in the state of California and a friend of a little plant called Marijuana. And I know it's another agenda item, but I'm concerned about these records, too, because when I was last in the city councilchamber, the mayor asked me to leave because I'm a medical marijuana patient and I'm concerned about the five or six years of those records concerning the all the years I came here and testified as a man living with AIDS for 20 years, that stood up to the federal government and has been in the room with two presidents, one that inhaled and one that didn't, and have the benefits of knowing that 23 states in this country have legalized medical marijuana. And I was just at the White House on the 4th of July for the 45th annual smoking.And if I was to destroy my records of the 20 years of the historical use of AIDS drugs to keep me alive and marijuana to keep me alive, we would have a big problem. So I'm glad to hear the Historical Society.And you have changed your mind about destroying Mayor Foster's records, because I believe my friend Eric Holder and the United States Justice Department might want to subpoena those records and even the records of some of the council people that are now mayors or or our new council people, because there is corruption in the marijuana world, including politics, because the mayor of Upland went to jail recently for his corruption and state Senator Leland Yee, who some of you might know is going to jail for his corruption involving marijuana. And I don't want to say that you, Mr. Garcia, will go to jail in the future like the man over here said, because of your corruption withmarijuana or if you're not corrupt with marijuana. But and I don't know how much of the time I have a minute left. You know, living with AIDS for 20 years hasn't been an easy thing. You know, nausea, vomiting, taking 40 pills a day for many years, taking seven or ten pills a day and having a couple ofpuffs on my medical marijuana makes me hungry. And there's a lot of AIDS patients that live in Long Beach. And you're aware of all the homosexuals and gay people and straight people that have AIDS, aren't you, Mr. Mayor?Garcia Because, you know, Long Beach has the highest incidence of AIDS in the state of California, besides the great city of Los Angeles, where I live, and San Francisco, where my friend Dennis Peron was on the phone with me a few minutes ago.Now, I came here because I'm concerned over you trying to limit things on another issue that I'll speak later, but I want to congratulate this issue. Yeah, I got a couple more minutes. I want to congratulate you, Mr. Mayor, for not throwing me out, for raising my voice a little bit like Mayor Foster.Maybe he was concerned about what they'll find in those records when my friend Eric Holder subpoenas them, because I'm asking the federal government like I did previous times, they're to investigate the entire county of Los Angeles, the city of Long Beach, the city of L.A. and the state of California, for upsetting the will of the rights ofthe people of Proposition 215, which we passed in 1996. Thank you.Sir. You have to identify yourself for the record.Richard Eastman, former HIV AIDS commissioner for the county of Los Angeles, representing 70,000 people living with AIDS in this great county. And I believe Long Beach is there. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker.Good evening, City Council. My name is Patrick Rhodium with the American Patients Rights Association. I just wanted to speak to you because, as you can tell, many medical marijuana groups are very heated over the subject of the X Mares records.And I'd like to thank you guys for pulling these items from the list, because we do not want these records destroyed. There's actually many groups that are interested in the mares records because of the issue that Mr.. He's been just brought to your attention.Yeah, there is a pending federal investigation and there are a lot of groups and a lot of attorneys that are looking forward to seeing the mayor's records. So we highly appreciate the fact that you guys were willing to recall these items, and we're looking forward to reviewing them as soon as they're made available.Thank you very much. We appreciate it.Thank you. There is a motion and a second on the floor. Count's embarrassed. Barossa. You have any comments? Okay with that? Members, please go ahead and cast your votes.

Question comments by members of Council. Councilman Flynn.Thank you, Mr. President. We we heard about this during the all the presentations on the bond issue and the I think the bond team on the 2007 Better Denver Bonds did a fabulous job in transparency and in reporting any change that occurred to what the voters were promised.And I think the biggest one that I can recall was the Belcher concert hall issue that had to be brought back to the council and in fact, was the reason my wife and I voted for the entire package in prior bond issues in 1989.In 98 and in 2007, the companion ordinance and each occasion had included much more extensive lists of the projects that we were going to undertake, that we were telling the voters, You're going to get these things. And this this time around, initially it was proposed that on some of these lists that were bulleted in the companion ordinance, we would say, for example. So that would give more flexibility if changes had to occur down the road. And when I looked at the list, I noticed that any project that was in my district that was listed in the companion audience and remember, were only listing very few of the hundred.Some projects were doing any project for my district that was on this list was on that bulleted list, which meant if anything was deleted out of my district, no one ever had to come back to this council to say, we're not going to do that and here's why and here's what we're going to do instead.So all we're doing here, Mr. President, and this does have the support, even after the the remarks I just made of the administration, what I'm doing is saying that of the projects that are on that list, including the bulleted ones, if they end up unable to do them.They would have to come back to the council and explain why and how they're going to how they're going to reuse those funds. So with that sentence, Mr.. I would ask for my colleagues to join me in supporting this.And and when I have any questions, I just want to verify on the record. Take us all the way. I believe you're representing the the administration on this. You also want to come to that to the mikes, sir.You all are supportive of this amendment.Good evening, President Brooks. Members of Council.Deputy Chief Projects Officer take us all the way in the Mayor's office.We are in support of this amendment moving forward.Okay, great. That's all we need to hear for the record.

I move the council bill 8819 be placed upon final consideration and do pass as amended before we go into voting.I want to give folks a just a chance to make a comment who didn't make a comment last week on the entire package, believed it's a good time to do that. Councilman Clark.Thank you, Mr. President. Yeah, I know we're only voting on the companion ordinance, but that was part of what I wanted to point out, is that for those of you who've been watching and are watching on TV and following all of these projects and have participated in this process at public meetings through our committees and structures thatall of the the bond ordinances are going through on our block vote. And I just didn't want it to go by unnoticed that when we vote on a block, which is a yes, meaning that if nobody called it out at this point, those are going to pass today.That is the near billion dollars worth of infrastructure projects that the community put forward. And I just want to say thank you to the community for everybody who participated to the team, from the administration, for the awesome Bond team that we have, for putting this together and to our council president for working very closely with 13 ofus, I guess 12 not counting yourself and in being that liaison between the mayor's office and council to make sure that tonight we stand here with a group of projects that is so supported that we're not even calling it out for a separate vote.It is on the block vote. So I just wanted to say thank you before I missed my chance, since it's on the block. Yeah.Thank you, Councilman Clarke. And you've been great to be working with on this as well. Thank you, Councilwoman Black.Thank you, Mr. President. I did not comment last week, but everybody else did. So I will be brief. Ditto what Councilman Clark said. I too appreciate the input from all the community members and the hard work of staff and committee members.I submitted all of the hundreds of requests that my constituents provided me and our visioning meetings and through surveys, emails and phone calls. I'm very pleased that some of our requests were added to the list, like improvements to Hampton, Yale and Colorado Boulevard.And Are You Hill's Library? I'm especially excited about the Highline Canal Tunnel at Yale and Holly. It is much needed for safety. Some of my constituents were hoping for a rec center since we only have one very modest one in all of southeast Denver.But for the record, it's not on the list because projects need to be shovel ready. And at this point, we don't even have a location or any plans. So I'm hoping with Denver right and game plan, hopefully we can start more conversations about a future rec center.In the meantime, there are many, many worthwhile projects all across Denver on the list, and all of the investments will then be beneficial to our great city. So I'm very happy to support the 2017 G.O. bond.Excellent. Thank you, Councilwoman Black. And and I'll just say to Councilman Flynn and Cashman and Black and Espinosa, I think we came into this process and and their districts were lacking, to say the least, and just appreciate your inclusiveness in this process and working real hard to get to a good place.And guys, you're about to see something you rarely see on council. 13 votes in favor of $1,000,000,000 plan to improve Denver.

Thank you. I move that council bill 19 Dash 584 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.It has been moved and seconded. The required public hearing for Constable 584 is open. May we have the staff report?Yes. Thank you. Good evening. I am Libby Adams. I'm an associate city planner with community planning and Development, and I'm here to present on the proposed text amendment to the Denver Revised Municipal Code regarding the partial rezoning, a former Chapter 59 planned unit developments.And so in the following slides, we'll talk about the purpose of this text amendment. I'll go through the summary of the existing regulations and what's being proposed. I'll highlight the public process and the feedback we received. I'll talk about how the review, how the proposed tax amendment meets the review criteria and then conclude with the staff recommendation. And this proposed zoning text amendment is sponsored by the Community Planning and Development Executive Director. So the purpose of the text amendment is to revise the Denver Revised Municipal Code to change who may submit an application to rezone a portion of a former Chapter 59 planned unit development.The hope is that this will encourage property property owners in the former Chapter 59 PUD to rezone into districts in the Denver zoning code by simplifying the requirements for who may submit an application. So the under the existing requirement in order for a single property to re zone out of an old code pad.All property owners within that PUD would be required to sign the application under the proposed requirement. Just the applicant who's who's proposing to rezone their property out of the old code would be required to sign the application. So this applies only to applications for portions of former Chapter 59 PDS that would be rezoning into a district inthe Denver zoning code. The existing signatures requirement presents an unnecessary barrier that doesn't exist for other former Chapter 59 properties. So those with waivers and conditions, as well as those unplanned building groups, are all able to submit an application for an individual property.So removing it would level the playing field for all property owners that are within the former Chapter 59 code. So this is an illustration of the existing requirement. So if the property owner of the blue, the property represented in blue would want to rezone out, they would have to get signatures from all eight property owners within thisPWD in order just to submit an application. Under the proposed requirement, the property owner in blue would be the only one required to sign the application in order to apply for rezoning. And this is a map of the former Chapter 59 pads that are in Denver.So the ones in kind of the orange, a yellow color are just one property. So those won't be affected by this text amendment. But the ones in red are multiple properties. So those would potentially be affected by this amendment.So as you can see, it does impact all areas of the city, but is concentrated those in Cherry Creek and then the far northeast. This is just a highlight of the public process. I won't go through everything it was in your staff packet, but I will highlight just a couple of things.So on January seven, this red line and the summary was posted to the Community Planning and Development website as well as an email was sent to registered neighborhood organizations and city council members. Then on January 26th, staff went before the entire Neighborhood Cooperation, Zoning and Planning Committee to present on this topic.And in that meeting, we did learn that they would that the greater agency organization would be meeting on February 9th, which is three days after the originally scheduled planning board hearing. And so in order to allow them to meet as a large organization and come to a formal vote on this matter, we decided to postpone the planningboard hearing. So that's why this process started several months ago. And then we also allowed for more time for public input. So we went to the Montebello Neighborhood Improvement Association meeting on February 20th. And then we're here before you today on August 5th for the city council public hearing.We did receive three public comment emails and one motion from ANC regarding this topic. The first comment was from a private citizen and they were opposed to the text amendment. Their concern was that this would facilitate piecemeal rezoning of former Chapter 59 properties into the Denver zoning code.However, this amendment does not change the process for a rezoning, so any owner applying to rezone a former Chapter 59 PD into the Denver zoning code would have to meet all of the review criteria. And as a part of the rezoning process, community planning and development would make sure there would be no ill effects.And if there would be ill effects on the remainder, then that may be one that staff would recommend denial on. And then the second comment we received was from a registered neighborhood organization, and they were concerned that PDD amendments that were negotiated between the neighborhood and the developer would be nullified if one property were to come out. However, this text amendment will not change any established agreements. Those would still be in place. And then we received one comment from a private citizen in support of the amendment, and then the motion from ANC was in opposition.And so to the criteria for review for a proposed tax amendment are found in section 12 for 1211 of the Denver Zoning Code. And CPD finds that the proposed TEX amendment is consistent with many of the goals, strategies and policies found in comprehensive plan 2040, as well as Blueprint 2019 to highlight a few.The comprehensive plan calls for improved, equitable access to city resources and city meetings, and to adopt strategies to ensure city plans and processes incorporate equity as well as promoting infill development where infrastructure and services are already in place.So this text amendment promotes equity by putting property owners in the former Chapter 59 Code RPD on a level playing field with all other property owners that are still in old code districts by allowing them to individually apply for rezoning.And then it promotes infill development by eliminating a barrier that currently inhibits the development of former Chapter 59 Pwds and then Blueprint Denver 2019 specifically encourages incentivizing property owners in the former Chapter 59 code to rezone to the Denver Zoning Code.And this text amendment does just that. It's one way it simplifies the requirements for applications, making it easier for property owners to come in to the new code. And then staff also finds that the Tech Summit furthers the public health, safety and general welfare of the city by providing all property owners within the old code an equalopportunity to apply for rezoning. So the requirement for consent from all property owners within a former Chapter 59 PD to apply for a rezoning does not exist for other former Chapter 59 properties. In addition, under the proposed amendment, properties would be subject to the rezoning process and the Denver Zoning Code, which requires a more frequent and extensivenotification process to property owners and registered neighborhood organizations than that of the former Chapter 59 Code. And then finally CPD finds the text amendment will result in regulations that are uniform in each district. More specifically, the amendment will result in uniform application requirements for all properties in the former Chapter 59 code proposing to rezone into the Denverzoning code. So staff has reviewed the proposed tax amendment for compliance based on the review criteria and has found the amendment satisfies each of the three review criteria. So staff recommends the Denver City Council approve the partial rezonings of former Chapter 59 planned unit development text amendment to the Denver Revised Municipal Code.And that concludes staff presentation.Thank you very much. We have seven individuals signed up to speak this evening. If you signed up to speak on this item, I'd ask that you come up to this front bench so that you're ready. When I call your name to step up to the microphone and your time will start.First up, we have Merrill Carter. And again, I'd ask if you've signed up to come up here because you're you're going to lose some time if you're not ready to jump up.So I'm concerned with the fact that we the city, is giving state money to these corporations. I'm not. I've been an addiction counselor here.And I'm sorry, sir, but this is for the rezoning for chapter 59. I'm sorry. If you'd like to sign up for a courtesy hearing about those items, check in with our council secretary. But that's not what this hearing is for.Okay. Thank you. Next up, Michael Anderson.They could kill two members of her. Allow me to speak to you. Address you this evening. I'm going to read for some notes that I took in my purpose for being here as support of the Core and Geo Geo.Again, unfortunately, that's not this hearing. I think you signed up for the wrong one. We have to this evening so we can check in with the council secretary. She'll get you signed up for the right hearing. Thank you very much.Next up, Chairman. Thank you.My name's is Sekou. I represent the Black Sox Movement for Self-defense. Couple of questions. I can see was in opposition to this change. And. I heard nothing in the staff report about that letter of opposition in terms of why they are opposed to this, since it's such a good idea and they represent.When it comes to getting community input, they're much better at doing that and getting more people involved than the people who were given the report. It would seem to me that something of this nature. You would expect for their meetings to reflect that in terms of the number of people who actually attended the meeting.That's not in the report. So we don't know whether it was one person at the meeting or at Montebello. We don't know what was a community engagement with that Arnaud to get people to that meeting. And so I'm kind of lost there because after 15 years, that is some justice just gonna slip in here with this onehere. And my last concern is this when we're talking about property owners and we're talking about people who actually own multiple unit dwellings as property owners in these areas that we wanted to do the zoning zoning change. It was my understanding that when I pay rent with I own the property or not, then I'm doing the thingsthat the property owners are required to do that don't do that. I do that. So how come I'm not included in this as being a resident who has approved this thing? My boys ain't even are, but I'm paying for all of this.So what's going on here with this sale? Is this class legislation for just the rich and we don't matter. And then you asked for our opinion. But then you don't. And then we're paying for all of this because as a renter, I'm paying taxes, too, and I'm paying property taxes.Taxes on the property. But you don't talk to me about none of this. And you want to pass this mess for real. This shouldn't even be considered out of the sense of equity and justice to the people who are paying taxes.This is crazy. But this is what we do down here, because you dismissed the people who matter the most and recruit the people who don't matter to most. Property owners don't even live in the city county of Denver.So you talk to me and you tell me I'm lying about this mess.I'm sorry, but your time is up. Next up, Jesse Paris.Jesse Pierce, represented for Denver Homicide, a low black star action movement for self-defense and positive action commitment for social change. And I was on top of the battle for our lives this past May 2019 election by almost 15,000 votes with no money.We are neither for or against this. I wanted to know exactly who is going to benefit is going to benefit the property owners. We know this. So it's going to make it easier for them to do a rezoning.So if they want to do a upscaling of their property, they will not have to notify their immediate neighbors surrounding business owners of this to get their application approved. Is that correct? Is that what I'm understanding? So I have that question.Is that whether.It's going to happen?This is just your comments in national section.How would this factor in with potential tiny home villages and encampments? Would a property owners be able to change the rezoning to allow for these things to even be possible or to use or any other attainable housing that our property owners might want to do if they actually cared about our housing crisis?That's my question. Thank you.Thank you. Next up, Amy, former. Oh. Amy disappeared? Nope. Okay. We'll get her moved over to the other one, Brian Conley.Evening Council. I'm Brian Connolly. As some of you know, I'm a land use planner and land use lawyer with the firm of Otten, Johnson, Robinson, Neff and Ragan. Eddie, I am not here this evening on behalf of one single client, but on behalf of several of our clients who have been in the position of being in propertiesthat are under former Chapter 59 pads, but that have sought rezonings out of those pads. And so therefore we are here fully in support of this amendment, which is very much a common sense amendment. I think there are three underlying reasons that we would encourage your support.The first is that this amendment would allow a conversation to begin when a landowner desires to rezone out of a former Chapter 59 district, as Ms.. Adams presented very well. Any landowner who wants to even start that conversation has to first get the signatures of every person who owns property within the party to even file an application. So it allows the conversation to begin. It allows your professional staff to review those applications, and it allows those conversations to come forward to you. The second reason we support this is that this or this amendment would be consistent and make Denver consistent with every other jurisdiction in the state of Colorado in which we've worked.There is no other jurisdiction in the state that requires every landowner within a party to consent to a rezoning of it. It allows parcel by parcel rezonings. And the third reason that we are supportive of this amendment is that many landowners who find themselves with amputees, who require the support of all the other owners, find themselves ina position of of being assaulted by those other owners. For amendments, we've been in the position where you have maybe one holdout landowner who does not want to consent to a piece of the amendment, but will only do so on the condition that he or she is paid a certain amount of money to consent to the amendment. And so that prevents several, at least in our experience, has presented several meritorious projects from moving forward, everything from grocery stores in communities that are underserved with grocery stores to affordable housing projects, projects that would involve the creation of new public space.So for all those reasons, we think this is very much a common sense amendment. We thank your staff for bringing this forward. It's something that for a long time we observed was an issue. And so we would very much respectfully request your support of this amendment.Thank you.Thank you. That concludes our speakers. Are there questions for members of council? Comes from black.Thank you, Mr. President. Libby, I have a question for you, first of all. Great presentation. Thank you. While we don't always get that. So my question was about PBGC plan building groups. And I feel like I heard you say that this applies to PBDEs.Is that true?So you as like an individual property owner in a PBGC, you could apply to rezone to a new district, but you would still remain in the planned building group. So this doesn't change the plan. To get out of the plan to building group, you would still have to have all of the required signatures.Okay. And is CPD working on perhaps changing that? Annalise It's sort of like you might have an answer to that. I happen to have a lot of those in my district.In there currently that's not on the work program on what we're committing to, but it's something that we might evaluate further. PB Jesus and parties are quite different in nature because a PBJ is essentially a site specific development plan that has more detailed elements such as drainage and landscaping and parking.And so there's a little bit more nuance that goes into those. So right now we're not proposing any changes, but we can follow up with you more on that.Okay. Thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman Black. Councilwoman CdeBaca.Thank you, Mr. President.Can you tell us.Or.Describe a real example.Of one of these pads and perhaps how it didn't allow us to do something beneficial to.The community?Certainly. So in Council District 11, the far northeast, there is pad 319. Let me see if I can pull it up here. Um. Let's see. Here it is. So it's Green Valley Ranch, and then the park is split by Pena Boulevard.And this park does not allow for a grocery store. It specifically says no grocery stores. And I believe several years ago, there was a proposal to put a grocery store in this park and it was unable to happen because there are so many owners in this party that they would have had to get hundreds of signatures andwith property owners constantly changing. They were stuck with the development that the city currently calls for.Thank you.Thank you. Councilwoman CdeBaca. Councilman Flynn.Thank you, Mr. President. Libby, can you. One of the concerns I've had is this work through the process is exactly what you spoke to about and what some of the opposition is rooted in, which is all the property owners in appear to have a common interest in some of the agreements and the waivers and conditions.And I know that your answer was, well, staff would likely not put forward a change requested by a single owner within a payday to to make a change that might alter those agreements that were made. I think the R.A. cited that.The one R.A. and I can see. Can you speak to what other safeguards are in place, if any, other than just a staff review before it comes to us? Because we would be the final wall protecting the other owners in a PD from losing some of their their their rights.Yeah, certainly. So in this PD 319, for example, there are development agreements and so for roadway improvements and things like that. And so those would still remain in place if the one see the kind of the larger property at Green Valley Ranch and Pena Boulevard were to rezone out so we could have a grocery store.So there are other agreements or infrastructure master plans that would keep some of those things in place.So the rezoning would not nullify an impact. So in that sense, to go back to Councilwoman Black's question, it wouldn't, you know, if you were in a planned building group, you would still be bound, even though today I have a PBGC at my old Target village, for instance, with several other properties in it.If one of those property owners wanted to rezone out of the old B3, which is old chapter 59, then you're saying that they would still be bound by all the requirements in the plan building?Correct, yes. So they would still have to file the plan building group, but they could apply to rezone to a different to.Do another use perhaps or some. Okay. All right. Thank you. That's Thomas President.Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Hines.Thank you, Mr. President. Question Are there any current pwds in the country club neighborhood?So there are two, I believe, and I think they may be single owner. Let me. One may actually just be outside the bounds. Oh, this isn't close enough, is it? On a lease may be looking here, but I think there might be one or just two.And while you're looking, the reason why I'm asking the question I think, you know, is that the the one R.A. that voted that it registered opposition other than ANC is the country club historic neighborhood. So I'm our country club neighborhood organization so I'm kind of filling time so the analyst can do a little more searching.But so I guess I'll ask another question. Why might a neighborhood that doesn't have a lot of affected, why might an R.A. take a position against if this R.A. doesn't have a lot of or can you help provide additional context as to why Country Club might have voted against?Yeah.So I think's the PDS that I'm thinking of May. If they're not in country club, they're right on the border. So it could have been that when the parties were first established, the neighborhood had an agreement with the developer that was adjacent to their neighborhood.Okay. And so this obviously country club's in Converse Perfect ten. So I want to make sure that I understand and listen to their concerns as well. If we were to have future zoning variances, which I'm again, I think what I think you've just answered this with Councilman Flynn, but I just want to make sure I understand countryclub R.A. would have all the same protections as they would if this weren't a party like you. Just go this the same regular zoning process.Correct. Yeah. So they would still get the referral and they would be able to comment on the project? Correct.Okay. Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Hines, are no other questions? The public hearing for Council Bill 584 is closed. Are there any comments by members of council? Well, not everybody jump in at the same time. All right. Seeing no comments. Madam Secretary.Raquel.Black Eye. CdeBaca. I.Flint High.Gilmer. I. Herndon. I. Paint.I.Can each. Ortega. I. Sandoval. I swear. I. Torres. I. 12.I didn't get to vote. I mean, I voted on here. But you.Didn't ask.Mr. President.Okay, I. Madam Secretary, please vote in the results. Now, I think we have 12. Thank you. 12 eyes. Gainesville, 584 has passed. Councilman Flynn, will you please put Council Resolution 673 on the floor?\nReasoning:",

And we're here to talk about a project in the vice mayor's district. Uh, this project is on Pacific Coast Highway. It involves a former redevelopment property that was then transferred to the successor agency.And through a competitive process, was awarded to Mercy Housing. Mercy Housing acquired the adjacent property, a former auto facility. And they're turning that piece of land into a 68 unit affordable project. The Affordable Housing Project has already been approved by staff and the Planning Commission.And what's in front of council tonight is the technical matter of changing the zone on the property to a zone that allows for this residential use. So it'd be from c h w to cc n. Um, and the effect of that would be consistent with the existing adopted land use element and would allow for this positive development. This is going to be a project that provides high quality housing to seniors of limited means. It's a very attractive design that was complimented by both the public and our planning commission and planning staff. And it's being done using modular construction, which is the exciting way to lower the cost of delivering housing projects throughout the city andthroughout the state of California. Um, so I could go on, but it's all positive regarding, um, this project. So I'm going to pause here and answer any questions that the Council may have.Thank you. I'm going to go ahead and go to public comment. Madam Clerk, first.Yes. Our first speaker is Erika Villar Blanca. Your time starts now.Hi. Good afternoon. Good evening, Mayor. And Members of the City Council. My name is Erika Blanca, and I'm the director of real estate development for Mercy Housing, California. Thank you for your time this evening.Our Long Beach.Senior Housing Project will provide 67 units of much needed affordable housing to low income seniors.Aged.62 and over.We'd like.To extend our thanks to the Planning Department and city staff for all their efforts in working with us to.Get to this point.We're very excited about this project and have received a lot of support from the community since we first started reaching out to immediate neighbors and other organizations about a year ago last August.Together with our architecture.Team, Studio 111, I'm here to answer any questions you may have, and we're looking forward.To the day our.Vulnerable seniors will be able to call this place home. Thank you.Thank you. Our next speaker is Myron Wolin.Hello. I am the president of the Long Beach Gray Panthers, a senior advocacy group in Long Beach. I want to speak in favor of the council approving the zoning change so that the proposed housing project by Mercy Housing can be built in Long Beach.The project will provide housing for 68 units for homeless seniors and veterans in Long Beach. As we all know, there is a homeless crisis in Long Beach. There is a need for housing for the homeless, especially homeless seniors.Today we see seniors who are homeless in Long Beach, and we expect a 13% increase in senior homelessness this year. In the future, we expect the problem to get worse. And seniors living below the poverty line increase and to be almost 25% of all seniors in five years.You can be sure there will be a subsequent increase in homelessness. The project will be an asset to the neighborhood and probably improve it. The new housing will transform a site that is currently vacant into new housing that will help serve as a new anchor for the neighborhood.Within a short walk of less than a half a mile, a bus lines, parks, medical clinics and senior services at Long Beach City College. In addition, this housing will include indoor community rooms for residents and an outdoor courtyard.It will also be secured bike parking. We call on the council to approve this item with all the museum's amenities. And thank you for your consideration.Thank you. Our next speaker is Karen Reside.This is Karen Recite also with the Long Beach Gray Panthers. And we have been advising Mercy Housing on this project since they started the outreach to the community. The Gray Panthers support the approval of this project and the rezoning.This project.Is going to be built.In a much.Needed area that will eliminate blight that has been longstanding in the community and begin the process of implementing really a corridor for affordable housing with some other projects that are coming on board. Mercy Housing has been a wonderful partner to work with.They have engaged the community from the beginning and they are going to be providing community benefits with this project. They are also including local artists by including their art in the decor, which will be resident selected. The language Gray Panther supports the development of additional projects by mercy housing.For older adults like this project, as well as other developers.We now know that there is not enough housing for seniors in our community. The waitlist for on affordable housing are now from 5 to 10 years.Way too long for seniors.Who may not make it.Until that point.So we support the City Council on changing the zoning for this particular project. Thank you.Thank you. Our next speaker is Jordan Wynn.Hi there this is Jordan win with the everyone in campaign speaking in support of the 67 new units being built at Long Beach senior by Mercy Housing. We're seeing housing has been a wonderful community partner with everyone in and within the Long Beach community that has over the past few years engaged the community in very constructive andincredible ways to really make one be senior, a dedicated community space that will be a shining star along the Pacific Coast Highway. This comes at the heels of other affordable and supportive housing projects being built in the same area.And it is a welcome and much needed sight for our citizens and Long Beach. Miami Beach has a ongoing homelessness crisis that has been exacerbated by COVID 19. Many individuals, including seniors, find themselves vulnerable on the street with very little protection from the virus, from other health complications and very few.Resources for housing.I'm using your help to provide a safe place for refuge for many of those people who have been previously dealing with homelessness and gives them a road to recovery by a supportive housing. What we see here is a shining star.Honestly, within our community, it will be one of the best new projects being put up in the city. And I'm really excited to see a site that has been empty for the past, you know, at least ten years or so, ever since I was going to be passing by there.Could not think of a better use than converting that into supportive and affordable housing for our previously homeless and needy needs. So I'm speaking in support of Lumbee Senior. I hope everyone on the council will do the same.Thank you very much.Thank you. That concludes public comment for this item.Okay with that, I'm going to turn this over to Vice Mayor Andrews and a second.Thank you, ma'am. First of all, I want to let everyone know I'm very supportive of this project and this line of thinking. Since we tore down the blight, in fact, illicit activities, it took a long time to find the right operators for this site, and I am glad that I have the process brought mostly housing as arecommendation. We have seen that our senior homeless population is increasing and I've seen on most of the operators at St Mary's Towers, they've done a great job there. I'm hopeful that we're going to have a beautiful project along PCH corridor and I would like to thank Mercy Housing Team for engaging with the community throughout the entire process, answering questions the town and looking to transform this intersection. So I'm looking forward to breaking ground, and I invite my colleagues to please support me in approving this project. Thank you, ma'am.Thank you. I have count some of your anger. You have a second?Yes. Fully supporter of the project. Thank you.Thank you. Councilmember Price.I was just queuing up the second. I'm supportive as well, I think.Great. Thank you.

Citywide.So moves and day has.Second. Thank you. Any further comment on this item? Yes, we have Devin Appleyard.Know.Hello. Honorable Vice Mayor and City Council. My name is Devin Apple and I'm business. I am representing approximately 3000 language city employees. I'll start by thanking you all for your advocacy in the negotiations process in many ways. This is as generous an offer one can expect during a public health and financial crisis like we are facing.And for that, we are truly grateful. I must, however, address a few important points. The first being for those unions like ours who do not represent public safety or who had yet to close out our contract before COVID 19, we not only were hit with a larger furlough schedule than Alvey, but we were also forced into areopening. Our concern is not only that the city has asked for less of a contribution from Alvey, but that the money not taken from Alvey now may be taken again from all of us when the city decides it needs further austerity.The only reason I can see for the city manager to avoid opening their contract was to limit your input on the matter. Second, we heard that you were told the delays in voting on this were because we were being picky and unreasonable.We disagree. The city volunteered to clean up the language, in particular regarding inclusive gender expressions. Unfortunately, when we received the document Uber to vote on substantial changes have been made that were not presented to or voted on by our membership.These changes would have voided the ratification vote our members might have just held. And lastly, and this is really the most important note of the evening over the term of this contract, we will be organizing around an issue that is of the utmost importance.The treatment of part time non-career employees. More and more, the city is shifting full time classified work to non-career employees who are denied benefits or any type of job security. City jobs used to be one of the best path for Disenfranchized communities to reach the middle class and achieve the American dream.But now those pathways are being cut off and our public servants are being relegated to minimum wage jobs with no hope of receiving disability parental leave recently, or health benefits while they're on the front during a national health crisis.We can't even list all the basic protections you and I enjoy that they do not receive. And some folks serve in non-career positions for upwards of 20 years. They are not given priority when full time jobs open up.And the Civil Service Commission just voted to allow the city to bypass them and fill classified positions with non-career employees. In a time where council is discussing inclusion and reconciliation, we are the only union that have to tell over a thousand of our members that they will not be receiving receiving the benefits we just negotiated for everyoneelse. Benefits that many would consider a baseline for city employees. Your constituents are asking that you invest in the community and that you build an infrastructure for the future. The decisions you make today are the foundation of the future, of how services are delivered to our communities.When they ask you to invest in the community. This is a large part of that. Your employees, all of them are a part of this city. They are part of the fabric of what makes Long Beach. Long Beach.Given all of this, we do feel encouraged that you ratify our MCU. Please stay safe, healthy. And thank you for your time this evening.Thank you. That concludes public.Comment for the. Thank you. Okay. Would you please go after the vote?District one.

Congratulations. Okay. Councilwoman Sussman, last. Bill, will you please put council bill 597 on the floor?With pleasure, Mr. President. I move the bill 597 to be placed on file consideration and do pass.It has been moved. And second it the public hearing for Council Bill 597 is now open. May we have the staff report? Ms.. Lucero. Yes. All right.Final bill for tonight is one reason this is actually the final rezoning and Berkeley Annex, which is cause for celebration. It is approximately 99 Monica Street Parkway from oh one to G mix three general urban mixed use three story.It is in this portion. I'm on the illustrative Berkeley Annex plan. The Purple Circle is the illustrated area where we are talking about this evening. And now I'm on the Buckley Annex history slide from 1970 to 2005. This property was part home of the Air Reserve Police Personnel Center and Defense Financing and Accounting Services, which had 3000employees. And that was the sole use on this 70 acre property. In 1993, the Lowry reuse plan was created, 2000 Comprehensive Plan was created in 2000 to Blueprint. Denver was adopted, and then in 2005, the Air Force decided to close these facilities.So a lot of our plans didn't anticipate that the Buckley Annex redevelopment plan was completed by Lowry Redevelopment Authority, and it did provide a framework for land use and transportation on the property. The property was officially vacated in 2010 and turned over in 2012 to the Lowry Redevelopment Authority.And then in 2013, the city did excuse us. This city did approve a general development plan for the property and a minor amendment later on. So we are north of Bayard Avenue. I'm on location slide now north of Baird Avenue, south of First Avenue, spanning Lowry, the extension of Lowry Boulevard and east of the Monica Street Parkway. Onto the request. The property is about eight acres. It is currently vacant. I just want to point out that we finally have a 2016 aerial. You'll see some of the building already going on in Buckley Annex on this slide and you probably won't see it on the rest of my slides, which are 2014 aerials.So the property is currently vacant. Again, the property owner is Lowry Redevelopment Authority and they propose to rezone the property and then sell it for development. The general urban context characterized by multi-unit and a variety of building forms, low scale commercial and added and intended to promote safe, active pedestrian scaled areas.This one zone district that's currently here was carried over in 2010, as it is, is an old institutional zone district and was left in place kind of as a holding to leave the property and sort of holding because we were at the time updating the library plan.So it never was changed. The maximum height is 75 feet if you're within 175 feet of a protected zone district. And the only uses allowed were residential care and shelter for the homeless civic uses or outdoor recreation or entertainment, and a few industrial uses like telecommunications, oil and gas production or wholesale trade.So moving on to existing context, zoning, the site has been surrounded this piece by piece with new zone districts. In Berkeley Annex you see the urban single unit to the North Grange. Three are General Urban Rowhouse three Story to the East.The Jim U. Five We just approved not too many months ago for affordable housing to the south south of Bayard Avenue is our to a with waivers that is a combination of seven story towers and two story townhomes in front of it.And then, of course, across the street is Chris Moore Park, which has an open space zoning next land use. Under existing context, the site is showing up as vacant multi-family residential to the South Park to the west. And this gives you an idea of these pictures under building form and scale of what's being built in the onon the on the annex. We see on the upper right some new single family homes, some townhomes under construction on the lower right. The seven story towers are south across Bayard on the bottom. The site itself, which is vacant.And then, of course, Chris Moore park above that on the left. So and summary of our review. And this is interesting. This is just the city agency review, which is summarized in your in your staff report. And all of the city agencies did recommend approval of this.So under our public notice, the notice of complete application went out in May. Planning Board public hearing was August 3rd. So with a vote of 7 to 0, planning board did recommend approval. The Land Use Committee heard this on August 16th and did pass it on to council.These are the registered neighborhood organizations that were notified today. We have seven letters of support that should have been in your packet and one letter today received today that was in opposition to this rezoning that I did forward on to your staff to be forwarded to you.So review criteria slide consistency with adopted plans, uniformity of district regulations furthering the public health, safety and welfare justifying circumstances. Consistency with neighborhood context and zone district purpose and intent. Under criteria, the plans that apply to this property are Denver.Denver Comprehensive Plan 2000, the Lowry Reuse Plan Blueprint, Denver and the Buckley Annex General Development Plan. The consistency with current plan is detailed in your staff report. I'm on the blueprint. Denver's slide land use concept was employment because at the time Blueprint Denver was adopted, the Air Force was still occupying the property and we thought they wouldstay. So there is it's it was designated an area of employment, but also an area of change, because we thought maybe someday there would be some change and the Air Force might not stay on to street. Classification Board Avenue is an undesignated local.Monica Street Parkway is a residential arterial where we want to emphasize mobility over access. First Avenue to the north is a collector. Monica Parkway is also an enhanced transit corridor where we want to encourage transit, supportive land uses and practices like shared parking and things like that.So the Lowry reuse plan adopted in 93 and then re adopted with current plan in 2000, again, we didn't anticipate that the Air Force would leave. And so there is very little guidance in those plans to the current circumstances.So the Buckley Annex General Development Plan, this is in the neighborhood center west sub area. And this is a sub area that is intended to to respect the Monaco Parkway with a 35 foot setback, preserves some of the existing stormwater basins along Monica.A nonresidential would be located on Lowry Boulevard, facing Lowry Boulevard and not facing the parkway. And there would be no secondary signage on park. Monica. The land uses were determined to be mixed use residential retail office or civic.Maximum height of five stories, although three stories were recommended along Monica Parkway and then building signs. Setbacks on Monica Parkway from the Crest Moore neighborhood were also included in the GDP and build to lines again would be from Lowry Boulevard, not for Monica.So the neighborhood context. So with that, Steph believes that the criteria for adoption for the adopted consistency with adopted plans is met. I am now on to review criteria for with this, which is consistency with neighborhood context and zone district purpose and intent.Again, the neighborhood context is general urban characterized by multi-unit residential in a variety of building forms. Low scale commercial embedded in residential areas. Residential uses primarily located on local or arterial streets. Commercial located along mixed use and arterial or main streets generally in a grid pattern with detached sidewalks.Buildings typically oriented to shallow, shallow setbacks on the primary street. And balancing pedestrian, bicycle and vehicle use. So staff believes this zone district complies with that. And the zone we already did. So the specific intent of the DMX three zone district.It's a mixed use zone district with a maximum height of three stories. Acting as an active, pedestrian, skilled area embedded within neighborhoods now believes that criteria is met. So again, do believe that the this proposal conforms with the adopted plans, that it furthers the uniformity of district regulations, and that by implementing our plans furthers the public health, safety and welfare. Justifying circumstances is changed conditions. The land or its surrounding environs has changed or is changing to a degree that it's in the public interest to to further redevelop or recognize the changed character of the area.With the redevelopment of the Hall Berkeley Annex, this is a changed condition with the closure of the Air Force facilities. So staff believes this the changed conditions is the appropriate justifying circumstance and we didn't really talk about the context.So with all of that, staff recommends approval that believes all of the criteria have been met.Thank you, Mr. Lucero. We have two speakers this evening. The first one has already jumped up. Mr. Marcus Faulkner. And you have 6 minutes.Good evening. Good evening. Council President. Council members. My name is Marcus Partner 7290 East First Avenue, Denver. I'm a consultant to the Library Redevelopment Authority. I'm actually only our only speaker tonight. Dave Andrews from LRA and John Putnam of our legal team are here for questions.Tricia did such a thorough job on this. I just want to highlight a few things, particularly maybe a little snapshot on this Monaco parcel. I want to get at why we arrived or how we arrived at GMAC's three.Interesting to note in all of our presentations and actually in the GDP, this has been shown as a C-Max five zone district, a more intense five story development. So this is effectively a down zoning from a planning component of a five story to a three story.The reason we ended up here is actually part of a community collaborative process, particularly with Chris, more neighbors across the street. We work with the Cress Moore Park second filing, looked in the park, stood in the park, actually hung balloons to show the height of a five storey building and how it might impact the park and theirviews across Monaca and really worked with them to understand the impact on that. We also made a commitment to the community, all of the neighborhoods surrounding this site, that we would not exceed 800 residential units on Boulevard one.We agreed to do an RFP to the development community first and actually come back with this final rezoning that actually is tailored to the market and the planning principles. To our great surprise and great benefit, we went to the market and we found what we believe will be hopefully a for sale condo development.Three story on this site. We think it is a terrific compromise for the community, a great project and a great culmination to the Boulevard one. So we. Believe, for all the reasons Teresa covered today, that we certainly have consistency with adopted plans and that this three story gimmick is the right solution for this site.And I could share many more about the 60 plus community meetings that we've had. But certainly, as you can see, the lack of fanfare means that this has been a community collaborative process. The last thing I'd like to just mentioned in passing, Teresa noted that this is the last rezoning of Boulevard One.It is actually the last rezoning of the Lowry Redevelopment Authority. This is our 61st and final rezoning application to effectuate the building of 1800 acres. We did our first rezoning in 1995 with Councilwoman Flowback, and I think now we have 10,000 residents, 5000 residential units, and 35,000 people work, live or play on a daily basis in Lowry. It is certainly pretty remarkable. And we want to thank all of you for your leadership and support on this, probably to note, because of what we've been focusing on, maybe our lasting legacy is there are 1082 permanent affordable housing units at Lowry.So with all of that, we'd certainly appreciate your support on this zoning tonight. Thank you very much.Great. Thank you. Mr. Faulkner and John Putnam. Good evening, Mr. President and council members. My name is John Putnam.I am an attorney.For the Library Redevelopment Authority. I'm here.For questions.And my address is 1675 Broadway. Thank you. Thank you. All right. That ends our speakers questions for members of council. All right. Councilman Ortega.I just noticed that you brought a schematic and wanted to know if you would share that with us.I will be happy to. Councilman Ortega, this is the site Boulevard one. Obviously, we are talking about this parcel today, the Monaco parcel, both sides of Lowry Boulevard. This is the rest of the 70 acres of Boulevard one.This second schematic, which was really just an interesting note, these are the 61 rezonings, the different zoning clarify classifications on the entire site, including now the eight different zone districts in Boulevard one.Thank you.You bet. And we held them behind the camera.I think we I think we may have got you on that camera there. Okay, Councilman Flynn.Thank you, Mr. President. Theresa, I just have a.Couple of clarification questions. My OCD brain kind of rebelled at the address on this. 99 Monaco. 99 Monaco would be on the west side of this.I know.But how did it get that address?Because in the assessor record, it's an entirely different address. I just wanna make sure we're not making a mistake.Raise this at committee. It was given to the applicant. Write it in with that. I have to confess that stuff. I was paying more attention to the legal description to make sure that was correct.That's what Matt and.I was to the address. It should have been something like 98. Yes, approximately, given the side of the street that it's on. So that was a staff.I may have to vote no because of that. I'm struggling. The other the other issue was you mentioned that that you received one letter of in opposition and but I couldn't find it in my email today. Can you tell us who that was from Margaret?You know.It was a Weissmann. I don't remember her first name.It was from Michelle Weissman, I believe actually a resident of Boulevard One. Her question was to be sure that there were proper setbacks in this rezoning to actually protect the mountain views looking to the West. Of course, we are complying with the underlying setbacks, but it was a request of the LRA to have more ample setback.An additional setback than what we're providing.Here. Well, she suggested 10 to 15 feet. I apologize. I don't know the setback in this zone district.Thank you. At that time, Theresa, unless you have more that that would be all I had.I was just going to say that the setback along Monaco, per the GDP, is 35 feet, but there is an additional 45 feet. From.Okay. 45 feet along Monaco, in addition.Actually, Dave is reminding me that it is when you combine everything. It's one.100. I read that in the staff report. 100 watts is set back on the east side then that that the opponent was was talking about.If you'll give me a moment to get my zoning code.Okay. I'm going to let Councilwoman Susman chime in here. She wanted.Well, I was just going to talk to Kevin. And Councilwoman Black had also raised this in committee about the 99 Monaco Parkway. And in fact, it's probably going to have an address on Lowry Boulevard, which isn't there yet.So it was probably a, you know, conundrum, conundrum for the applicant about what the address is.So I should just grin and bear it.Yes. Sure. I would actually like to add some give you a little level of comfort. It actually says approximately 99, Monaco, which is this this is approximately 99. And it's a marketing move. Right. You think you're moving into the park?Thank you.Was that your come.Specific set back?Yes.Okay. So for dynamics three, I'm assuming that well, for the primary street, which will be Lowry Boulevard, there is no set back. Right. Actually, for the site interior on either side. There is no set back. Unless they're adjacent to a protected district, which would be ten feet.Right.It's okay. And the letter of opposition requested. How much of a setback?15.15 from. Okay. Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you. Councilman Espinosa, did you say your coming or. You know, yes, the answer was sort of there. But I you wanted my question was simply was what? I assume Monaco has a parkway set back. What is that actual number?I believe it's 20 feet.20 feet. So and then they're obligated to go the full 100.Well, they've obligated themselves to. Okay, great. 100.No, thank you. Okay. All right. Any other questions for members of council? The public hearing for Council Bill 597 is now closed. Comments by members of Council.Councilwoman Sussman Thank you very much, Mr. President. It's a it's quite an evening when Marcus said that this would be the last zoning. One would hope, but never can tell. There might be some more zoning, but it is though it is the last zoning of the new areas.Certainly there might be some rezonings and it gives me a little bit of reflection because I started working on Lowry in 1992 as a one of those pesky neighborhood advocates worried about what it meant because the Air Force base was closing.And as I have spent many, many years with the Lori Authority working on this and am so proud of what the city has accomplished, what Laurie Authority has accomplished, what the neighborhood's neighbors have accomplished, because Lori is, if not the most successful, one of the most successful infill developments of a closing military base in the United States, and is an example of how you redo a military base only when you have lots of participation, but regional participation and not only neighborhood participation, which has happened a great deal here. So it's a it's a sweet moment to think that it's the last zoning and it is the last zoning of the new areas and very happywith what the Planning Office has done. And the olive trees has been there on this since 1992 as well, though we're both only about 35, so that the math doesn't work all that much, but all the work that everybody has done on this and and it's it's an interesting we need to go out and celebrate.Thank you. And I urge my fellow council persons to approve.Yeah, thank you, Councilwoman Sussman, because as soon as I have you in here. Is this from Prior? Yeah, I do think that's okay. Great. Any other comments from members of Council? Madam Secretary, actually, I'd just like to say congratulations.I think in the five years that I've been a part of this, we have had several of these rezonings go through and we've heard a lot of the story. And so thanks for your diligent work. Congratulations. I'll be voting in support of this Council.Madam Secretary.I. Black. Hi, Mark. All right. Espinosa, I.Flynn, I.Gillmor, I. Herndon. I can.

That's the property on the left primary. Most of the structures are one story in height. Single unit on Albion Street. And this went before the planning board. On February 2nd.It was approved unanimously and is before you tonight. So far we have received one letter of support from the Greater Park Hill community, Arnelle, and as well as three letters of support from the public which are attached to the staff report.And there are several review review criteria that are analyzed that we look from the Denver zoning code. The first one is Kansas City with adopted plans. And we're looking at specifically three plans, which is comprehensive plan 2040 Blueprint Denver, a language transportation plan of 2019 and the Park Hill Neighborhood Plan of 2000.There are several strategies and goals that are consistent with this specific rezoning that are specified in the staff report. And I would jump into Blueprint Denver. So Blueprint Denver classifies this area as urban, which is the neighborhood context as classifies it as predominantly residential.And homes are typically low scale single and two unit residential with some small scale multi-unit residential. When you're looking at the future place type classification, it is classified as residential low, which is predominantly single and two unit uses and accessory dwelling units are appropriate.Albion Street is a local street which is categorized as residential uses. And when we look at the growth area strategy, it's classified as all other areas of the city where we anticipate 10% of new employment and 20% of new housing here.Likewise in blueprint under the line you built form housing policy number four it states diversity of housing choice to the expansion of addus use throughout all residential areas. When we jump into the Park Hill neighborhood plan under the land use zoning section, it does mention on page 32 about maintaining the existing integrity of the residential character parkhere and ensuring the continued growth of development in Park Slope results in a balancing compatible mix of housing types as well as action number and Ozone three, which is create and maintain a mix of housing types that are attractive and affordable.And under review criteria two, two, three, two, three and five. It is consistent as found in the staff report and under the fourth criteria which is justifying circumstances, is based off a city adapted plan as blueprint calls for allowing accessory dwelling units in all residential areas.Therefore, CPD recommends the approval based on all the findings of the review criteria. Having met staff is available for any questions that you might have. Thank you.Thank you. We have one individual signed up to speak this evening, Jessie Paris joining us online.

Maintenance Assessment District A1. A1. Marina Cove.Hello again, Madam Mayor, and members of the City Council. I'm Liz Acord, management analyst with the Public Works Department. This item requests that council hold a public hearing and then approve the engineer's report, confirming the diagram and assessment and ordering the levy of assessments for the Marina Cove Maintenance Assessment District.This is the last step in the routine legal process we go through each year to collect assessments for the district. Marina Cove has been an assessment district since its formation in 2002. It is approximately 83 homes in a park, and this assessment district helps fund the maintenance of the city park as well as sidewalk and landscaping maintenance. We recommend the Consumer Price Index increase of 2.53%, as is authorized without a majority vote of the property owners. Request that council adopt the resolution approving the engineer's report, confirming the diagram and assessment, and ordering the levy of assessments for the Marina Cove maintenance assessment districts.My report is complete and I'm available for any questions.Any questions?Member Ashcraft to I just look like I have a question in the areas. So I thank you again, Mr. Corey. One of the things I noted that I think is a positive in this one is that in this year there is no allocation from fund reserves to cover expenses above the current year budget.And then in coming years, because with Marina Cove phase two coming online, that will bring in additional assessments. So there is potential for additional reserve collection or reduced assessments, right?Correct. The Marina Cove two communities facilities district does cover park maintenance with this assessment district. So there is potential for the assessment to decrease or a further allocation to reserves.Okay.And just for context, this Marina Cove development is right across Stratus, right across the street from where we just did the groundbreaking recently for the new fire station in emergency operations center. Right.Right. Right.Do we have speakers on this one? I don't know if.Any other comments. We have a motion.I'll move approval of this resolution, approving the engineer's report and confirming diagram and assessment in ordering levee of assessments.

Where are we? 13. Mr. Ross.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. As you know, many, many of our residents throughout the city of Long Beach and throughout the state are now hit with the influenza virus. I understand that this is one of the more severe strains and many people are being adversely impacted.I wanted to bring this forward, along with Councilmember Neal, to have the health department discuss the public severity of this year's flu season, the importance of getting vaccinated, and to provide us any city resources available to to residents to stay healthy.I'd like to turn this over to staff.Thank you, Councilmember. We'll have a report from our director of Health Services, Kelly Collopy, as well as our health officer, Dr. Mitchell Kershner.Good evening, Vice Mayor and members of the city council. As you probably heard, it's a big flu season and so it's not too late to get your. It's not too late to get your shot. We've had five, five fatalities in our city.And from from influenza, it's been hitting a much younger population than we've seen in the past. It's not just in older people's. It's not just hitting older people. We're finding it. You know, the median age is in the thirties.Those that are really being hit hard tend to have more underlying conditions diabetes, obesity, those kinds of things. They're showing up in our emergency rooms as the health department, we received 8000 doses from Los Angeles County of the vaccine.Of those, we distributed about 5000 to our community partners, which are nonprofits. They include organizations such as the Children's Clinic, St Mary's Mobile Clinic. And so they they provide that. They provide the shots and then they report back to us and how those shots are used.In terms of then, you know, what's available.Moving.Forward. The county or sorry, the city is providing free clinics. We are providing a free clinic this Thursday morning at the health building at 25, 25 grand. We'll be providing another free clinic Friday.Afternoon at the health building.And then on Saturday, between ten and two at Houghton Park, in conjunction with a. Affordable Care Act registration opportunity. So there are free opportunities out there. We have given over 2000 free immunizations so far. A thousand or so at the Health Department and another 1000 at other events out in the community.So we're doing our very best to bring to bring access. I do want to turn over the the time to Dr. Kushner as he's got a little bit more.About.The effectiveness of the vaccination and why it's important to get it. Thank you.Thank you, Mayor. City Council. As our director mentioned, there's been five confirmed deaths so far. And to put this in perspective, in the our influenza activity is widespread throughout California, throughout the whole state. There have been over 200 confirmed deaths of influenza in California at this point currently.Almost all the all the deaths and most of the confirmed cases of influenza have been influenza type A H1N1. This is the type A influenza that first hit the scene in 2009, 2010. The city of Long Beach had no fatalities from influenza over the last two years.Back in that season, we had a total of eight fatalities. So having five already at this point sort of points to the seriousness of the widespread activity. There are currently five ICU hospitalizations currently in our Long Beach hospitals.The H1N1 strain is included in this year's vaccine. We have started vaccinating since October of this year. We there is still plenty of flu in the state and in our city. The health department continues to offer flu vaccine.And basically, I'm urging residents that it is not too late to continue to receive the flu vaccine and to be protected. I will also say out of the five fatalities, all even though it's a younger age, as was the case in 2009, 2010, all the fatalities included younger people, but they all had underlying conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, etc.. Okay. Thank you.Thank you very much. And I just had a quick question, Mr. Vice Mayor, if I may. The community free clinics. Yeah. Will we be providing Felipe Reef flu shots at those clinics?Yes. Yes. The extra additional clinics that we've added at the Health Department and in Highland Park will be free and open to everyone. Yes.Okay. Thank you very much.Okay. Any public comment on the item? Saying None up. Yes, go ahead, sir.Aaron. Aaron Day. Now, when I was 35 years old, and that was while I'm 74 now, I was living in Los Angeles and they had the the flu. Well, they actually had the flu going around. And I caught it.And that was the London flu. And as it turned out, you see, I didn't I didn't watch myself. And so as it turned out, 35 years of age, when I caught it, I almost died. And there was a young man across the street from me.He was 29 years old and he did pass away. Now, when I talked to a lot of people, now what I hear, hear them say is, oh, when I take that flu shot, oh, I get the you know, the reactions and all that.And so many people don't want to take that flu shot. And I know this year last year in October, when I got my flu shot, I was really feeling good that day because I felt really great. But later on that evening, I had measles and I felt really bad.So I ended up going home and slept and I slept the rest of the evening. I got up and had dinner, but then went back to bed. But I don't know. One of my brothers also, he doesn't want to take the flu shot because he still has that reaction.So I think that has to be emphasized also that, you know, some people will get that reaction. And so it's those people who don't want to take their flu shot. So that's what this economy.Thank you, sir. Councilman Austin Jordan, back in motion.Yes. I'd like to move the receiving file this report.There's been a motion in a second. No other public comment or the council comment. Please cast your votes. I mean, yes.Motion carries five votes.

The Chair recognizes Councilor Edwards, chair of the Government Ops Committee.Tickets are consistent with several of the rockets we have done before and with police officers who as a result of an injury, have been decommissioned or unable to perform their duties. They were sponsored by Councilor Sobhy George and similar to the deep conversations that we had before when it came to the other dockets we went through andmade sure that they were consistent in language. We removed things like Sirius and really made sure we were talking about firearm injury. We wanted to make sure that while that they could have additional income and we increased that income to $100,000 versus capping it at $15,000, I was one of the biggest concerns and also made sure thatthe there were certain outdated language that if a spouse got remarried somehow, some way, she should lose her benefit. That has been removed as well. So we made this consistent after a deep back and forth with the retirement commission and with other law enforcement individuals from prior hearings.So based on what we did before, this is consistent with that. I wanted to acknowledge also the service of these individuals. I know two of them were shot in East Boston. And so I did want to acknowledge that, um, that trauma.And how what they must have gone through in their families as well. And I would be remiss without acknowledging the leadership and the definitely the coming through of of council clarity on so many of these dockets as of late and as well as Christine O'Donnell for her shepherding so much of this as well.Thank you, Christine. So I want to now turn it a with your permission to Councilor Sabi George, who is the lead sponsor of the three dockets.Thank you so much. The chair recognizes Councilor Sabi George. Councilor Sabi. George, you have the floor.Thank you very much, Madam President. And thank you to the chair and to the Vice Chair for their work to ensure that this could be before this body today. I do want to echo Councilor Edwards. Thanks for Matthew Morris, Richard Santillo and Scottie O'Brien for their service to our city.And through this ordinance, through this work, I believe we will make these officers and recognize their service, will make them whole and recognize very formally their service to our city. They all three have sustained tremendous and significant physical injuries as well as will have forever some emotional scars that will remain with them forever.So just grateful for their service to our city and look forward to an urge, passage and acceptance of these three dockets. Thank you, Madam President.Thank you so much, Madam Clerk. We're going to take these dockets separately in terms of our votes, beginning with Docket 1219. Oh, sorry. The chair recognizes Councilor Raul Castro. You have the floor.So I wanted to start by thanking these officers for their service and also pre facing this by saying that I'm going to vote for this. I continue. And the reason I am going to vote for this is because we've created a standard now.And the previous the previous three, I think it was that we did this, we created this new sort of standard and formula. And so I'm going to vote for this because it's now part of what we already do as a set standard.I will just continue to uplift that. My concern with it is not the service of these gentleman or their injuries. As somebody whose grandfather was injured on the job as a police officer and had disabilities, I do have concerns about the council having different sets of standards for different for how you receive your injury rather than whatthe injury you have is. I do believe that, frankly, and thank God most of our officers did not receive their injuries through shootings. They receive their injuries in other ways. And I don't want to create a system where we are prioritizing how you received your injury rather than the severity of your injury, even if they are thesame injuries. And so I know that we have a new standard that I will down vote to approve this under that, because that's been set up. But I do want to just voice that concern because I don't want officers or firefighters or other folks coming in with the same injuries in a different way that they've received themand receiving different treatment or different standards. And so I would like us to have some thought about in the future how we make this a uniform process for all. And that is all. And again, thank you for their service.They all were injured in really heroic ways, frankly. And so I will be voting for this today. Thank you.Thank you, Councilor Arroyo.

The committee recommends the bill pass.Thank you, Madam Clerk. Councilmember Lewis, it's all you.Thank you so much, Madam President. Hopefully, this can be a comparatively brief agenda item. Council Bill 120264 is aptly described by the title of the legislation. We heard a great presentation in committee last week from the Parks Department on the need to have a clearer regime to define what commercial activity might be in a park, and tohave some kind of system to regulate the extent to which there can be allowed commercial activity, both in terms of the time and the space that that takes up in a public park going forward. So for the first time, this legislation creates a definition of what is considered commercial activity.To give a couple of examples of the kinds of activity parks has in mind that they would like to be able to facilitate with some level of consideration. And to do only permit would be something like an exercise class or a yoga class or some kind of mild food concession that might be seasonal.So some examples that were given were the food truck pilot for permitting in Westlake Park, which has been a fairly common occurrence over the last couple of years in the downtown core and potentially having services similar to that on a seasonal basis and some other parks around the city.This legislation was passed unanimously out of committee with five councilmembers voting in favor and nine opposed. And I am happy to move the legislation.Is there a second, second rate? Are there any other comments regarding Councilmember Lewis's legislation? Not seeing or hearing none. Will the clerk please call the role on the passage of the bill?Want? Yes. Strauss. Yes.LEWIS Yes.Morales Yes. MACHEDA All right. Nelson, I. Peterson.I.Council President Juarez. I Ididn't favor none of those.Thank you. Before we move on to a chairman and other businesses, I have a few comments I want to make that I had been hoping that I would not have to make at this point, but apparently it looks like I.Moving forward as a point of order, this council president will have an exercise and hopefully you will all recognize my quote unquote, my virtual gavel that it will mute us. I am going to rely on our colleagues to abide by all rules, hold us accountable to rules, behavior, and courtesy of decorum, civility and basic kindness.The members are reminded that it is never in order to make personal remarks or attacks. The members are reminded that colleagues will not attack or question the integrity or motives of other colleagues. And the members are reminded that we will not be discourteous to each other or make personal and insulting remarks.I'm hoping that going forward as council president, that we instill a safe place, a kind place, so the rest of the city can see that we are a functioning council. They can agree to, agree to disagree and still move forward for this great city.Again, I will use the point of order and I will mute us if indeed this Council President feels that we are not following those basic rules of decency and debate to our colleagues. So with that colleagues, this concludes our items of business today.Our next regularly scheduled city council meeting is on February 15th two, and I hope you all have a great afternoon. Thank you, Madam President. Yes.Sorry. I did have a good of the order item. I apologize. But just briefly, I would like to ask to be excused from the March 20 seconds and 29 Council meetings.Tuesday to Thursday Senate March due to Tuesdays to Tuesdays. Okay. Well, let's do this then.

He was born somewhere else but came in when he was one year old and has lived in the city and county since.And now he's going to move to Chicago.So the shame of it all. Well.It has been such a.Pleasure for me to know, James and to work with James.He is wonderful to ask questions to.He get I give immediate responses.He explains things to me which is really important and helpful. And he's just acted as an incredible.Leader to this city, and especially when he's dealing with.Money, things and purchasing. And so I know that we will miss him, but.I wish him well in his next step in life.Thank you, Councilwoman Lehman. Councilman Lopez.Thank you, Madam President. Jim is really, really sad to see you go to Chicago, right? When we traded Jay Cutler over there, you get to go watch him instead of Peyton Manning. And I think we're going to lose somebody great to a great city and we're going to lose somebody from our great city.But I know that whatever you do out there, you're going to really make an impact. And I got to work with you a few times. And you've always been a very classy person. Very. Person, very diligent, very thoughtful and knowing that you're from Denver.I know why you're right. And so there's there's something to be said about people who choose to serve the public in our city and that they're Denver residents. It makes it ten times better because you go back and go to sleep in the same city that you had to you serve.So thank you. Congratulations.Thank you. Councilman Lopez, Councilman Nevett.Thank you, Madam President. It may have brought Councilwoman Layman pleasure to read this proclamation, but it didn't bring me any pleasure at all to hear it. I think it's outrageous that Jim McIntyre is retiring that completely. Well, okay, you're retiring.Well, I'll live with it. I got to say, Jim McIntyre has been a pillar of integrity and rigor in the purchasing department, and that has stood the city and county in very good stead, because the the the purchasing process, particularly for big high dollar contracts, can be very fraught.People get very excited about it. A lot of money is at stake. And the process, the processes that Jim McIntyre has put together have withstood all the slings and arrows that could be thrown at it from all of the disgruntled bidders, and they've always stood up.So Jim McIntyre's work has saved us all a lot of pain and heartache, but I am still sorry to see you go. Chicago. Who comes up with this stuff? But yeah, I guess. But, you know, Jay Cutler is a crybaby.And Jim back there. I know crybaby. The guy, they got good sausage. Anyway, thank you, Madam President. Jim, sorry to see you go, but thank you for all the great work you've done for the city. It's been a real pleasure working with you.Thank you. Councilman Leavitt, Councilwoman Fox.Thank you, Madam President. I think the Chicago angle has has surprised a lot of us. I'm from Illinois to here, and I really do. I really recommend the go west young man approach works out a lot better in the long run.You really have been helpful and help in analyzing the contracts, and I appreciate the way you've helped me think through some of the concerns I have had when they arise. So thank you, Jim. You've made a true impact and I will miss you.But now I have to question all this.Chicago.Oh, thank you, Councilwoman Fox, Councilwoman Robb.Well, I guess it could be worse, Jim. You could be moving to Seattle and then we'd really resent it. I think you were one of the first people I worked with in the city and county of Denver on process.I knew very little bit very little about the city's RFP process and even less about purchasing. And I don't know if I should even mention what we were working on. But just for those of you are curious. Parking kiosk at the time.So that's probably information that you'll never have to use again. I congratulate you on your retirement.Thank you, Councilwoman Robb.Councilman Lopez.All this talk about Chicago and losing you to Chicago, I think I figured something out. We should figure out who was doing the exit interview and in the contract. Jim must send us pizza from Gino's East on Superior.You send us that, we'll write you a great letter of reference. Oh, right.Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. All right. I think we are ready for the vote.Liman. Lopez All right. Monteiro Nevitt. Ortega. Hi, Rob Shepherd. Brooks. I thought I heard in college, I. Lopez. Hi, Madam President.I found a secretary close to voting nounced the results. 1212 eyes. The proclamation is adopted. Councilwoman Lehman, would you like to call somebody up to the podium?I think I'd love to hear from Jim Mack.I think that would be an excellent idea. Mr. McIntyre? Oh, he's got a he's got an agent coming by.Good evening. My name is Adrian Benevides, and I am the executive director of the Department of General Services. And if I may speak for a couple of minutes before Jim comes up and and talks to you.You know, this is one of those things that it's.Wonderful for Jim and his family who are here with him tonight. And I'm sure he will.Introduce everybody to you. But it's also bittersweet.For us.Because we are losing a strong leader in our department and for the city.You know, I met Jim nearly three years ago when I came to the city and we hit it off right away. And I thought, you know, I'm not going to come here and talk to you about all of the great things he's done in purchasing and and read statistics to you.But I will mention that he and I had very similar procurement philosophies. He really had an emphasis, as do I, on doing things better, not just being happy with the status quo, but looking at how we can do this better, how we can serve our customer better.He has done several things with changing the process as you guys are aware of couple of ordinances on changing the processes. Just this past year, he did a reorganization within his division that provided much better opportunities for his staff.And as you all also know, the city has been very devoid of any procurement scandals. And that really speaks to Jim's leadership and his emphasis on ethical behavior at excuse me, and the training.That he provides to his staff. One of the things he also did.That I strongly embrace was his emphasis on his staff. If you look.At and I'm sure you guys have worked.With many of our buyers, you see a lot of them are my children's age because he does something different than other procurement directors. He invests in people. He brings them in and he teaches.Them.How to be procurement professionals. And.You know, he doesn't do it just from the philosophy that we can develop these young people and we can provide a career for them. But he looks at it.As How can we learn from them with the expertize, particularly with social media.And computers.And everything else? And just a fresh perspective at procurement has made a huge difference in our department, and it comes from.Jim and his investment in his staff. He also has.A huge concentration on vendors. He meets with vendors all the time where he will explain our processes, explain how they can take advantage of opportunities within our city. As you know, we initiated a major Mwb program for goods and services this past April.But even prior to that.I can tell you from the last couple of years, he has made that a major emphasis working on contracts to have minority and women's participate in minority and women owned businesses, participate in city contract opportunities.So he has.Done that and with this new program, we'll be able to even do more. He has also added immensely to our department's leadership. He works very well with all of our with his peers, our other division leaders, has been supportive of them and teaching them and helping work through processes with them and actually makes for some fun meetingsthat we have at our staff meetings. One of the other things that he does, which really endeared him to me, is that some of the things that are very important to me are.Also.Extremely important to him. One of those that he.Places high priority on.Is his family. Like I said, they're here tonight. But I know you made some comments about Chicago, and I'll let him explain that to you. But that was a sacrifice he made for his family in going to Chicago.One of the other things he does is, you know, he wears his culture on his sleeve. You won't know how much we talk about Irish culture and the importance that it has to him. And that's important to me because my culture is also important as well as traditions.And of course, there's something I don't know a lot about, but I've learned a lot, which is also important. And that's golf, you know, and.He can talk your ear off about that.But finally, the way this came forward with that was not anything I did. But it was his. Staff. His staff that put this together and the proclamation and many of them are here tonight, and I wanted them to stand so you can recognize how endeared he has become to all of them.So if his staff members could stand. Hey. So with that, I will just say that he will be very missed by our department.But by the city as well.Thank you, Mr. Benevides. Mr. McIntyre.Madam President, members of City Council, thank you so much for taking time out of your busy schedule and your work to do tonight. I'll try to make this brief. I do have my family here. I'd like to introduce my lovely wife, Tammy, who's not only beautiful, but she's also very talented and has a great opportunity in Chicago. So I'm following the money. And my daughter Amanda, my son Matt and my new son in law, Brandon Eriksen, they're getting married in December. Thanks for being here, guys. I really appreciate you coming. I was going to say that Denver's just too tame.I want to go to Chicago.Mix it up, you know, in the mix.But really, it's it's a great opportunity for my wife and I. We're very excited about the move, you know, to this body. I want to thank you and and the administration take the time to do that. I've always had a lot of freedom in managing this department of always feel, you know, unhindered and and and interfered withand as counsel, Nevitt said some of these situations, they do get very emotional and they do get touchy. And it's a testament to this organization and how, you know, quality the people of this council are and the administration is to let our processes work.Key things like vendor selection in the right perspective. And it's made my job very easy. So thank you to that for all your support over the years. To my colleagues around the city, you know, at this point of your career, it really gets down to relationships and the friendships and the mentors I've had.The people that have allowed me to mentor them means so much to me. It's been very gratifying and it's meant a lot to me in my career, to my staff. I think you all know that for me, it's it's hard to find John McIntyre, the guy, and Jimmy Carter, the purchasing director.You know, it is kind of who I am. And you folks are such a big part in my life. We spend a lot of time together every day. I absolutely love this department. And that's of course not because of what we do, but because of what we've meant to each other and what we've built together.Thank you so much for your support. To me, your friendship to me. I really am going to miss you all terribly. And you know, this job changed my life. And there's a lot of people like me who come here with this lofty goal of, I just want to pay my bills.That's how lofty my goals were when I started here 23 years ago. And it gave me a career. It allowed me to to raise my kids in a way I really never dreamed possible and send them off to school and watch them grow into the fine adults they've had here.So, I mean, that's such a testament, right, to be able to work somewhere in a place, an environment and a culture that changed your life. And that's what this organization did for me. Thank you so much, everybody. I'm going to miss you all.Thank you, Mr.. I have another proclamation. This one is going to be read by Councilwoman Robb.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThank you. Thank you. Communications. Madam Secretary, do we have any communications.Then, Mr. President?Proclamations. We have three proclamations this evening. Councilman Castro, will you please read Proclamation 804?Thank you, Mr. President. I would be honored to as proclamation number 16 dash 0804 in recognition of Paul, a Heineman executive director of Urban Drainage in flood control district upon his retirement. Whereas Paul Heineman holds a Bachelor of Science degree in agricultural engineering from Colorado State University and a master's degree in business management from the University ofColorado at Denver. As a professional engineer licensed in the state of Colorado, he has over 37 years of experience in the field of water resources, both in the private and public sector. And. WHEREAS, Mr. Heineman began his esteemed career with the Urban Drainage and Flood Control District on January seven, 1985, as a project engineer for the maintenanceprogram. He has held a variety of positions rising through the ranks to become executive director of the district in 2008 and has decided to retire effective September 16, 2016. And. Whereas, in over his 31 years with the district, he served with dedication and his legacy will forever be remembered through the numerous projects that were completed during histime with the district, which include the Goldsmith Gulch, the Storm Sewer Pipe Material, Technical Memorandum, Lakewood Gulch and the University Mexico Storm Sewer, and where, as Mr. Heineman said, unwavering commitment to the district and the safety of every Colorado resident was witnessed firsthand in September 2013, when many counties in the metro area suffered historic flooding.These same floods also displayed the great work that has been done in Mr. Heineman this time, much of which goes underappreciated until it is needed. And. Whereas, through his leadership, responsiveness to citizens and elected officials, volunteer work within the community and dedication to improving policies, procedures and best practices for flood mitigation.Mr. Heineman has helped strengthen a culture and infrastructure that will continue to protect residents and property for decades to come. Now, therefore, let it be proclaimed by the Council of the City and County of Denver, Section one, that the Council of the City and County of Denver honors the work of Paul Heineman and expresses its sincere appreciationfor his outstanding career of service to the people of the city and county of Denver, the seven counties served by the Urban Drainage and Flood Control District and the state of Colorado. Section two. That the clerk of the city and county of Denver shall attest and affixed the seal of the city and county of Denver to thisproclamation, and that a copy be transmitted to Mr. Paul Heineman and the Urban Drainage and flood control district.Thank you. Councilman, your motion to adopt.Yes, thank you, Mr. President. And I move that proclamation. 804 be adopted.It has been moved. Let's see here. It's been moved and we get a second.I'm trying.You can see it. We got Ortega for a second. Comments by members of Council. Councilman Cashman.Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, I do want to again mention I want to thank Councilman Lopez for actually bringing this forward. And I'm sorry he's unable to attend and wish his family well. And I know he would be expressing his admiration for Mr. Hyman's work.And Councilman Lopez served as chairman of the Urban Drainage Board for a while and is a fan. I know that for sure. So for those who don't know the urban drainage and flood control district, one of the least cool names for an organization I think I've ever heard was formed in 1969 to work on essential drainage andflood control projects along the front range. The area urban drainage looks at is over 1600 square miles. Includes the city and county of Denver, the six counties that surround us. Parts of it I think 33 cities and towns and affects 2.8 million people.So when I first started on council over a year ago and then President Herndon made the appointments to various boards, I got word that I had been appointed to the board of the Urban Drainage and Flood Control District, an organization that I knew nothing about.And I thought Urban drainage. What is this going to be about? And I was very unimpressed. And then I started talking with friends who have interest in that area. And universally the word came back that this was an organization, the Urban Drainage and Flood Control District, that was held in the highest esteem for the work that itdoes and the importance of the projects that it does in saving lives. And then as I got began serving on the board and got to know more intimately about the work the board did, it is a totally nonpolitical organization.It is one of the most efficient deliverers of service that I think I've seen in my time on council. They they look to the jurisdictions that they serve to tell them what needs to be done. And then they design and engineer the projects and go to outside sources to actually do do the construction.The work they do has literally saved lives throughout throughout our area. And as was mentioned in the proclamation, all you need to do is to look back at the flood was 1965. I think that the Platte River flooded.And you look at Boulder, the Boulder area a couple of years ago and this is serious business. And we've talked a lot about our drainage needs in this city recently. And I need to say this and this is a difficult thing to say.So I had we had a vote on a drainage issue recently, and I personally have come to have the utmost respect for Mr. Heineman in serving on the board and watching him carry himself. He is deadly serious about the work that his organization does and feels a commitment to the communities that he serves.And we ended up on opposite sides of an issue. And I had to vote in a way that Mr. Heineman was not pleased with and would have recommended against. And I was so happy that that meeting for that vote ran till about two in the morning, because I noticed about midnight that before we took our vote thatthat that Mr. Heineman had to leave the building. And so when it came time for me to place my vote, I didn't have to look him in the eyes. So. You know, that's the way this job goes sometimes.And it was no reflection on my opinion of my friend. So with that, I would just offer my congratulations on a wonderful career. And those are going to be very big shoes to fill. And thanks and enjoy your time with your grandkids.Thank you. Councilman Cashman, Councilman Gilmore.Thank you, President Brooks. You know, Paul, it's been an honor getting to know you. I kind of got to know a little bit about your work even before I was elected, because I was always kind of researching what we could do about the Montebello channels.And so, you know, your steady leadership and your commitment to protecting lives and property always with not enough money to really do all of these projects. And so being creative and thinking outside the box and going for different grant dollars is so important.And, you know, you're not just going to leave a, you know, small hole in this organization. I mean, for a lot of intents and purposes, you are this organization. And so I know that transference of leadership is something that you've been working really hard on, and we're going to be proud of the next leader.But no, that will be missing you and hopefully living vicariously through your adventures and your grandchildren and all of the different things I hope you get to do. So thank you for your service. Paul. Thank you.President Brooks Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman.Thank you, Mr. President. I'm so happy to be a part of this proclamation for you. I sort of felt the same way when I was assigned to urban drainage about five years ago and but came to also discover how much I didn't know about urban drainage and how much I would like to know about urban drainage.And one of the most special things that you did for us, Paul, was the lectures before the meeting began. He would give us classes in hydrology 101 before the meeting while we were eating a delicious lunch. By the way, I always would like to recommend that to all of the professors I had before.And so I got to learn all these cool words like outfall and drop structure and occlude and capillary. Not not to be confused with hilarity. And my favorites were Cone of Depression and Cone of Influence, which I often feel like describes the work of a councilwoman.But it has to do with water. And I have always been so grateful to have learned as much as I did about urban drainage. And that doesn't sound very sexy, but it's so important to our community. And the work that you done with urban drainage is something that you are going to.They are big shoes to fill and thank you very much for a wonderful experience serving on your board.Great Councilwoman and Councilman Clark. I apologize. I'm sorry.Thank you, Mr. President. Well, unlike some of my colleagues, I was very well aware of who the urban drainage and flood control district was before I got here, because I'd spent 17 years of my life working down on the South Platte River, and this is just a one of a kind organization and under your leadership has reallydone amazing things. So you will be sorely missed. You know, one of the things that when you when you play and you work down by the South Platte River, there are a lot of organizations who have some touch on that and have some authority and some control.And that is a hardworking river. And it serves a lot of different things. And one of the frustrations for me was always as I was trying to work on making the river fun and engaging and safe place for kids to come and learn was to run into these big organizations with a lot of resources who would say, Well, that's not the primary function of this river. This is that this river's primary function is to convey water, to get water from point A to point B or to do this or to do that. And one of the things that was just amazing to run into urban drainage and flood control was that you guys totally gotit. Was that yeah, that wasn't your primary objective. And you're here to keep keep the city safe and to convey that water in a storm event. But you absolutely understood, like I would say, no other organization working down there that is governmental, that that didn't have to be exclusive, that it didn't just have to be that that'sthe one thing this river is going to do. And so anybody who has been down to the South Platte River and seen the $30 million worth of new improvements that have happened in the last 4 to 5 years under your leadership, none of those projects were possible without.You. And without you guys, they just weren't. And you were. You just had this amazing ability to always come to a project and say, hey, this is what we have to get done. But you know what? We can do it like this.And then look at all the benefits. Look at. Look at what can happen. And look at now. Today, all of the kids who are down there and experiencing the river and all the wildlife opportunities, that is possible because of urban drainage and because of your leadership.And so as a city, we are in your debt and you will be sorely missed. And and I would say that the river has no greater friend than you. So thank you for everything they've done. Thank you for your commitment and your work and enjoy what you're doing next.But I hope you'll continue to be a friend of the river in Denver, even in retirement. Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Ortega.Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like first to ask that my name be added to the proclamation. And then I want to also thank Paul for his years of service with urban drainage and all the important work that you've done throughout the city of Denver and neighboring jurisdictions.I had the benefit of serving on urban drainage for some time and worked with your predecessor, Scott, and your former colleague Bill DeGroot on a number of projects, some of which are on the South Platte River. But that important work would not happen without the important role of urban drainage.I wish you guys would have been the lead agency on the project that Councilman Cashman talked about just a few minutes ago. It might have been a different project, but, you know, that's water under the bridge, I guess, at this point.But I just wish you well in your retirement. And as someone said earlier, there will be some big shoes to fill and just thank you for your service. I see that some of your colleagues are here and hope that when you get a chance to speak, maybe you can just acknowledge them as well.Thanks.Thank you. Madam Secretary, roll call.Cashman I 20 start sorry. Cashman can each. I knew Ortega I Sussman.I Black.High Clark Espinosa. Flynn I Gilmore I Herndon High. Mr. President.I close voting. Announce the results just.Sorry. One moment. Yeah.Total Vice 12 Eyes Proclamation 804 Passes. Now, Councilwoman Kathryn, do you have anyone that you'd like to bring up?I like to think about it as a little room full of people. I'd like to invite Mr. Heineman to say a few words.Thank you very much. First of all, I'm glad that motion passed. And I don't want any of you to confuse me. I'm Paul, and there's a Paul, and we both have blue striped shirts on. But I work for urban drainage.And you're with Denver. You know, I've been at urban drainage and flood control district for over 30 years. And as all of you said, it is a great organization and I have just been blessed to have been a part of that and to work with the city and county of Denver on, as you've all said, numerous projectsto help the citizens of Denver be protected when when a flood does happen to protect people, property and the environment. I've had the pleasure to serve with in the last eight years as executive director with four of you on my board.Councilman Cashman, Councilwoman Gilmore and Councilman Lopez, who are on the board right now, and Councilwoman Sussman, who was and Councilwoman Ortega, I do remember back when I was working in the Design Construction Maintenance Program that you were on our board as well and and did many projects in Denver.And our partnership with Denver through the years is just been amazing. We we always want it wanted to serve and do what city and county of Denver wanted us to do, not what we wanted or thought or directed to do.And that has turned out some fabulous projects on Lakewood Gulch, where Gulch, West, Harvard, South Platte, River, Cherry Creek. And I think in the proclamation of one of the ones Councilman Cashman mentioned was Goldsmith Gulch. And I was the project manager on that.And any of you who have been with city and county Denver for a while know that was a long, tedious process to get that done. But we did. And more than 150 households are now protected and are not in a hundred year flood plain because of that project.And that is probably the one in my career that I am the most proud of because that's what this is all about, is to protect people. And I again am just so grateful to have been a part of that.And I am humbled by the people that I've worked with, both with Denver and and at my organization. So thank you very much for this. This is this is the high this is the highlight of my career. Thank you very much.\nReasoning:",

Next up, we have proclamations.We do have one proclamation this evening. Councilwoman Black, will you please read Proclamation 1383?Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. Proclamation number 18 1383, recognizing the 30th anniversary year of the Metropolitan Denver Scientific and Cultural Facilities District. Whereas, arts, culture and science play a unique role in the lives of our families, our communities, our state in our country, and enrich our lives by embodying the accumulated wisdom, intellect, knowledge and imagination of humankind. And. Whereas, in 1988, voters in Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Denver, Douglas and Jefferson Counties voted to create the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District, a special district collecting a 1/10 of 1% sales and use tax for distribution to arts, culture and science organization.And. Whereas, CFT was reauthorized in 1994, 24 and 2016 by the voters across seven counties, including Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas and Jefferson Counties, securing a place for art, biology, music, zoology, dance, history, nature and botany in the fabric of our lives, ensuring nothing less than culture for all.And. Whereas, in the 30 years of CFD existence, the landscape of arts, culture and science in the metropolitan region has expanded greatly, with nearly 300 organizations spend IT funding from distributed distributed funds in 2017. And. WHEREAS, organizations benefiting from funds from CFD create an unparalleled level of access for Colorado residents, offering thousands of free and discounted activitieseach year. And. Whereas, nonprofit arts, culture and science organizations drive the Colorado economy by generating $1.9 billion in total economic activity and supporting 11,820 jobs in 2017. And. Whereas, CFD continues to thrive as a national model for cultural funding now, therefore, be it proclaimed by the Council of the City and County of Denver's Section one that theCouncil of the City and County of Denver State of Colorado does hereby proclaim 2018 as the 30th anniversary of CFD. Section two that the Clerk of the city and county of Denver shall affix the seal of the city and county of Denver to this proclamation, and that a copy be transmitted to the scientific and cultural facilities.District Executive Director Deborah Jordi.Thank you, Councilman Black. Your motion to.Adopt.Thank you, Mr. President. I move the proclamation 18 dash 1383 be adopted.It has been moved and seconded. Comments from members of Council. Councilman Black.Thank you, Mr. President. I'm honored to serve on the board of CFD. The 30th anniversary is quite a milestone. It collects close to $60 million a year for the metro region, for our arts, culture and science. Thousands of organizations have benefited, benefited in those 30 years.With that tax, we're able to have a world class arts and culture scene that you wouldn't have in other cities of our size. So it's been a great, great benefit to the city and county of Denver and all of the other counties surrounding us.Additionally, it was mentioned in the proclamation there are hundreds of free events and free days for all of the cultural organizations. And it's not just our big organizations, the art museum and the museum, nature and science and the performing arts complex.But it's also small arts organizations across all of those counties. So it's just an incredible benefit that we have living here in the metro region. And I think the voters of 1988 who voted for it and everyone who has reauthorized it since then.Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Ortega.Thank you, Mr. President. And Councilwoman Black, thank you for bringing this forward. This is. An incredible asset to our community. And I know cities across the country have tried to figure out how Denver and the metro area was able to accomplish this.You travel to other cities that may have a little bit arts and culture. I know Austin claims they have the biggest music scene, but our music scene is way bigger than Austin's. We just don't quite promote ourselves the way they do.Right. But, you know, it's not just music. It's our performing arts. It's our crafters. We have such a robust creative sector in this city and this metro area that we really have something to be proud of. And there are lots of people who work full time in this industry, but there are many who work part time anddo other jobs. And if we could continue to grow this industry, then we could have more people that would be able to do this full time as opposed to part time. But, you know, almost any night of the week, you can go and listen to live music at any number of venues.We have many street festivals where we have music and crafters. So I'm I'm really excited. And for those of you who are not aware, the National Restaurant Stock Show is looking at doing a public market that sort of takes a lot of the work that's already happening to that next level where we have a year round goto place, where we could have a lot of these different kinds of things happening on a regular basis. So great work for everybody who has been part of this. I know this was under mayor pinions days. I remember Susan Barton scout worked for him when this was brought forward.But it was a metro wide effort and continues to be. And it's not just venues in Denver that get to benefit from this. There are venues across the metro area. And so we're we're really a very blessed community to have these incredible assets, not just the physical structures, but the people who make all of this happen.So congratulations for 30 years of some incredible stuff happening in our metro area.Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. So, you know their comments. I'll just add a second to everything that was said. We are very lucky to have CFD and to have voters who are forward thinking enough to see what that could be.Awesome organization. And thank you, Councilman Black, for bringing this forward. Madam Secretary, Raquel.Black Eye.Brooks Espinosa, i Flynn I.Gilmore, i.Herndon, i.Cashman can each i.Lopez Hi.Ortega. Hi, Susman.Hi, Mr. President.I am. I'm secretary. Please close voting announced the results. 12 hours 12 hours proclamation 1383 has been adopted. Councilman Black, is there someone you'd like to bring up to accept?Yes, we have two people from CFD here today, Deborah, today, who is our executive director, along with our board chair, Rob Johnson. Rob, please come give Deborah some support. It's an incredible board and an incredible organization. And thank you both for working so hard.Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Black, President, members of council. We are truly happy to be here and really appreciate your ongoing support. You know, I remember the days when Susan Vargo, Gail was on council. It really working hard through to every council since.But what's unique is not only the the depth and breadth of what the organizations do, but the reach of collaboration. We have so much collaboration between Denver organizations in Boulder and Douglas County that come together just like we see in other parts of our community and the business sector and others.It's amazing to think that in 1989, the first year of distribution, there were 124 organizations. Today there are almost 300. At that time, the first year of distributing the funds, it was $14 million. And as Councilman Black said, we're on the road to $60 million.The National Endowment for the Arts total budget for the country is around 150 million for the entire country. Our distribution is in the seven county the size of Delaware and Rhode Island put together. So it's pretty remarkable. Remarkable.It's also what the organizations do to create wonder and joy for the children. When you think last year that 4.3 million children attended cultural performances or run outs at their school. So thank you for having us and supporting us.CFT.Thank you. Thank you very much. Was our only proclamation before we move on. Unfortunately, due to fire code and the signs on the back. We can't have anybody standing in that back aisle. That is the ingress egress. So I would ask if everybody can get real cozy and make room so that we can fit everybody in.\nReasoning:",

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nAny other questions for Coach Miller? Being none. We thank you very much. And we will take up the first of the two charter amendments that are on our agenda today. This is proposed ordinance 2020 206, which would amend the county charter to grant the Office of Law Enforcement Oversight subpoena powers.Nick Bowman will give a staff report on the proposal. Mr. Bowman, the one is yours. Good afternoon, council members. For the record, Nic Bowman, council central staff. The materials for this item begin on page 389 of your packet.Proposed Ordinance 2020 0206 would submit to the voters of Clayton County an amendment to the county charter to be placed on the next general election, which would add the authority to subpoena documents, witnesses and other relevant evidence. The list of charter powers granted to the Office of Law Enforcement Oversight.As the council is well aware, King County has worked for many years to improve oversight of the King County Sheriff's Office. In the interest of time, I won't go into the full background of those efforts, but I will say that they began in 2006 with the establishment of a blue ribbon panel on police oversight and the adoptionof Ordinance 15 611 Creating Aliyah. In November 2015, the voters of King County approved an amendment to the county charter that established OLEO as a charter mandated county office within the legislative branch. This amendment, now Section 265 of the King County Charter, increased oversight responsibilities for Oleo and requiring that those authorities be established by ordinance.And in April 2017, the Council adopted Ordinance 818 500, expanding all those authorities to include investigative authority with subpoena powers for the office, complaint and concern intake responsibilities, including the authority to review Ccso complaint intake classifications, authorization to review policies, procedures, training and operations and to make recommendations.Access to relevant information and crime scene authorities. Notification requirements regarding cases of Complaint Handling Processes and review of inquest findings. Proposed Ordinance 2020 0206, as I said, would submit to the voters an amendment of the King County Amendment to the King County Charter, which would add the authority to subpoena witnesses, documents and other evidence relating to itsinvestigations or review to the list of all your powers described in Section 265 of the County Charter. As stated earlier, Oleo has subpoena powers under King County Code 2.75.055. However, unlike its charter provision that can only be added or removed by a vote of the people lost, ravished by ordinance is transitory and can be changed by thecouncil adopting a new ordinance. If the subpoena power were added to the charter, it can only be removed by a vote of the people. According to Olio director Deborah Jacobs, without the ability to compel the sheriff's office personnel to be interviewed and to produce relevant records.OLEO has limited ability to complete, thorough and objective investigations. Now the authority to issue subpoenas is an established power within oversight agencies around the country and one granted to numerous county entities. A non-exhaustive list of oversight offices in other jurisdictions across the country where some form of subpoena powers can be found on page 391 of your packetand includes. Oakland, California. Washington, D.C.. Chicago, Illinois. Denver, Colorado. Indianapolis, Indiana. Detroit, Michigan. Los Angeles, California. New York City. Cambridge, Massachusetts and Rochester, New York. The table on page 392, your packet lists the county entities with the authority to issue subpoenas as well as any limitations to that authority.And some of these entities include the County Council, the Ombud office, the Office of Civil Rights, the auditor, the chief medical examiner. The Personnel Board and the hearing examiner. It should be noted that should the proposed ordinance be adopted and subsequently approved by the voters, the amendment passage alone may not be enough to effectuate the desired change, as the proposed amendment may affect the working conditions of cso's unionized workforce. The county would most likely need to engage in bargaining with the affected unions before Oleo could exercise the powers granted by that amendment. I also just want to touch briefly on some election timing requirements in order to place on the November three, 2020 ballot andeffective ordinance must be transmitted to Elections Department by August 4th, 2020. Therefore, the last regular council meeting date for adoption is July 21st and August 4th. 2020 is the last special council meeting date to adopt the ordinance as an emergency.Finally, there are two amendments. Amendment one would make changes to the language and substance of the proposed charter amendment, including changing the general election date in which the proposed charter minute would appear on the ballot from November 2019 to November 2020.Granting Oleo the authority to administer oaths to witnesses subpoenaed by Oleo and clarifying that any witness subpoenaed by Oleo shall have the right to be represented by legal counsel. Amendment One confirms the title of the proposed ordinance to the changes made by Amendment One.With regards to changing the general election date in which the proposed charter amendment would appear on the ballot from 2019 to 20 2nd November 2020. That concludes my staff report. We have also director for Jacobs and she's Patrick Singleton, CSO Online to help answer any questions the committee may have.Mr. Bowman For my clarity. Clarity? The two amendments are the one substantive amendment and the title amendment. Is that correct? That's correct. Thank you. And next, I'd like to call on our commissioner from the Charter Review Commission. I believe, as I'm prepared to present on this amendment.Alejandro. Pausing at 100 trees. There we go.Hi, everyone. One thing, Councilor McDermott, first of all, is that it says that my Internet is a bit unstable here in rural unincorporated, which I think all of us feel a little unstable during COVID. So let me know if I'm lagging.And I can try to adjust or shut off my video. I wanted to thank you, Councilmember German pair and all the council members for this discussion. I also want to express my gratefulness to the charter commission, some of whom are watching especially.At 100, you just walk up. Of 100 drives. I suggest you turn your video off.Okay. Will do. Is this any better? Yes. Okay. Excellent. So just wanted to say thanks again to the charter commission, especially the equity committee, especially my co-chair, Liz Ford, who was a main driver. I think Nick actually mentioned quite a number of things, so I don't know that I'm going to be doing a lot more of fleshingthat out. But I just want to say a little bit from the charter conditions perspective as to what we felt that this amendment would do and also why we felt it was necessary. As Nick mentioned, this also needs to have the authority to subpoena records and provide effective civilian oversight for law enforcement.And, of course, the amendment for subpoena power would add to that list of oleo of authority charters granted to oleo in the charter, and the county code already has a reflection and contemplates granting this authority to oleo. But it is not listed as in the charter as it is with other agencies.Now the CRC believes this amendment, if this amendment passes and ultimately can be bargained, that subpoenas rarely be used as parties will share information and not want to have to use the subpoena process. Well, with that in mind, why do we feel this is necessary?The Charter Commission believes that the residents can county have expected civilian oversight of the King County Sheriff's Office since 2006 and before, but at least 2006 when the council created the office, and certainly since 2015, when the voters added oleo to the county charter.However, efforts for effective civilian oversight, including subpoena power, have consistently been thwarted by the collective bargaining process. The issues to this day, the charter commission believes, continues to this day and we feel is a powerful statement to add the subpoena power to the charter and make it consistent with other agencies.It's been almost 14 years since the council first created Oleo, and that way it is long enough for effective civilian oversight. We feel by you moving this forward to the ballot, voter approval will help clarify the public's desire for more empowered oversight of our sheriff's office.Thank you.Thank you. Council members questions of Mr. Goldman Miss Trace and I'm Patty content. I'm sorry, Miss Court. And I don't know your current title, Undersheriff.In another week, I'll be the undersheriff. And currently you don't, chief, but okay.And also Director Jacobs are all available for questions as well. Colleagues. Ashton Lambert Councilmember, remember?LAMBERT Thank you. So I have two questions. One is, will this change the requirement for it to be parliament? And secondly, if you look at the chart, there are many departments that have the subpoena, including us. And to my knowledge, we have never used it.So how often in all of this has it ever been used? To my knowledge, it hasn't been. So I would like to be updated on that.I can speak generally to the first question, which is that it may require bargaining. It is our understanding that, yes, bargaining would need to take place before the olio to actually be able to subpoena you. So personnel that but that of course we would have to actually have the men would have to be adopted by the voters. So I don't want to put the cart before the horse too much.Right.And in addition, I do not have on hand a record of how many Times County entities have issued subpoenas. I would have to query all of those offices to determine that.It should be pretty easy because I think the answer is probably zero. I don't understand what is different. We already have the ability for them to subpoena. And as she said, it's been years that it hasn't been fired and for a variety of reasons that we probably should get to the bottom of.But this this doesn't change it. We'll be back exactly where we are right now in my mind. So that's a concern. We're making a pretty much false assumptions public that this will change the underlying.Richard Jacobs, did you have a response either to the previous question or the current one?Yes. Thank you. I appreciate you hearing from me a couple contextual comments. So the officers in the county that have subpoena power are counsel of Ombud, Office of Civil Rights Auditor, Chief Medical Examiner, Personnel Board and hearing examiner.And I also want to let folks know that it's a pretty much a norm for investigatory oversight agencies to have subpoena power. And I have a list of about 15 or 20 that I'm aware of that have it.In fact, almost none of them use it. And there's a good reason why. The reason is, is that once they have it, the threat of using it suffices to get the access to information that they need. That's been the lesson I have learned from hearing from my nationwide colleagues, is that once you have it, it sort ofworks without having to assert it. But Councilmember Lambert's comments are so well taken. The other thing I did want to mention is that there's specifically a real concern, the current collective bargaining agreement. It says that. That if the charter is amended, then it's a reopen after bargaining subpoena power as required by law.So that's one reason to do it now, because I know we have a lot of ambitions for the next round of bargaining. I also feel like having the voters affirm that this is their desire and make it consistent with the council's understanding of the role and the investigation role will be very important.And I think that affirmation would be meaningful and even potentially meaningful if there are challenges in the context of bargaining. So no, it's definitely does not overcome the state law challenges presented by collective bargaining for or oversight. But I still think it's important and worthy thing to be in the charter, to speak the will of the county. Thank you.Thank you. Further questions, colleagues. John. Councilmember Dunn. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Appreciate. And this is a question for our two questions. One is, does the sheriff's office have a position on this particular the charter amendment aside, appreciate your articulating it.And then the other question I have is, and maybe Debra countered, there are different kinds of subpoenas in the world. There are civil or criminal. There are legislative subpoenas. What is the what is the type of subpoena we are talking about here?And is there any standard that has to be met in order to request the subpoena? In other words, does it have to be within the scope of an active investigation, or can it be very broadly used in terms of various policy?What is what is the charter amendment speak to with specificity? Thank you.So I can keep cold Tindal sheriff's office, so I can answer Councilmember Dunn's question. So the position of the sheriff and our office is that we really are not taking a position on this. Obviously, this is something that has been an issue, if it goes to the voters, becomes part of the charter.It does have to be bargained. At least that's my perspective as your previous director of labor relations responsible for collective bargaining in the county, and that currently it is the executive who has that responsibility to negotiate this, which is really a working condition but because the voters previously.Basically approved that, you know, we would not bargain our own working conditions, which makes sense.Thank you. You're welcome. And on the second.So I don't have a full answer to your question. What I can tell you is the intent is that it would be able to have compel people, personnel to be interviewed about incidents and also to compel to get banking or phone records as far as the legal complexities of sort of how it would be administered.I don't have the familiarity and we'd have to have some research done on that. Can I just make one state? I'm sorry.Yeah, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead. I want to ask I think that like some other issues, I need some legal clarity on it. It may be just that it's substantially similar, as you said, are other independent counsel appointed positions.But I'd like to know and in particular, I'm interested in the in the contours or in other words, the limitations and what the subpoena power provide for my own information at some point. I mean, we're going to take action to travel with your passport.Helpful. So appreciate that. And go ahead.I just want to clarify one other thing about a reopen or that Deborah mentioned. That still has to be something that the guild would be interested in doing while it's in the contract. It still requires that there is the willingness to reopen.So I just wanted to point that out. Thank you. I mention one other thing, Councilmember. Councilmember Dunn, you know, the questions you're asking also would relate to what kind of independent investigations are being conducted. And this is something I'm really eager for a council to give some thought to and hopefully have a stakeholders conversation that includes guildmembers and KSO and the public. There are different ways it could be approached and I won't go into details now because I know we're short on time, but I think that there's a lot into sort of what this might look like.Yeah. And I appreciate that and I'll just finish with this. And so I'm not like, you guys aren't like searching in the dark. What I'm looking for is that the subpoena power is rationally related to the charter, the mission of Oleo in the charter, and other subsequent motions and legislation we put forward as well as staffing thatis that it if it goes forward, that it move in a way that is directly related to that mission as opposed to some, you know, blanket authority to subpoena whatever it is that is desire for the purpose of driving some policies or set of policies forward.That's a little bit different and it just needs to be discussed so we don't work or buy in here, so to speak. Up the road. Can about the growth. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I think I know the answer to this, but I want to make sure is the Sheriffs Guild contract next up for renewal at the endof next year. The crisis heads nodding. This charter amendment wouldn't take effect. The November ballot take effect, I assume, January one. And imagine that timing would be just about right to begin going into negotiations and. Right.So perfect timing.So that speaks to me as one reason to act. And I'd just one comment, if I may, if that's appropriate, Mr. Chair, then I. My constituents or people I hear from are often very confused about this process. And it's frustrating as an elected official because the heat is on us.I don't think most people realize that the only tools of civilian oversight that we're able to conduct over our sheriff's department or those in which the police agreed to. Because of this provision in state law that allows not only for the police guild to negotiate, but if we don't reach agreement, it goes to a third party andthat decision is final. And when that third party often looks at comparables, it means it's a barrier to change. And so this. Just to be clear about communicating what we're doing, we're. You know, this is being proposed to go in front of the voters, be put into our county constitution or county charter to strengthen our position there. Whether legally, politically, structurally. But at the end of the day, the only oversight we're allowed to provide is that in which the police agree to let us provide intel if and when state law were to change, and so not to get people's hopes up too much who are advocating for this?Because unless again, unless that state law changes, this is going to be. Only if the police want us to, basically. So that's my my comment on it. But I'm very supportive moving forward. Colleagues.Edification.Was my remember.So could you clarify? I think all of us had the right to do independent investigations. And I thought that there was a grievance at some point about that. Can you tell me where the grievance landed in and is there the right to do independent investigations?So I can say on the history that there was a grievance filed after the audience was initially passed in 2006. Most of that ordinance was repealed and then the grievance was dropped and the ordinance was passed in 2008 that aligned with the contract with guilds at the time, and then the powers were later established.I'll let Deborah speak it to the individual or the independent investigations, but that the initial grievance was for the initial ordinance, and then another ordinance was put in place.So I you're talking about the more current grievance. The grievance was over a systemic review of the shooting of my chance to get involved. And the guild has been on hold with its grievance because it wants to present it to Oehler in person and because of the virus that has not happened.310. I do not believe that report is an investigation is because no investigation was done, meaning no one was called. It was just the review of the file, much like, you know, of adding and then adding expertize. So if they don't like that, they're really not going to like what an investigation is.And that's something that, as I mentioned earlier, we really need to discuss, but that's a status after it's presented to all our rules. And then it's possible it could be appealed to arbitration. That would be the next step.I would love for us to be able to resolve it peacefully before that myself, and I've expressed that to Olara. So at this very moment, you have the right to do.Whatever.I'm sorry. The right to what? You independent investigations. So on a very limited scope, for example, it would be possible under limited circumstances to investigate someone who is not represented by the Guild. Yes. So basically, Deborah is correct.That would mean the chiefs, the undersheriff. Perhaps our legal advisers, those that are know, I think there's seven or eight of us that are not represented. A very limited. And beyond that, Patty, I believe the scope is also limited, meaning it might have to be a use of force or something like that as well.I'd have to look at the language, but I think it's along those lines.Thank you. Councilmember Dombrowski. Thank you, Mr. Chair. We've had some discussion about this. And I want to remind folks and please Deborah or Nick or legal counsel, correct me if I'm wrong, but Nick mentioned the 2017 implementing ordinance that I had worked on with councilmen, Councilmember Gossett, which carried that brought to life the the charter amendments passedby the voters. And we, I believe, already adopted in that ordinance the authority for the Office of Law Enforcement Oversight to issue subpoenas so that the the it's in their charge today. And I know that hasn't really been mentioned or has it's maybe got lost a little bit that this charter amendment would basically the thinking behind puttingin the charter is that it elevates the importance and to the extent we don't get agreement from the guild at the bargaining table coming up, the grove is 100% right. And I like the way you phrased it, that we can only do the oversight that the guild lets us do.But the thinking is that perhaps what the voters speaking on this particular topic, that it might, if necessary, to go to an arbitrator, have some extra strength in terms of the the people speaking so that the power is there by ordinance.This just puts it in the charter. We're not changing the contours of it at all in terms of the kind of subpoena power. And I think with respect to the individual investigations, the investigations of individuals, their use of force versus other investigations by the office, the subpoena power could be helpful in their systemic review as well tothe extent they need documents to complete that. And maybe that's my question to Director Jacobs. Would you agree with that?I would say at this point we are fairly successful in getting the documents we need from the sheriff's office. They have capacity problems, so there's a timeliness issue. But besides that, we have that kind of access. So it would be hard for me to envision that systemic review.I guess we would have to be trying to get data from like outside sources. It's possible, but I'll have to think a little bit more on that and I'll let you know.Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chair. You're welcome. Colleagues, anything else? Would you like a motion? I would welcome a motion. They, Mr. Chair, I'd be happy to move. Adoption of proposed ordinance number 2020 0206, which would with a do pass recommendation of the full council.The ordinance would put before the voters in the November 2020 election the question of whether they would like to amend King County Charter to specifically grant the Office of Law Enforcement Oversight, which was created by Charter. The power to issue subpoenas.And if amended here by Amendment one, to compel witnesses to testify with the assistance if they wish to counsel. Councilmember Dombrowski is moved to give a to pass recommendation to ordinance 2020 206. Councilmember Dombrowski if you want to move adoption of the amendment so moved to amendment one is before us.Staff addressed the amendment as the discussion on the amendment. All those in favor. Please say I i i opposed nay.A.The ayes have it. The amendment is adopted. Move t one and two. Two. One is before us discussion. All those in favor of Taiwan. Please signify by saying I oppose. Nay, the ayes have it. Total amendment is adopted.We have ordinance 2020 206 as amended before us discussion.Mr. Chairman, I'd like to speak.As a member of No Duty. Thank you.Thank you. It's been a while since somebody did that. I didn't speak up during the question and answer, but I wanted to just make my feelings on this clear is I have always believed as somebody who spent a lot of time working with internal investigations, people as labor advisers, legal adviser, as a director, I have always believedthat a good oversight, oversight that is accepted by all sides, by the public, by the people who have been harmed in most situations where we're doing an investigation and somebody has been harmed somehow and by the people who are providing critical services like law enforcement, feeling that they get a fair shake, I think that public oversight providesthat kind of assurance to everyone when it's done right. But in order for it to be done right, the investigators need access to the information they need to to do their job without full information. They cannot provide the transparency.That's what we seek with oversight. And so I think this is almost almost a no brainer. I don't have any concerns with this level of of of authority at all. I hope that we can implement it. I personally also believe that oversight should not be subject to bargaining.I should not be able to say whether somebody what somebody how somebody judges me. I should not control that process for myself. That's just that's almost unethical. And so I think it's really important that we move in this direction for everybody.By the way, I'm very much in favor of having a process that was briefed to us in that earlier briefing about how elected officials can be held accountable, not holding in on myself or my colleagues separate from this.So I just feel very strongly this is a good step. I will vote for it. I hope that it passes in November and that we can find a way to implement it. Thank you, Mr. Chair.Thank you. Other colleagues. Councilmember Dombrowski. I think it was I know the meeting's running long and I'll try to be very brief here, but I echo the comments, of course, from about 80. And I've been thinking a lot lately about the phrase law enforcement.And there's two pieces to that, the laws and the enforcement. And I think in the debate we're having here in our country right now, we should look at what laws we are passing and have passed and determine whether they are laws that have just put impacts in the way they come down on folks and make changes.We also need to look at our enforcement side and make sure that it's just and fair and effective and that people have confidence in it. This is one small piece of building confidence in the enforcement side of the laws that we as politicians and others have adopted.And like any profession, I just think that independent oversight, checks and balances, if you will, on that is par for the course. And it not only builds confidence by it in the system, by the public, or at least it can if it's done well, but it can also improve the organization.This is not about getting somebody or going after somebody. This is about ensuring that there is transparency when something goes wrong and that there is accountability and that there can also be vindication and clearance. Right. Let's let's keep in mind that these outcomes are not predetermined.We have independence in the structure to take a look at things when there's been a complaint made and make sure that when the decision is rendered that it comes from not an internal investigation unit or somebody part of the organization, but rather somebody outside.It's why our courts are independent. It's why the judge wears a black robe to signify neutrality. This is these are values enshrined in our in our in our country. And this today is just a tool for our independent oversight office to be able to hopefully carry out that mission.I want to just signal to colleagues, we've had a good discussion today about the role that the labor negotiations plays in this. And I've heard some new statements, including one echoing our county executives leadership saying, hey, you know, buffer state law, we wouldn't and maybe shouldn't have to negotiate this.We set the labor policy today for the county as the county council. And I think that we shouldn't wait on this issue and also on the ability of Oleo to conduct independent investigations until the next bargaining cycle. I know a lot has happened since we adopted that contract a couple of months ago.And I, I want to just let you all know that we're working on a draft labor policy that would ask the executive to go back to the bargaining table and see if the guild is willing to reopen the contract on those two items and get it done.Because I just don't think you can watch what's occurred here in America and have the same answer that we've had for a decade, which is no. And if it is no, I think that tells us some valuable information about what policy responses and what budget steps we might need to take.Because as I said at the last meeting, we talked about this on Friday. I think our public wants us to fund a law enforcement system that protects and serves in a fair and just way. And effective oversight and transparency is a part of us, a critical part of that and is necessary, in my view, before significant fundsare put in. So I think the governor about it, she got it right. This is like almost a no brainer. We've already done it. The ordinance, this enshrines it if the voters approve it in our county constitution and courage colleagues support.Appreciate the co-sponsors that have come on councilmembers alkali co wells and McDermott.

Agenda Item one Resolution 31917. Recognizing the importance of our health care workers supporting the unionized workers of SEIU Healthcare 1189 Northwest exercising their right to strike and withhold their labor.Cast member back.Shop. Thank you very much. And colleagues, thank you for voting with me on this resolution. It's recognizing the importance of all of our health care workers and supporting the unionized workers of SEIU Health Care 1199 Northwest to exercise their right to strike and withhold their labor.Clearly, these health care workers don't want to be doing that. We know their hearts. We and for those of you who are in the audience, I just want you to know how much we appreciate you. I think that Alison Eisinger from my office is over there.And. Yes. Alison McClain, thank you. Alison Wright, my legislative aide, who I think I ought to know by now, thank you for being here and for bringing this forward. And I am not blowing any secrets. You've been so honorable about this.Alison's baby was born at only 26 weeks. His name is Aiden. Right? And Aiden is in the hospital right now at Swedish. And we are doing everything. The family is doing everything that they can to take care of that little boy and they need the nurses.So I am honored to bring forward this resolution and just let people know that this is about safety for patients and workers. It's about wages and benefits. Yes. But mostly it's about the respect that they need and deserve.And we need these vacancies filled and we need to take care of Aiden. So I ask to pass this resolution.Thank you, Councilman Baxter, and thank you for bringing this forward. Any comments, questions or comments from any of our colleagues, council members who want.Thank you, President Howell. I needless to say, as an elected representative, working people and also as a rank and file teachers union member myself, I strongly support this resolution and I'm in complete solidarity with SEIU 1199 Northwest and all the healthcare workers they represent over the last several months.My staff and I and many of the community supporters, we have all marched with Swedish Providence workers and learned about their struggles. We've learned about the chronic short staffing that got to move back or to mention that endangers vote patient safety, and about the health care workers who are in jeopardy of losing their own health care benefitsbecause Swedish providence wants to cut them. That's the irony we're facing here. It's outrageous that the health care system that operates 14 hospitals, hundreds of ambulatory care sites, and that generates $7.6 billion and pays its top 15 executives $41 million should treat its workers and our communities with such a cavalier attitude.Swedish Province's Profits Before Patients and caregivers attitude is precisely why we need to urgently fight for Medicare for All in this country. We need to put patients before profits. And if healthcare workers must strike and are forced to strike for a decent contract, it is entirely because of the failure of the Swedish Providence executives to support workersand patients. And if Swedish forces healthcare workers to strike, then socialist alternative. And I will be on the picket lines and I have no doubt many community members will be in support of you. And just very quickly, on a personal note, this whole campaign, you know, the reelection campaign that was so, you know, massively attacked by theSeattle Times editorial board, all the corporate elite of the city, Amazon among them. It took a real toll on all the campaign activists, including myself. And the day after election night, my health just and I'm and I don't usually share personal stuff, but I'm sharing this because it's relevant here, really.It's like my body got the memo that it's okay to fall sick. And I ended up in urgent care several times in the just in 15 days. And and it's when you are truly vulnerable and you end up in a health care facility and you see the dedication and just incredible caring with which the health health careproviders address your needs and the needs of everybody who there all the patients who are there. It's really palpable why we should all be standing with our health care workers. And so I'm proud to be standing with you.Thank you. Councilmember Swan. Councilmember Mosquito.Thank you, Mr. President. Today, I'm honored to be standing in solidarity with the 1199 workers from SEIU Healthcare Northwest. Today, I'm honored to be standing with them in their call for a contract that respects the work that they do every single day, the care that they put into caring for their patients and our community.It will come as no surprise that I stand in solidarity with these workers as a long time labor activist and union member. But today, it's personal. Today I stand here with Camila, my daughter, who is healthy today because of the workers at SEIU 1199, the workers who helped to make sure that in the first three days ofher life they were there 24 seven. It's those workers who came in every few hours to check her vitals to make sure that she was healthy. Who got the poop out of her lungs when she came out to make sure that she was breathing and to make sure that she was weighed and that she was clean andthat we felt cared for. It's the workers in the delivery room, in the triage room. It's the folks who clean the room every day. It's the people who came in every single day from the people who take out the trash to the ones who are making sure that all the stitches are put in there.Right. Those are the folks who make us healthy. The workers. SEIU 1199, Health Care Northwest workers. Those are the folks who made us healthy. It wasn't the broken elevator that didn't work. And to our post triage area. It wasn't the light that wouldn't turn on when we needed the post delivery services.And it wasn't the hot water that didn't work in my sink that made it a great experience. It was the workers. When you're sitting on $23 billion in revenue. $11.3 billion in cash reserves. $780 million in profit. And an $11.5 million in compensation for the CEO.You would think that those things would be cared for. The elevator, the light, the hot water. But my God, we need our workers taken care of. When you are sitting on that much revenue, it is the workers who make that place function and make our community safe.So do it for the folks that we've heard about every single day. Do it for the workers who talk about not being able to afford to live in the city anymore because they don't get the compensation. Like I heard about the people who talk about crying on the way to work every day because their schedules are gettingmessed with the ratios, the nurse, the patient ratios that haven't been adequately staffed and the the refusal to hear the nurses and the health care team when they say they need more adequate staffing, do it for those folks who say that they used to love coming to work, that all they wanted to do was be a healthcare professional. Do it for them. Do it for folks like me, for mothers like Allison, for the folks who go to the McHugh, do it for the patients that they take care of. Respect your workers. And by respecting your workers, you will respect your community, respect the bargaining process.So no one ever has to worry about crossing that picket line because we respect workers and we want that contract to be passed. Now, do it for the workers we honor, usually of 1199.Oh. Does anyone dare speak after that? Thank you, Councilmember. Scared. I think we all felt that in the room, in the viewing audience. Okay. I think that would be an appropriate signal for us to vote on this important legislation.So I will move to adopt resolution 31917. It's moved. And second, those in favor of adoption of the resolution. Please vote i i those opposed vote no. The motion carries and the chair will sign it.Thank you.Okay.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nBill passes and chair of the Senate. Please read agenda item number three. You can shorten the title if you like.Agenda item three Council Bill 119425 An ordinance authorizing in 2018 acceptance of funding from non city sources. The committee recommends the bill pass.Okay. Cast member. We believe we'll have an amendment at some point.Yes, we do. And I will look forward to talking about that and try to address it a little bit before we get there. So this fourth grant acceptance ordinance authorizes our city departments to accept 45 grants that total approximately $12 million from external sources to support a range of purposes, as well as a $25 million loan forthe Seattle Public Utilities ship canal water quality projects. We have in our materials in front of us a long list of those grants and the various loans. There's also one item here that was a concern to the committee, and we reached out to Councilmember Gonzales, his office.This is a grant from ICE, from the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. All of us sort of sat up straight when we saw this. What it is, is a reimbursement to Seattle Police Department. Again, it's a reimbursement for overtime that's associated with investigations related to narcotics, money and other contraband at ports and borders.There is no nexus in this grant to immigration. It is a pass through. What? When I asked further questions from CBO, our Budget Office, the majority of reimbursable hours for the Homeland Security Investigations Task Force were spent on narcotics related criminal investigations.As coordination and cooperation with this task force is limited to the investigation of criminal activities and never involved immigration enforcement. All task force activities are conducted in compliance with CPD policy 6.020, which says that SPD employees will not initiate, maintain or participate in any police action based on the individual's immigration status.So I want to say thank you to central staff and thank you to our Budget Office for confirming that. And with that, I'm going to entertain the amendment. I believe.Customer.Herbold Thank you. I would like to propose an amendment that does two items. The first is related to what I raised as a concern in council briefings this morning, and that's an amendment to make clear that in the Lohmann Beach Seawall Removal Project that the city will consider potential mitigation measures associated with concerns about impacts about theremoval of the city's seawall wall and whether or not that might impact the condition of the private seawalls abutting the city seawall. The second item was identified this morning completely unrelated to that issue. It's just a small technical error correcting a reference to the fourth quarter supplemental in the bill.They're second a second them.Okay. So any questions on the basically a substitute version? Councilmember Gonzales.Thank you. Council President I know. Question I just want to remark that I'm going to vote in favor of this amendment, but I will I intend to vote no on the underlying bill. And before we call the underlying bill up for a vote, I'd like to have an opportunity to say.Very good. Okay. So we have an amendment in front of us right now, which is basically substituting version two for version D, one C, as my notes would suggest. Okay. Any questions on the amendment? All those in favor of the amendment.Please vote. I oppose. The ayes have it. So now I have an amended piece of legislation as you want to speak to it. Councilman. Back shore.Or.No, I know. I'm I'm finished. Something that we just need to move forward with to accept these grants. But I respect that Councilmember Gonzalez has something she'd like to say.Very good, Councilman Gonzales.Thank you. I will make this really quick. It's very rare that I would vote no to reject money that is coming to us. But I feel really strongly that I can't vote in favor of accepting a grant from from ICE, which is the overarching agency that does engage in immigration enforcement, that leads to the incarceration and detentionand inhumane practice of deporting and separating families in our country. And while I recognize that there are values added in terms of Homeland Security Investigations Unit to the issues related to public safety that are really important, I think that I still continue to have a lot of concerns about how HCA bleeds into some areas of immigration enforcement. And in fact, if you go to their Web page and look at their different divisions that they have, one includes a description of what is referred to as the Joint Intelligence Operation Center, which again is housed under H as I and as part of the overarching work of this particular division of ICE that squarely focuses on, quote, partnering with ICE to vigilantly enforce the nation's immigrant immigration and customs laws. Given my very strong position on continuing to be a welcoming city and on my ongoing concerns that while I recognize that US PD feels that they need to partner in limited circumstances with HSA, I cannot support ongoing partnership until I know more about the fullbreadth of how our department engages with HSA and have continued to have questions about that now and have had questions about that partnership in the past and just cannot accept it, can't vote yes in favor of these particular this particular grant.Okay. Any other comments? If not, please call the role on the passage of Council 119425 as amended.O'BRIEN Make sure I.GONZALEZ No.HERBOLD No.JOHNSON. All right. President Herrell I. Three in favor, two opposed. Therefore in favor to oppose.Or so the bill passes.Fails.If the bill fails and chair will not sign. So. Okay.So how many knows how many yeses to.Support or to.Show that's not a you.Know.So get Deborah on the phone.Well, is there a way to amend the bill to strip out that one thing and consider that at a later date? Yeah.So what I'll have to do is not do anything on the fly, and we'll move to the next agenda item and we'll figure out what our. Okay. So I could make a motion to reconsider. Okay. So I've been told by the clerk, thank you for that, that I can make a motion to reconsider it on a datecertain and that date certain to be January 7th. And if the motion passes, the bill still failed today, but we have the right to reconsider it on the seventh. Okay, so I'll make the motion and I'll explain it again.Can we just talk about that other option that was mentioned rather than just bringing it back, bringing it back without.Concern or worse?No, bringing about without that grant acceptance.So I was half listening to that since I was blindside. So what was the other suggestion that I didn't catch?Amending the legislation.Or amending the legislation just to pull out the. That was like 95,000 or something like that. I see. The bill failed. So. So I'll ask the clerk. Can we. The bill failed. How do I amend a failed bill.When folks would have to move to reconsider and.So we could reconsider it today? Yeah. Just one of the issues. Will we have time to go through the legal process as we would for any amendment? Okay. Very good for you and your A-game today, Joe. So we're going to what what's.What we could do is move to reconsider to the end of today's agenda. And perhaps law can give us that some input on whether we can pull that piece out of it. It's as simple as that.So we also we also have a good.Course of action.Well, that's not that that's not process. Okay. So let.Me ask a quick.Question. Yes, you may.Does the removal of this particular grant impact the title of the bill as introduced? I don't know. I haven't read the bill in total.Well, I don't know either, but I would think not, but.Well, let me.Why are you asking?Well, because the title includes a reference to grants being accepted by the Seattle Police Department. If this is the only grant being accepted by the Seattle.So.Then that would be a bill title change and could not be reconsidered and amended version of it cannot be reconsidered today.We do have other grants by the Seattle Police Department that are being that are included in this. So there's one.Can you talk into the microphone to the audience?I know we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. We've got nine grants so that if we remove the 90,000 from the police department, there's still would be eight. That would be included for the police department.Council President.Yes.I would maybe suggest we suspend the rules and let central staff come to the microphone just to give us some clarity for a second. And then that will help us decide on clarity.Clarity on what?Councilmember O'Brien. To your question about could we amend the bill today to remove that both the technical question and is there simply enough time to do that? But we need to put it off at.Know if that's something central staff can answer.That was my point, Ari, but that's fine. Why don't we why don't we suspend the rules just a little and put and if there's if you are, I'm going to move to suspend the rules to here unless there's any objection.If you come to the microphone and if you still need some time, that would help us. And perhaps you should consider this motion to reconsider toward the end of the meeting. So go ahead and always identify yourself. Thank you.Hello. I'm Eric, son of your council central staff adjusting to my new location. So there are other grants, as indicated, that are being awarded or would be approved in this ordinance. The removal of the one item is something that that technically, I believe we could accomplish within a relatively short time frame.I don't know exactly how long you expect the remainder of the meetings business to take, but I.But.There's interest on the part of the council I will go and begin working on on a different version. It's a matter of a mission which is easier than a matter of additions.Well, okay, any other questions? So what we'll try to do? Well, I'm going to suggest a motion to reconsider by the end of the meeting. If we are not finished and I'll look at what our options are, whether we'll consider it another day.I don't know if it's so time sensitive. We can't do it in January. I just don't know. And the acceptance of months, perhaps it is.I would just say that the Budget Office has suggested that we need this money to spend before the end of the year from grants. And I would recommend that we move forward. And to the extent that we can just withdraw that $90,000.Grant, I.Wasn't suggesting we don't do that. I would just suggesting that if we don't have it finished by the end of this agenda, we just can't sit here and look at each other for 20 minutes. And so I was going to say, let's revisit it then.And perhaps you could find the my guess would be dealing with the federal government that two or three weeks is going to make a huge amount of difference. But just clarify it if we have to do.It today might be closed for a week.So I just want to add that the this the particular funding that I am taking issue with that is a grant from HSA, but that's a reimbursement. Those dollars have already been spent. But I think that council members have expressed concern about either spending or reimbursement of the other items that are listed in the summary that areattached to the Council bill, which again, I don't oppose those other grant acceptances. I just have issue with this one.So so if I may, what I believe Councilmember Bagshaw was speaking to is that, you know, there are a number of appropriations in the supplemental ordinance that you just acted on that are backed by other grants. And so today, I think the question is not necessarily so much of the amount of time that is available to thecity, to the council to approve the acceptance of the grants eventually. But the appropriations that are in the fourth quarter supplemental that are backed by those grants are contingent upon the acceptance of the grants. And so what would be the issue potentially is not having those appropriations for the 2018 budget in 2018.On the other items.I don't understand what you just said.Actually, I do. And so if I can try this one more time that we have a supplemental budget and the reason why Councilmember Suarez and again, thank you Councilmember Juarez for voting with us on that was that we had to be able to pass that out today to be able to make payments before the end of 2018. And the grants will assist us in making those payments, some as general fund and some where we're backed by these grants. So if we can today take out exclude 1.37, which is the reimbursement for the police department and be able to remove that and then vote for all of the other grants.That would be much appreciated by our CBO and the mayor's office in particular, who have signed these bills.Well-spoken.Okay.Well, at the risk of. The the night. How much money is that?$99,000.Right. The exact amounts of the $90,000. It may very well not be approved by our action today. Are we keeping alive the possibility to still get it through our actions if we reconsider it? Because while I respect Council Member Gonzalez's principal position on this, I may not share it if it's reimbursement for moneys that we of workwe've already done. So I want to make sure that at least we could preserve I could preserve my argument to get that reimbursement, because that 9000 is going to have to come from somewhere. And I may just cut in some other central services.So the the appropriations the grant backed appropriations in the supplemental are contingent upon the acceptance of the grants. And so so that's the first issue. But the approval of removing some of the grants and being silent on another grant would not, in and of itself constitute a rejection of that one grant.Now, I don't know enough about the background of the particular $90,000 grant to know what time by when it must be its acceptance must be approved. There may be more time to accept that. But what? But the approving the receipt of the other grant moneys would not affect that question.Okay.Let me just just one minute. The there was one suggestion that got lost in the shuffle about ad and councilmember war on here. And I'm just going to see from a practical standpoint whether she's still following the information or not.Councilmember words, are you still on the line? She is not. So I think I lost that possibility as well. Okay. Just wanted someone to make that suggestion. So. So. Okay, so let's do this. Um, I'm going to make a motion that we reconsider.Council Bill 119425 as amended, reconsidered at the end of today's agenda during the adoption of other legislation section second. Okay. Any discussion on that? All those in favor say I. I opposed. The ayes have it. So we will reconsider the end of today's agenda.President Herrell Yes, we are reconsidering it at the end of today's agenda for the purposes of amending it or proposing an amendment to remove the 95,000 or having a vote with an additional council member on the existing.Good question. Both. That's why I stated what I was going to do during the other members was also see whether council member, whereas could be available and also see whether we can just take that out. Because what if they come back and say you just can't take it out?I don't know. So I made it vague to reconsider, to pursue all options. We're just reconsidering it.So we've got something here. What do you got?Well, let's. Can we just go two years worth of action here. So let's.Go. The president. Yes. I appreciate that clarity, and I appreciate the question. Sorry. So the grant acceptance ordinance does not require a supermajority, unlike the supplemental. That was all I want to point out. But.But it requires a majority. And she would have been very shy. So I didn't suggest we need we had 42 so it'd be five two if she'd voted in favor. It could be for three for all I know.I don't know. Might be twice.Oh, really?I'm sorry. Okay. Very good. So. Okay, so.Talk to council president because remember, I appreciate flexibility with this, and I. I appreciate the move to reconsider. There would need to be a vote again to add another council member who's not present, I believe. And so I think that's a an open discussion for me.I'm I'm a little uncomfortable with us moving back and forth here on this. And so I.Well, I'm uncomfortable with not having this during the briefing discussion where we could have prepared our agenda a little better.Understood.I mean, I to be fair, I did advise Councilmember Backchannels Office this morning that I was going to have this position. So I.Know.But that's just my, my, my one vote.I understand it.Okay. That's probably not possible. Not knowing the possibilities, I tried to preserve all the possibilities. So that looks like Councilman Wirtz may not be available anyway. Okay, that's a lot of fun. So let me just be clear what we're trying to do.We are going to move on with the agenda. At the end of our agenda, we will revisit Council Bill 119425 as amended. We may not vote on it, we may vote on it, but we'll just have it. We'll decide at that point.But we've preserved our right to make that decision at the end. Okay. Okay. So let's move on to agenda item number four.Okay.Agenda item for Council Bill 119429 An ordinance relating to fees charged by the Seattle Animal Shelter and amending Chapter nine point to six of the Seattle Municipal Code to make technical corrections. The committee recommends the bill pass.\nReasoning:",
        "answer": "The meeting transcript discusses the passing of Council Bill 119425, which authorizes the acceptance of funding from non-city sources. The bill was initially rejected due to concerns over a grant from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The council members discussed the possibility of amending the bill to exclude the controversial grant and reconsidering the bill at a later date. The transcript also mentions the introduction of Council Bill 119429 related to fees charged by the Seattle Animal Shelter.Therefore, the summary of the meeting transcripts is:\nAN ORDINANCE authorizing, in 2018, acceptance of funding from non-City sources; authorizing the heads of the Executive Department, Department of Parks and Recreation, Human Services Department, Law Department, Seattle Police Department, Seattle Fire Department, Department of Construction and Inspections, Seattle City Light, and Seattle Public Utilities to accept specified grants, private funding, and subsidized loans and to execute, deliver, and perform corresponding agreements; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts."

Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThen, unless there's objection, we will expedite, which means that it will be on the June 15th Council agenda. Hearing no objection. That's what we will do. And that takes us to item six in today's agenda, proposed ordinance 2021 185 would also send a proposed charter amendment to the November ballot.This would. This deals with the timelines for referendums and initiatives, which was also briefed at our last meeting. We have Jake Treacy from council staff here to reorient us as we want us to this legislation and its amendment.Jake. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Jake Treacy Council Staff The materials for 2020 10185 begin on page 14 of your packet. The work for this item was done by Miranda less than ten council staff. I'm just filling in for her today.So, as you'll recall from the last meeting, this item would place on the next general election ballot a proposed charter amendment that would update the charter by making changes pertaining to referendum and initiative timelines and clarifying terms and bringing the charter into compliance with state law.With regards to such timelines, Table one on page 16 of your packet provides a summary of the proposed changes as compared to the current charter language. In addition to technical changes and changes intended to align with state law, the ordinance proposed would specify that initiatives and referenda should appear on the next general election ballot after the respectivepetition filing timelines have been completed unless the Council specifies an earlier time. Currently, the code says it could go on the next general or a special election ballot. So this will default to general unless council made other arrangements.It would clarify that it is the intent to file a referendum that must be submitted before the original effective date of the ordinance, not the signed petitions themselves. Those will need to be filed with council no later than 45 days after enactment of the ordinance.It would also specify that council cannot adopt an initiative by ordinance and thereby therefore thereby avoid a vote by the public only to immediately adopt the new ordinance amending that language. Any ordinance adopted in response to an initiative petition would not be allowed to be amended or repealed by the Council for two years following the effective dateof that ordinance, except by an ordinance adopted by a minimum two thirds vote of all members of the Council. There's also a proposed striking amendment that would make technical and clarifying changes and would make a change so that if a valid referendum petition is submitted to the court from the County Council, the effective date of the ordinancewould be 90 days after its enactment, rather than 60 days as proposed in the underlying ordinance and 45 days as is the case currently. And I'm happy to answer any questions. Any questions? Mr. Chair, council member. DUNN Thank you, Mr. Chair.What was the genesis of all this? I missed that. How did this whole process to revise and update these rules relating to the referendum process come to pass was initiated by the Charter Review Commission or someone else? A Yes, that's correct.It was a recommendation of the Charter Review Commission, and I believe the ordinance, as is before you, is in the form that the Charter Commission Review Commission recommended. All right. Thank you.Mr. Chair.Councilmember Gallucci.Thank you. Just to add a little more context to Councilmember Dunn's question. You may recall, Councilmember Dunn, there was an attempt by a group of citizens to put a measure, an initiative on the ballot on a for an initiative seeking county on the ballot of 2 to 3 years ago.And one of the things that came out during that process was that our rules were contradictory and hard to understand. And in fact, although those residents submitted the requisite number of signatures by the date, they were told they still were too late to make the ballot they were aiming for because our rules did not allow for allof the process steps that were required. And so after that happened, you know, regardless of the substance of that, our process was clearly not working. And so after that, my office and I took it upon ourselves to try to fix the rules which required a change to ordinance and charter.We've already adopted changes to the ordinances, our ordinances to put them in line with state law and each other. This change to the charter would kind of complete the circle of process improvement here so that there is a clear, stepwise path to take to do either an initiative or a referendum in King County.You know, by the way, not a huge fan of this way of legislating, but if we're going to have this is available to people, we should be upfront and honest with them about how long it really takes so that if they put the effort in, they're not told at the end of the day, oops, sorry, you can'tgo on the ballot anyway. So that that's a little bit more of the flavor of it.Thanks for that clarification. That's helpful. Lambert because remember Lambert.Real quick questions. Why do we move from 45 days for it to become effective to 90 days?My understanding is that that was requested by the executive side or it was it was so that there was enough time on staff's part in order to do the processing. But the sponsor might have more information on that.Because it seems that when people are doing this, they want to do it as quickly as possible. And so that seems like an awfully long time. And then when we're talking about notifying the clerk and writing a we defined writing.I know we talked about this before, but I do writing to include by email.I would have to follow up with you on that. I believe that they accept it by email, but I can confirm that.Okay. And then my last question is on page seven. It's. Because he's 17. They find it where they were talking about it real quick again are. You have to go on. Only the general ballot. Yes. The last part under 30.50 on page 17.The last bullet specified in Mississippi are only a general election unless the council specifies an earlier date. So. It seems a little redundant in some ways because it is a target, but we could pick any date we want.So explain why that's called out so clearly. And do we have authority? Supposing a city says, I really want this done quickly and I want it on April ballot. And for some reason we don't like whatever that is.We're sorry we had to wait till the November ballot. Is that a possibility that they could create?So I can say that the the existing rules say it goes on either the next special or the next general election ballot, whichever one comes first. So and this would go to just the next general election ballot, unless the council unless the council said, yes, it's going to go into a special election prior to that.So it would be up to the council to decide if it can go on an earlier date or if it defaults to the general election ballot. I think that was a recommendation that came out of the Charter Review Commission.All right. Thank you very much.You're very welcome. See no further questions. Council member Banducci.Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would like to move that. We approve a proposed motion 2020 10185 with a do pass recommendation. Councilor Reason is House.Member Bill Duty has moved it. We give it to pass. Recommendation to propose motion ordinance 2021 185. Councilmember Balducci.I understand there is also an amendment. I don't know if would like to brief that first or have me move it first.I believe Jake spoke to it. You know, it just it is striking the amendment S1 on page 31.Yes. Moving on to S1.S1 is before us. See no discussion. All those in favor of approving amendment S1 please signify by saying.Ii1i.Opposed nay. The ayes have it and the amendment is adopted for the discussion on ordinance 2021 185 as amended.Mr. Charles, speak to a.Council member about duty.Thank you. As I said earlier, this is really the end of a kind of a journey of legislative cleanup we've been on to make sure that these processes are clear and implementable so that if and when groups of residents go to the effort to either run a referendum or initiative in King County, our rules make sense andthey can be understood. We created a Gantt chart, which I will gladly share with anybody that shows sort of when all the steps have to happen in order. The elections is very much on board with clarifying these processes, so it's really clear what they have to do and when.Sometimes in these processes, the council has a role. It's clear what we have to do and when it just makes it possible for residents to access their government in this way. In response to one of Councilmember Lambert's questions, what the the amended ordinance would do if adopted into the charter by the voters is it would extend theentire process to a total of 90 days instead of a total of 60 days. So it's long, but it's not really ridiculously long. And the reason is to allow election 40 days to verify signatures. That sounded like a lot to me too, when election proposed it.But when I thought about it and listening to what they were saying, often the need to verify very large stacks of many, many thousands of signatures hits around the same time as they're working on an election, and they don't have people hanging around just to sit down and do this work.So to make sure that they were allowed ample time and could always meet their deadlines, this was what they thought was was required. And because the goal of this whole change is to make sure that we can meet our marks and that if we tell somebody who comes in with a petition, if you do everything you're supposedto in 90 days, you will be able to get on the November ballot. We want to be able to make that statement and make it true. And so this allows ample time so that we can always feel confident that we can do that.And that's the entire purpose of the change. I really appreciate the charter commission taking this up and looking at it very closely and passing it on to us because it does complete a path that we were already on to really fix one of our one of our one of our operating processes that we have here at KingCounty Government. And I urge everyone support.For the discussion. Just a quick.Question, if I might, Mr..Councilmember, about.This touches on an inquiry that Councilmember Lambert raised, and that is that kind of default to the next general election. And I wondered if there was kind of a pro and con assessment of that. I think of that initiative and referendum was kind of coming out of the populist movement.If my memory if my history serves me correctly, it's kind of a Western states thing and it's kind of it's designed as the ultimate testing of power in the people when their elected representatives maybe get a little sidetracked from what the majority wants on on a key issue.And, and, and I when I think about that, I it seems like that that a defaulting to the next general election could really lengthen the process for the people's voice to be heard on an issue of of major importance.And I understand that that there's a counter to that in this legislation where we could we could put it on a special ballot or a primary, for example. But that kind of seems to be counter to the general thrust of the initiative and referendum power.And so I'm wondering what the discussion was in the Charter Review Commission about that issue of defaulting to the to the next general, which is different than what we do today, as I understand it goes on the next election ballot.Unfortunately, Councilmember, I do not have that information in front of me. I'm sure if Miranda was here today, she would be able to give you a thorough background on that. But I'll be happy to follow up with you on that.Okay, Jeff, maybe it was chiming in there perhaps or wanting to.I was just going to say the exact same magnitude. All right.I guess I would say I'd be supportive today, but I'm interested in that angle as we take it up at full council and make sure that we're comfortable with that. Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember Dombrowski. And not knowing the thinking of the charter review commission at all. It occurs to me that with the turnout in the general election, there's certainly more of the electorate, more of the public participating in that decision than in a primary and certainly than in a special election.But that's my own thinking at this moment, not at all representing what the term review commission may have been thinking.Fair point. Thank you, Joe.Mr. Chair.Councilmember Lambert.I'm glad you're at least talking about this, because sometimes the November ballot can be very long, very complicated, and people are working on big ticket items and this might be a down ticket item and not get the scrutiny that it might get a smaller election and that the cost of elections, you know, people are pretty clear about, well, I don't want to be the only thing like Councilmember DEMBOSKY asked earlier on, what does it cost? Because if you're going to go on, say, a primary election date, you have most likely other people just to share the costs with you.You don't have more people as a general, but you may have less scrutiny because there'll be more attention on other things. So it could be good and it could be bad. And so I think having the flexibility of the citizens being able to decide, is it better for me to be able to have more bandwidth or isthat better for me? Not so. I think it's a good thing to at least think about.Thank you. Councilmember Mel Duchin, anything to close?I appreciate the discussion, and I think these are issues that we can take up on final passage. If that anyone has any amendments. I just urge them to really think ahead and make sure, because there's a number of hands that have to touch these processes, including elections, our own clerk's office, etc..So if we're going to make changes to this, I really encourage that people check with those folks in-depth as early as possible, because I find that with any like with any process, if you pull the string here, things might happen over here that you're not thinking about.And as I said, the goal of this entire thing is to make the process manageable, clear and doable so that it is a reliable thing for anybody who undertakes this, which is a significant amount of effort. So, yeah, I appreciate the discussion and everyone support I urge yes.Vote here today. Thank you, Mr. Chair.And quickly, please call the roll. Was there a vote on this breaking amendment? I may have missed that. Pardon me.I have it documented that there was a vote on my amendment.Great. Would you please call the roll?Thank you, Mr. Chair. Councilmember Belushi, I.

Then we will be in touch with his office if he wants to follow up before the end of the day as our procedures for remote meetings allow.And without having no other business before us, I guess I should be clear.

Thank you again.13 1337.Next item, please.Item seven. Communication from Councilwoman Gonzalez, Vice Mayor Lowenthal and Councilman Austin. Recommendation to request the city manager to review issues associated with parking impacts to neighborhoods adjoining the Deukmejian courthouse and returned to council with a report within 60 days.Any public comment on the item? Mr. Shelton. Right down.Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Pro tem. I don't know. Are you vice mayor yet? And rest of the city council and staff. My name is Gary Shelton. I live a couple of blocks a year. Chestnut and third in this proposed district.I hope I'm talking on item seven anyway. Last couple of times I've talked on other items and what I meant to you know, what I'm what I'm really hoping is that this is such a unique neighborhood where this parking preferred parking district is is proposed a study for it that I hope we don't have anything of ofa boulder type that would maybe apply to other parts of town that don't have high rises with two or 300 people in a quarter of a block that don't have schools with with very little or no parking, that don't have huge public facilities, that employ thousands of people, that and draw other thousands of people on a dailybasis into the neighborhood who are unused to it. Folks who are coming to court, having to be there at 830 in the morning. They don't even know that. We have one way streets downtown. They're driving around looking for parking.And it's not necessarily that they don't find parking right now. I'm not sure if we're short parking or if it's just hard to get to or if it's underused or just what it is. But I'm hoping that we have an actual study of the conditions that are on the ground here in this area brought back to youfolks. So you have an opportunity to look at what are your options are in fact, parking meters an option? I'm not sure they are because people come to court, for example, and they're going to be there for more than 2 hours, either from 830 in the morning till 1130.And then they don't know what's going to happen the rest of the day. And smart meters, I believe you can't feed and we'll probably have smart meters. I wanted to also mention that there are you know, when it comes to housing and it comes to parking, they're clutch together.They always have been. We always look at the amount of parking versus the amount of housing that we have and there's a need and a demand there. And part of housing includes special needs families. And if you've ever studied or ever read the city's housing element, you'll understand that we pay special attention to the special needs families, which include families which are made up of seniors, large families, female heads of household, disabled members of families and others. These folks all will have special needs. And in this parking impacted neighborhood of mainly lower income and very low income and extremely low income people, you will find those families in abundance.They need to be looked at. And finally, I would I would wonder if the county can't be inclined to come up and step up to its responsibility to provide the parking that its own courthouse is creating a need for.Thank you.Thank you, Mr. Shelton. I see item eight and nine has been withdrawn.Oh, I would like to speak, if I may. Thank you, Gary, for being here. I know you've been very patient with us. And so the reason for me bringing this item forward was merely because, of course, so many downtown residents have been impacted by parking.And so I wanted to make sure that we were super focused on a specific area that I get many calls about, which is the area around the courthouse, the Westgate Gateway neighborhood, as Gary has mentioned. And it also this item also will bring context to the courthouse and what exactly it means, because the courthouse in, you know, when in its inception is supposed to bring over 55,000 individuals to the area, every day I pass by there, there is an influx of people just looking for parking. You can even sometimes get a Starbucks because there's, you know, everybody's parking parked up and there's nowhere to park.And I feel for these residents in there and the impact that they're feeling every single day. I lived there myself for a few years as well, but hopefully I know I've talked to Craig Beck many times and I know he's truly invested in parking.He's worked on parking before, and I know that will come up with some good solutions, whether those are smart meters in some cases, whether they are opportunities for parking district, if that's an opportunity. And also looking at ways to alleviate some some impact for residents, of course, that's the whole motive for this item.So I want to thank the residents, want to thank I see Craig Cogen as well, who I know is invested in this issue. Also, I've talked to him many times about this, so thank you very much for being here as well, Craig.And then also to the other Craig Public Works. I don't know if you wanted to share any information as of now. Craig back. If not, we. I know we have 60 days to do that.Yeah, Councilman, I just. I would.Echo your.Comments, and we support your effort here.We'll go through and do our analysis and provide a report on some options.Wonderful. Thank you very much.Thank you. Comfortable in price.I have no comments. Thank you.No. Councilwoman Munger.Just as a comment to Gary, the courthouse was transferred to the state and so it would be more of.A state discussion now than a county discussion. But if you want to.Link up with our state representatives, many of us do capital on a corner where those state representatives are present and available.Thank you.Please cast your vote. I mean. Yes.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nI believe, to answer this question. We have up. I'm not sure. I don't think we're sharing our screen yet. I believe we had a go ahead location.You said seven or seven and on 569, are we going to do the 569 or seven or seven?You know what? We have 707 cushioned in here between. So it's before 569. Awesome. Yeah.Well, then I will ask the questions on seven or seven. And if our city attorney is here, there were comments, public comments that spoke to this particular one tonight. And I and I know that we don't traditionally speak about settlement agreements on the floor.And so I'm wondering if the city attorney can do a little public education for us right now and explain what is possible with these particular settlement agreements. Do council members actually get to ever decide where the money comes from and what happens if we vote no against these settlement agreements?Thank you for your questions, Councilwoman. We need to have Connor Farley. Raise your hand in the attendees. He's our representative from the city attorney's office. And so, Connor, if you would, please raise your hand and we can get you into the panelist queue.Oh, okay. I guess we have Kirsten Crawford is going to answer instead. Hello, Kirsten.Good evening, everybody. Yes. So we are mandated by law in this particular situation to pay the traffic accident, as Councilman Flynn pointed out, and then Councilman, sit back. I may have missed your other question.What was the second question?Can you? So we had public comments addressing these settlements. And we want I would like you to do a little public education about what power and authority city council has to vote these down or to decide where the money comes from.Oh, so council members, of course, can vote yes or no on almost any matter. In particular, this one. And then this is before council members, because it's a payment out of the claims and liability fund. And there is a threshold amount in our city code that requires council approval.So the claims and liability fund is. Can you can you explain?How that works.Who sets that aside and how much it is every year that would be controlled through the budget process, which, as you know, council members have quite a bit of authority over the budget process. So if council members wanted to vote no against settlement agreements with any entity, whether it's DPD or sheriff or whomever.Can they vote? Can they vote no on a settlement agreement? And could they could they say what fund it would have to come from? You can vote no on this proposed settlement. I can think of examples where a proposed settlement might come with some court's obligations, and then establishing where the money comes from is not something Councilcan unilaterally decide outside the budgetary process. So the answer is no. You can't say where the money will come from to pay the the amount. And so our settlement agreements by the city offered.Contingent upon our approval.Or do they. Okay, got it. Awesome. Thank you. Just wanted to make sure that we are all on the same page about that. You bet. Thank you. Thank you.All right. We've got a few more council members in the queue. We have Councilman Hines.Mr. President. Miss Crawford, I, i i'm not sure I heard the answer to the question. If we vote no, what happens?So the this you know, I don't want to get into the terms of this particular settlement agreement as a general proposition. If a settlement agreement comes to council, it has a provision that is contingent on council approval.In general, if we vote no, does it go back to the attorneys or there's just no settlement dollars or I mean. I guess.I'm. I'm. I'm. I think I have unmuted again.Is it? Can you hear me? Yes. So you here hear? The answer to that question is, you know, kind of case by case specific. But I would expect that in this particular situation, there would be more negotiations by attorneys involved.The one thing I know about this particular situation is it's largely personal injury and traffic accidents are largely driven by state statute.Okay. Thank you, Mrs. Crawford. Thank you, Madam President.Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Flynn.Thank you, Madam President. It is a little painful to listen to in the briefings that we got. What would happen is, if we were to reject this, then the attorneys for the plaintiff, for the the other part, the other party involved would have the option then of going to court.If this isn't already in court and file a lawsuit and if they won, then we'd have to pay out of the same fund where this money is coming from tonight. So. I guess I just wanted to leave it at that.Thank you.Thank you. Councilman. We have Councilwoman Canete. Jump.Thank you. Two questions, I think so. We've established that this is an automobile accident. This is not a use of force case, generally speaking. Ms.. Crawford, if you can talk for a minute about if there's any differences between the police department and, for example, a public works situation.So we have city employees driving vehicles on the city's behalf and a number of departments. To your knowledge, is anything being treated differently here as it would another city driver.Who.Perhaps caused property damage and or injuries in the course of their work for the city? No, not to my knowledge. And I know Connor from litigation and Wendy Shay from the director of litigation are available if they need to correct me or correct the record.But I do want to caution everybody, let's be careful about getting into, you know, having discussions about the terms of the settlement publicly. But no. To answer your question, no. I just want to like Councilman Flynn, I want to establish generally that we as a city, if our employees hurt someone in a car accident on duty, thereare limits to city's liability in state law. But we are responsible to make those individuals whole through an insurance settlement or through insurance, just like any other driver, if they cause an.Act is responsible.Correct? Absolutely. So this is a general proposition that if we cause some harm. So one thing I would say is if this settlement is an approved, potentially the person who is impacted in this accident is not compensated. Correct.That is one potential outcome. Right. Pending pending a trial or whatever may happen in court. The second thing I wanted to ask and again, this is a general proposition our city employees in any way exempt from traffic enforcement in terms of ticketing for if they're going unsafe.Some accidents are unintentional and no one did anything wrong and no tickets are issued. But in your experience, generally speaking, can city employees be ticketed for their driving? In terms of the official driver's license points system and and those types of citations.Generally speaking, city employees can be subject to those.Can you confirm? Yes.That's correct. And then in addition, can you just confirm generally that we have disciplinary systems as well where whether there is or is not a ticket involved in a law enforcement setting, that in addition, there could be disciplinary action or other general actions.Yes. Yes. And all of those proceedings are separate and apart from the personal injury or property damage settlement. Right. So I just I think that's important for folks to understand that no one, as an individual driver, if the accident was their fault, if they violated the law, if they did something wrong, is being protected in any wayfrom those consequences. This is simply about city vehicles, injured, party making them whole, which you know again and even in our police accountability conversations I just this is a comment now even if you think about 217 the state bill, it does two things.It makes law enforcement officers partially liable for their own actions in terms of use of force, but it actually expands the liability for their actions as well to ensure that cities remain liable for the actions of their officers.And that is, you know, in order to ensure that we have a really high motivation to ensure that good things are happening on our watch and not bad things. And so I just want to clarify that nothing about making the victim of a car accident whole, is it all contrary to the idea of accountability for those whomay be harmed in a car accident, whether it's their property or their person? So that was just a comment about why, of course, I'll be supporting this as a general proposition. Thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman CdeBaca.Thank you, Madam President. I see my colleagues getting excited and just want to tell you, simmer down. I did not call this out for a vote. I called it out for questions because we had public comment about it.And I think it's important for us to be able to explain to the public what pieces of settlement and group agreements are disclosed to the public. And perhaps that's something that Kirsten could add right here. What are we allowed to disclose to the public during the set of some settlement agreement of any type?Right now, we've said that it's for a car accident. But if this was for if this was for use of force, what level of detail is available to the public when we're spending public dollars? You know, that is something I would really probably have to defer to my litigation team.So much of what is protected and what's, you know, what information can be waived by the client is is so facts and says so specific. And so if you want to give some time to let the litigation team jump on and and talk about that.But the reason the law provides for confidentiality and privilege is that, you know, it gives parties the opportunity to expose themselves in a way that will, you know, sometimes show the compromises and the weaknesses. And so it's to generate efficiency in the system.So but I don't I it's been a while. I have done a fair share of litigation, but it's been years now. So I will give the litigation team a time to jump on if we need more. I will tell you that I have been in communication with Connor and he did.I do want to correct the record that this would not come back. There would not be additional negotiations. It will go proceed to trial. And with our settlement agreements themselves available to the public in any case. But generally speaking, with certain redactions for private information, payments for settlement are subject to call once they're finalized.Got it. Thank you very much. That's it from my questions.Okay. Thank you, Councilwoman. All right. Next up, Madam Secretary, please put the next item on our screen. Well, I guess that's old language. Look at it on your own screens, everybody. But Councilmember Herndon, would you please put Council Resolution 569 on the floor for adoption, please?\nReasoning:",

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nAll right. Is. Excuse me, is that number 22? Okay. Yes, we're going to we're going to move some call 22. It's going to take us about 5 minutes. And then we're going to go to the big oh, my pool item.Item 22 is a communication from city prosecutor. Recommendation to use City Prosecutor. Budget savings from FBI 19. Increase appropriations in the General Fund by 295,525 in the City Prosecutor Department.Yes. Congressman Mango?Yes. I want to first support. Prosecutor Halbert and all the great work he does. And I appreciate you and I appreciate the work you do. And I even had great hesitation last week with making the option for the city auditor to bring forward her amendment to the floor without going through Budget Oversight Committee.$295,000 is a considerable amount of money, and I appreciate that you have budget savings. And I among our council and a huge advocate for those that save should get to eat a part of their savings. However, at a time when we're facing potential budget shortfalls and we've had hundreds of animal advocates here who can't hire a $40,000a year, part time person to clean animal cages when our be safe programs in the summer cost. $30,000. This could be ten of those programs. I would really appreciate my council colleagues supporting sending this to Budget Oversight Committee.It would not be a long process. The Budget Oversight Committee meets February 11th, and I would be happy to put this on the agenda. But I think it's important for us to do it as a part of a process.And I think it's important for us to make allocations at this level with a global picture, not just with a single part of mind. Furthermore, I support homeless programs and homeless services. We do have a percentage of a specific kind of funding for those types of programs.This is general fund money that could be used for park programs, animal programs, library hours on Sunday and things like that. And so I think that it is important to take a step back further. When I asked Mr. Halbert if it was going out through a contract or any of those things, he was talking about potentially addinga staff member. And it's really hard when our animal control staff make minimum wage and we don't have enough of them to clean cages to make this independent decision for $300,000. So if my colleagues would be supportive of my motion is to send this to Budget Oversight Committee to be agenda ISED for the February 11th meeting.Thank you. And I would also recommend that all department heads who want to do that. Asked to agenda do budget oversight committee.Thank you, Congressman Austin.Thank you. And so we we approved something very similar just this last week for for our city. I know. And and obviously, I'm a member of the Budget Oversight Committee and I'm speaking in favor of this this particular motion.Madam Chair, with all due respect, I mean, I understand where you want to go with this. How do you envision this this working out? It goes to the Budget Oversight Committee and then comes back to the city council.So this money is from prior year savings. Mr. Modica, would you be able to tell me if we took this act tonight versus February 11th, when that money becomes available and in which fiscal year?So that when you put me on the spot, it's probably in the next 30 days or 40 days. We're normally closing at the end of February. I think this request is to do that when we close and it's just you're doing it a little early.So we do have that kind of time available. So what I envision is for us to discuss the priorities. We have a budget meeting that has some discussions from staff on the shortfalls for next year and the potential risks and areas that we have to consider.And I think that this should be discussed as a part of that.So the city prosecutors department had a $591,000 fine, 19 savings in their requesting $295,525. I'm sure during that B or C meeting, we will be discussing how to potentially allocate the balance. Is that.So? Currently, the staff bring forward a set of recommendations for mid-year. Typically, if a department head does not get their money back, it becomes available for divide by nine in the next year. We made some allocations based on savings and so we already put together a list of what would be funded with this money.And so I think it's important for us to make a decision and I will speak on my vote. Last week it was with great hesitation that we made that, and I in hindsight, wish I had not been supportive of that.It was I really feel there has to be a process and I know that I should have started last week. But better to save. Where we are.Okay. I'm going to ask. I know we're on my time and so I'm going to defer and I look forward to hearing from the rest of my colleagues.You're comfortable in your eyes.Thank you. I share the same concerns as Councilman Orson. I understand what Councilman Mongo is saying, but frankly, I think we should start off with congratulations to you for ending the year with a budget surplus as high as you did and not scrambling at the last minute to figure out how to spend every single penny of themoney that was allotted to you and instead telling us honestly what you actually need to help us combat homelessness in the city of Long Beach. I think the fact that you're asking for less than a half or about a half of that is is frankly something you should be rewarded for.And I do not want to. This is a this money was allocated to your department as a department head to be able to make a determination of how best you want to use that money. You ended up with a budget surplus.We want to encourage our department heads to do that and not feel that they might risk losing that money if they come out with a surplus as opposed to a deficit. So I am wholeheartedly in support of approving your request this evening.And and I think the diversion programs that you've been involved in in the city have been extraordinary. They have commanded attention from throughout the nation, and they have come in at a very responsible cost in terms of I know how much these programs cost.Frankly, I'm shocked that you're able to do as much as you do with the budget that you have as a person who does your profession on a daily basis. So I would urge my colleagues to support this item if we're going to have a change of policy regarding surplus having to come to posse first.I'm not opposed to that either, but I don't think we should do it without giving notice to the department heads, because if that's the direction we're going to go, I guarantee you will have less surpluses throughout every department next year.Right.Thank you.Thank you. I agree with Councilmember Austin and Councilmember Price. I applaud you for the budget savings. And I think any time that a department can save money and then be creative with how they want to use those funds to achieve the goal of that department, it's important we support that.Any budget conversations, really, whether it's the body or during the budget process where this entire council gets to weigh in on the budget, I think is is appropriate. Thank you.I come from a.Ago, so I think it's important to note, Ms.. Price, that Councilwoman Price, that the policy is that they do not get to carry it over. We have made an exception for Prosecutor Halbert for two years and we've only made an exception for city auditor out one year.This was the first time it caught me off guard. I have a lot of questions about it, but the policy of the city is that this is not allowed and that is why it's coming to council because it is an exception.At which time last year I made similar comments that we really need a process specifically. There are programs on contingency Sunday library hours, be safe programs and other things that right now Grace is bringing to our February 10th 11th meeting a list of here's the priorities and here's how much money is being rolled over.And so we're only going to be able to fund A through F. And so I think that the council should get to know what that is when making the decision. And we made an exception for Prosecutor Halbert last year and the year before two times.And we made an exception for councilman I'm sorry, a prosecutor, city auditor. O'DOWD One time. But I also believe that we we have a bigger discussion that we started, which is the vacancies. We have department heads who come to us on a consistent basis and say, I need seven staff.And to your point, both Ms.. Pearce and Pryce, there are staff vacancies in development services that each year happen, and each year they ask for more staff, and each year they have a budget savings because they don't fill the staff.Now part of that is because of the process and the specific challenges that we have in civil service. But we need to get to the bottom of whether or not these departments are appropriately staffed. And Council of Prosecutor Halbert would not have been able to use this money and spend it last minute on printer cartridges or whateverhe could, because from what I understand, this is a one off funds. It was salary and employee benefit funding that was available. And from what I had in my very short discussion with him earlier today, a few moments ago, he would be using this money for another staff member for this program, which if he stopped at thesame level he was staffed out last year, he would have the ability to do that anyway. And so. And I don't know what percentage of his total budget is, $300,000. But coming in 1% above or below, it absolutely should be rewarded.And we should have a program that does that. But if we had other departments come forward in my discussions with Mr. Modica, if we had other departments come forward and do the same thing, we would be in a world of hurt and we're already in a position where we cannot fund.What we've approved to finish this year. And so for those reasons, I implore everyone to support the motion on the floor.All right. Thank you very much. My comment on this and my perspective, I don't think Dan would even come to us that this wasn't necessary, whether it's for a staff member or whatever it was, and especially at this time of night, you know, because one thing I do know, if you don't use it, you lose it.And Doug, I think what you're going to use it for is totally acceptable for us. And I'm concerned and I will totally support you tonight on this item. Thank you. Mrs. Cindy has. You know. Okay.I just want to say that I am not saying that what he's asking for is not appropriate. I'm not saying that it's not a good program, and I'm not saying that we wouldn't award it through the process that we have planned on February 11th.All of that is still completely possible because he was so prudent to bring forward the items so early.We hear from him.Of course.If you'd ask him.Yes, but wait till she finish, please. Okay. Mrs.. India's. Oh, yes. Okay. Do our public comment on this, folks. Okay, fine. Now, would you like to speak there.Very briefly and I apologize. I thought this was going to be your fastest item tonight. I didn't know it was going to be the longest. I do believe this is the fifth or sixth year that the council has allowed my budget savings to be reallocated to me.It started, I know, when Councilmember DeLong was on the Budget Oversight Committee. So I do believe there has been a precedent in my office. So I wanted to mention that the second thing is the innovative programs that our office has really is a reflection of a partnership between the council and my office, because I could not havestarted these programs without having the budget savings from previous years reallocated so that we can do creative things that we didn't think of in the current year. So we start programs. We look for grant funding. The biggest reason that I have this much savings are really two reasons.My office has been very aggressive in getting grant funding everywhere we can to bring money into the city of Long Beach. And the second thing is, when we have a vacancy, we delay filling that vacancy as long as we can in order to generate savings, knowing that that savings will help us to fund the next program.So I want to thank you. And I do take to heart all of the comments. And Ms.. Mungo's comments will be taken to heart and I will bring it. Earlier, I was asked to hold off. John GROSS asked me to hold off until January.I was ready to make this request earlier. I would have been happy to bring it to Bossi in October. I was asked to wait till January and then I was asked to cut it in half. This is the first time I've asked for half of the budget savings to be carried over because it was such a largeamount, because the city is in such a financial situation that it's needed. So I was more than happy to do that. But I do appreciate the partnership. I do appreciate the programs we have are a result of your allowing me to do this.So I thank you for that. And next year I'll bring it to BMC right away and get this input as soon as possible. But I do want to thank you again for considering it. Thank you.And us.Thank you and thank you, Doug, for for all that information. I did want to hear from you. I also wanted to thank you for all your hard work that you do. And I will be supporting this. Thank you.What's a woman? Mango.Mr. Halbert, do you know the average amount we've allowed you to roll over in the last five years or approximate?I do not.You know, last year's amount.Of time I had, I don't recall.Mr. Modica, do you have any financial management staff that might know that?I don't think we have that tonight.I would just say to the council that. I appreciate that Prosecutor Halbert has had savings, but if every year he has savings, then potentially he has enough money in the budget to do the program. But I don't know that because I don't have enough information at this time.So that's all. But I really appreciate it. And I do think the program is important. Thank you.Yeah. Okay. So it's no public comment is that we.We the as I understand it, the motion was Councilwoman Mungo's motion to refer to B, O, C and nice and a second.Yes. And I'd like to ask Mr. Halbert if he'd be supportive of that.I would appreciate the council just approving it tonight.I'd like to make a substitute.We've got.To prove.It. I couldn't. Austin, did you say something? Okay. Council. Councilman Austin removed the second. So no, we don't have a motion on the floor and somebody else wants to second. Councilwoman Mangos.I think Councilman Price is going to make a motion.There's no second.Rate so she can make.The original motion.Councilwoman Price, if you want to make a motion.I'd make a motion to approve the request, as indicated in item 22.We have a second.Right. This is it.And then we should have public comment. As for public comment on the motion.Any more public comment?No one should sign up for the public comments.So I appreciate. Okay. Mr. Mongo, you wanna speak one more time about it?I'm just very disappointed because I've tried to do my diligence. I reached out to Mr. Halbert a week ago. I wish he would have been supportive of going through the Budget Oversight Committee, especially since we have plenty of time.But please, please cast your vote.Bush and Kerry's.\nReasoning:",

Here is a side by side compared compared to the table showing the differences between the proposed and existing zone districts, the CM CMC's five and CMC's eight with waivers were introduced build to back and transparency requirements that will result in a more urban, pedestrian friendly built form that is more appropriate for this location.There are also waivers proposed for the portion of the site along Colfax that's rezoning to CMCs eight. These waivers are detailed in the staff report in the application, and they limit the building height to seven storeys and 75 feet.These waivers will not impact the protected district standards imposed by the two unit zoning to the south. These waivers are intended to provide flexibility in accommodating an additional four affordable housing units in close proximity to transit. And they are consistent with CPD's policy of using waivers as a bridge to a future text amendment.As many of you may be aware. CPD is currently working on an affordable housing zoning incentive. And this site is probably going to have would probably qualify as being considered as an incentive area. There's also a development agreement in the form of an affordable housing agreement that has been executed.This agreement goes beyond the build alternative plan as 10% of all units will be income restricted for a period of 99 years at 60 and 80% and my levels, 25% of these income restricted units will be two bedrooms and 10% will be three bedrooms.Further income restricted units will be equitably distributed across the project and constructed of similar quality as the market rate units. As as the project is currently designed, there will be a total of 28 affordable housing units provided. This is in contrast to the four affordable housing units.That would be the results of the build alternative plan calculation. Information on the rest of this application was sent in late November. At that time, the applicant.Continued to.Engage with the community. They worked with hosts to develop that affordable housing agreement, and they worked with CPD to craft the waiver language. This resulted in a revised application being submitted in late August. At the time, the staff report was sent out.We have received 18 letters of support, including one from the VA on the Lincoln Park neighborhood and one letter of concern and one letter in opposition. Moving to the criteria. There are four plans that impact the subject property beginning with comprehensive plan 2040.This proposed rezoning is consistent with many of the strategies dealing with equitable, affordable and inclusive, strong and authentic neighborhoods and environmentally resilient goals and strategies. Moving the blueprint. DENVER The subject property is mapped as part of the general urban neighborhood context.The predominant land use in these areas is multi-unit residential and there is a regular street grid with consistent alley access. However, this application is proposing the urban center neighborhood context, which is more appropriate as the site is across the street from light rail station in close proximity to downtown Denver and nearer to campus.As Blueprint Denver master at a citywide scale. Limited flexibility can be interpreted as long as the request furthers planned goals and fits with the overall intent of the context map, which this does.And is consistent.The future place map designates this property as a community corridor. Here we envision a mix of office, commercial and residential uses with buildings generally up to eight storeys in height and given the street type of Colfax Avenue being a downtown arterial.The increased height here does make sense, and it is still less given the waivers that will limit the property to seven storeys instead of eight. So provide that transition to the neighborhood, to the south. This is part of the community centers and corridors growth area strategy where we envision 25% of new housing and 20% of new employmentby 2040. Next, we have the Lincoln Park neighborhood plan. This plan was adopted in 2010 and envisions the area as a stable, mixed income neighborhood that provides connections to the surrounding neighborhoods downtown and the area of campus. The Framework Plan identifies the subject property as both mixed use retail and mixed use commercial, and the application of mixeduse zoning as prescribed in these places and also in areas of change which these properties were designated as in Blueprint Number 22. The Building Heights Annapolis plan recommends up to five stories along Colfax and up to two stories along with along Kalama Street, closer to 14th Avenue.However, the plan does anticipate higher intensity zoning changes, and in these instances, applicants must substantially mitigate negative impacts.And approve the plan goals.So in working with the community, the applicant has been able to. Provide an affordable housing agreement and increase the amount of retail based on the neighborhood inputs. They have also relocated truck access. Based on neighborhood alley concerns. And they've also planted their plan to do live working.That's what they plan streets to better integrate with the residential area. And lastly, they are intending a public art component to be along Kalama Street to better integrate into the art district on Santa Fe. Well, it's not a supplemental plan to comp plan.This rezoning does mean housing and inclusive Denver and it will be providing affordable housing in areas of opportunity and promoting mixed income retail housing. Staff also finds that this reasoning meets the next two criteria as a result of the uniformity of district regulations and also further public health, safety and welfare through implementing adopted plans, facilitating increased housingdensity in transit, and providing better health outcomes through increased physical activity within walkable distances. There are two justifying circumstances mentioned for this reasoning. The first is change or changing conditions in the surrounding area. Recent physical changes include the opening of new multi-unit residential projects within close proximity to the site, as well as significant public and private investmentsalong the Santa Fe Corridor. And the second justified circumstance points to the fact that the subject property currently zoned before with waivers you are one you have to retain. Former Chapter 59 after the city adopted the Denver zoning code.Lastly, the proposed rezoning is consistent with the urban center neighborhood context that exists in the surrounding area and with the purpose and intent statements for both Cemex five and CMC's eight. City staff recommends approval based on all review criteria met.I'm happy to answer questions. And also we have Andrew from hosts.Who can.Answer the questions about the voluntary housing agreement. Thank you.All right. Thank you very much, Brandon. There has been no written testimony submitted regarding Council Bill 1086, and we have four individuals signed up to speak this evening, and our first speaker is Joe Swanson. All right. I thought we had Joe.All right, Joe, we're getting you promoted up into the panelist. And you might have to meet yourself, Joe. There you go.This is Joe Swenson. And everybody hear me? Okay. Go ahead. Great. My name is Joe Swenson. My address is 950 17th Street in Denver, Colorado. I'm a senior manager of real estate development at the Opus Group based here in Denver.And I like to thank you and city staff for your work on this project. We appreciate the opportunity to present to you and look forward to this evening's discussion. You're with us tonight. We have several of our team members.I'll be joined in this presentation by Brian Connolly from Don Johnson. And all of us are available to answer your questions. The oldest group is a 65 year old company based in Minneapolis, has had a presence in the Denver community for over 25 years.We have a strong community focus and commitment to Denver, not only donate millions of dollars per year to community organizations, but also volunteer our time to partner for a greater impact. Our company's focus on community has driven our work on this project, and because of that, we began our engagement efforts over 15 months ago.From the beginning, it was important for us to get early input and feedback and the community's vision for this property. We held six meetings with the registered neighborhood organization before even submitting our zoning application and then a number of individual conversations with our members throughout this process.In addition, we held meetings with the Neighborhood Equity and Stabilization Group hosts Denver Housing Authority, the District of Santa Fe and the Santa Fe Business District. Affordable housing is a very important component of the proposed rezoning request. A project team worked with House to negotiate an affordable housing agreement that runs the land for 99 year period.The affordable component of the rezoning will allow for 60% and 80%, and my units will have a wide variety of unit types and sizes. We've also dedicated all of our three bedroom units to be affordable. The proposed zoning will create conditions that can benefit the community in a variety of ways.Early on, the neighborhood organization told us that this property is viewed as a gateway to the neighborhood in the art district. The new zoning request will help us achieve the vision of the piano as follows. The proposed zoning creates an opportunity for transit oriented projects across the complex light rail station.The new zoning will allow for live work units where an owner can operate a business on the ground floor while living upstairs, decreasing the expense of operating a small business. The proposed zoning requires street level activation along the Colfax frontage, allowing for a variety of users, including restaurants or businesses that serve the community.With the proposed zoning. Opus will partner with the art district on Santa Fe. To assist with art curation and public art features surrounding the property. Finally, the rezoning will create conditions to support a great new project that will offer improvements in the alley, new sidewalks, utility upgrades, pedestrian plaza and added greenspace.Brian Conaway will not talk about playing guidance. Thank you.All right. Thank you, Joe. Next up, we have Brian Conley.Good evening. Council members Brian Connolly here my business addresses 950 17th Street, Suite 1600. And as Joe mentioned, I am a land use lawyer with OT and Johnson Robinson, Neff and Reagan Eddie. I was asked by the applicant team to specifically touch on the issue of plant support, and we appreciate Mr. Shavers analysis on this topic.So I'll be brief. The proposal will allow for revitalization of an auto oriented, low density intersection and to a much more walkable area that takes advantage of transit access. So in that way, the proposal furthers many of the big picture themes of Blueprint in the Allman Lincoln Park neighborhood plan, including providing access to opportunity, creating affordable housing, establishing conditions to support community oriented businesses, provides mode shift away from cars and towards other forms of transportation, and it provides efficiency in land use and development. Since Brandon provided greater detail on planning guidance, I won't reiterate what's already been said, but we do believe the proposal is most appropriately reviewed under the urban center and neighborhood contextand that the future places guidance supports the building height at seven stories along Colfax and scaling down to the south. With respect to the comparison to the existing zoning, the rezoning advances several aspects of planning guidance and brings the property integrator conformance with the plans when compared to the existing zoning.The building height will remain the same as currently entitled in the CM x eight with waivers portion of the site and the zone change will allow for relief from the current are limitation, which makes for less site, less efficient site development and avoids the possibility for surface parking.It maintains protected district upper storey setbacks and reduces height in the CM x five portion of the property, and it will require activation through transparency and street level active uses. So with that, we believe the request is consistent with planning guidance.We agree with staff's analysis. We'd be happy to take questions or discuss this further. We certainly respectfully request your approval. Thank you.Thank you. Next up, we have Jay Fournier. Go ahead, J.Hi. My name is. My name is Jay Fournier. I'm also with the Opus Group. I am here to answer questions on the design architect on the project, working with Joe and Brian. I don't have anything formally to request but just offer my mind if you have any questions regarding the architectural design and the urban planning of theproject. Thank you.All right. Thank you, Jay. And our last speaker on this hearing is Jesse Paris.The new members of council cannot be heard.Mm, go ahead.My name is Jefferson Parish, a representative for Denver homicide. Wow. Blackstock, someone with the self defense, has a passion for social change, as well as the Unity Party of Colorado and Mile High Schools. And I will be the next mayor of Denver in 2023.I was with me not in approval of this rezoning. I figured it was going to be more gentrification than usual. This area town has been gentrified, such as other areas of town, the Westside as well. I wanted to know I had a few questions for the occupants.If. You are going to plan on keeping the existing restaurants and retail establishments along with the laundromat. I also wanted to know why only 10% of units are going to be affordable for 99 years. Also, we wanted to know why the army levels are so high since you're talking about affordability.Is this affordable for 60% to 80%? Army is not affordable. Especially when an average annual income in Denver is about $55,000 a year. So. I say that the occupiers did their research better outreach. They reached out to the Arnolds.They reached out to several neighborhood groups. I seen there was one letter of concern. I wanted to know what that letter of concern was. I want to know what the letter of opposition was. And also I want to know what is the guarantee of this actually being affordable.You said that you came out with a neighborhood a neighborhood agreement. Who is going to enforce this agreement for 99 years? And also how many portable units. Is it going to be more than 28? Or is that just the total that's going to be affordable?How many units in total are going to be at this property? And honestly, it's it's got to be next year. This is going to be residential commercial all the above. So a please answer those questions. I will greatly appreciate it.Thank you.All right. Thank you, Jesse. And that concludes our speakers questions from members of Council on Build 1086. Councilwoman Torres. Thank you, Madam President. Brandon, my first two questions are for you on the justifying circumstances. You mentioned that public and private investment along the Santa Fe corridor were one of the things that allowed this to go to higherheights or meet some of the criteria. Can you just give me a sample of what those investments were that qualified for you in your in your analysis?Yes, definitely. So staff looked at recent development that has occurred along Santa Fe since 2010 when the neighborhood plan was adopted. So I think in the application, they specifically call out a mixed use building that's under construction right now along Santa Fe.They also talked about another project that is at Colfax in Osage that just recently opened. And then the public improvements, I believe, are still underway. But there is a project underway by Daddy to make Santa Fe Corridor a quieter sidewalks and public art components to make it more of a walkable place.So I think that staff thought that increasing the height and the density at this location was in going with the neighborhood is changing and was a satisfying, justifying circumstance. Hey.The.Parking minimums here. Can you tell me a little bit more about how how you look at what kind of parking is required here, given either whatever arrangement is made, the type of zoning that it has and its proximity to transit infrastructure.Yep, that's a great question as well. I do not know off the top of my head what the parking requirements are for the C-Max and. It depends on if it's for residential or if it's for a commercial use.I can get back to you on that. And then there's also a parking reduction for being in close proximity to the rail station. So I believe that they.Did get a reduction.Yes.Okay. Thank you, Brendan. Andrew, question for you at Host.If you can give me a little bit more.Information in the in the public about the development agreement that was struck.Sure. We worked with the there's a voluntary, affordable housing agreement that has been struck on this property. It will be in place, as they've talked about it already for 99 years. It takes a total of the 280 units that are anticipated at this particular time and would say 10% of those would be creating 28 units.This is intended to be. There's a for sale clause and there's a rental clause. But the rental is will generate about 25 units at 80% AMI and about three units at 60% AMI. As we were going through the negotiating process, when we looked at the neighborhood and what we were looking for here was really also trying toget larger family units. So we were looking at things with like three bedrooms. We actually were able to come to an agreement that all of the three bedroom units in this project would be affordable. So there's we they did go the extra mile to actually get a larger family units in this in this agreement.So did you have any other questions?You mentioned a for sale clause. What does that mean for affordability?So it provides an option. So if you have a rental, if you if the project's all for rent, then it would be everything would be 80 and 60% AMI. But if they operate for sale, then it would be actually it's the same.It's 80. It's sorry. It's sometimes are different.Okay. Thank you. Thank you.Thank you, Andrea. And then my final questions are for the applicant, Joe or Brian. So several of the businesses in the retail area have closed. I've noticed recently, but I know the restaurant remains. There might be some others.Have you been has there been conversation with any of the businesses that have remained about continuing on with the project? What does that look like so far? I know.It's throwing a.Wrench and everything, but.Yeah, COVID has affected some of the local businesses there. Um, I know the Starbucks, um, the two other businesses are planning to leave. Um, and we worked actually hand in hand with the laundromat to kind of figure out how to relocate them.Um, so we've come to agreement with them. Um, part of our purchase agreement that doesn't allow us to speak with the tenants directly as we have, we've had to go through the landlord. But the project is designed where we can bring back these local tenants, um, and keep them in the project if necessary and if they wantto stay a part of our outreach engagement. Over the last 15 months, we met with Irene Aguilar and asked them through our programs to try and help out with a time in between when construction starts and when the building would be open for these retailers.And we hope this is committed to really help these tenants and act as a liaison between the tenants and to try to figure out a way to make that work.Okay.That's helpful. So Andrew gave a little bit of a rundown of the development agreement, and I remember in committee it was clarified that you can designate the affordable units for a certain population. I think my question was, how do you make sure that it's not students, that it really is families and not a set of roommates thatmight be occupying the three bedroom?How would that actually.Work in your in your.View?Sure. So, first of all, we're renting by the unit and not by the bed. And that is typically a natural deterrent to students. You know, they're looking for, you know, to rent a bed and not be held accountable for an entire unit.We also we rent on a 12 month rental cycle, and it's not based on the academic calendar. It's also my understanding that their housing policy allows us to cater towards that family, and that's what we intend to do.Okay. On the art curation, I know that you and I saw the letter from the district. Thank you for working with them. What does that look like? Does that look like art shown in the lobby or. I thought I remembered artist studios being discussed at one point.What's the what's the plan for this one?Yeah. So we have a few options. I think first off, we have an opportunity and the right of way on the sidewalks that have some type of sculptures and some type of, uh, a pedestal to really make this feel like a gateway to the art district on Santa Fe.We also have the opportunity to have the assistance from the district and art and are united spaces in the building. And I think the kind of the best option is on the east side of the projects are the proposed project along Kalama.We have a co-working space where it would be floor to ceiling glass and the idea would be like a first Friday. Or if there's some kind of event that the artist from Santa Fe is hosting, that we could have a gallery space there, that a local artist could have their work shown and leave it there for, youknow, 2 to 3 month period or whatever would be appropriate for that artist.Thank you so much. And then on the actual development that the build, one of the big pain points of this particular corridor has been the sidewalk along Colfax. And Councilman Hines might remember.When we were.First sworn in, a constituent from downtown who uses a wheelchair to get around, made sure that it was on both of our radar, that he can't use this this particular sidewalk, the utility infrastructure is directly in the middle of it.Can you give us a sense of what you envision that looking like for pedestrians, for for for access?So part of this site development plan process, we worked with the city and we're basically dedicating the first 20 feet between the building and Colfax Avenue as public right away. So that would be an extended sidewalk as well as a tree line.And then we are upgrading all the sidewalks along the Pan Alley map. And then another thing of note is that obviously we bring on an accessibility consultant to make sure not only the public right away is accessible, but also within the building.Great.Thank you. Those are my questions, Madam President. Thank you so much. All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Torres. Councilwoman Ortega.Thank you, Madam President. Joe, if you could just stay on. I've got a few questions for you as well. First of all, did you guys try to acquire the property to the south of the lodge?We did not.Okay. That has historically been city owned property. That's where the Community Development Agency used to be before it was CPD and now Dido. And I had asked our planning director some time ago about planning director, but our Dido director to look at that property and tell us what was the status of it, because it has been vacantfor years and years and years and it's an eyesore on our community and it would have been ideal to incorporate into the development. But so that's why I was asking the question whether or not you guys even looked at that, because it will continue to be an eyesore on your property once it's all said and done, ifit continues to remain vacant as it is today.Yeah, yeah. There's there's currently a single owner on the property that we're rezoning and we never consider that piece of land to the south. Yeah, it could have been a good opportunity, though. Yeah.It could be. But anyway, so my next question, some several of them were asked by Councilwoman Torres. As far as the it is, is this being done in partnership with new said or did you guys purchased the property from them?Sunnyside actually sold this property to the current owner, I think it was in 2005. Okay. The new set is no longer part of.Okay. Got it. All right. That's good to know. I guess it's. I don't know. I lost track of that back then. Didn't realize that happened. That Fargo. I want to know if you guys have done a traffic study and if that's going to warrant anything new or different with that many units being put on the property.And can you give us an idea of roughly based on the commercial square footage that you're looking at and the residential? How many cars will be on the site?Sure. So we haven't.Had a significant reduction because of its proximity to rail. But you're not going to build a project without some parking.Right. So the code requires us to have 0.75 stalls per unit. We're currently designing at that point nine stalls per unit with retail spaces as well. We haven't yet done a traffic study, but that would be a part of the site development plan process as we get into that further.We submitted our initial plans in October and we're expecting comments here hopefully in the next 2 to 3 weeks. And at that point, we'll have to engage in a traffic study in the current retail on the site, I think there's about 15,000 feet.And so we'll have 10,000 feet of traditional retail and then six live work units. And those are about 1500 square feet each.When you say traditional, you think in a restaurant, some of the neighborhood serving kinds of businesses.Yeah. So the way it's designed on the northeast corner, that could be a restaurant like a sit down restaurant and that's about 3000 feet. And then the Inland Retail to be able to pan kind of mid-block along Colfax.That's going to be very flexible where it could be a sit down restaurant or it could be some type of a drop off laundromat. Really could be anything.Okay, so have you all begun talking to see about whether or not you're going to be pursuing any kind of curb cut off of Colfax?We're actually going to be removing the existing curb cut, and that does require commitment, see done. Um, and so as soon as we get these initial comments back from the step process that will allow us to begin the civil designed documents to engage, see that and start that process just.So that typically you're not going to have a curb cut on Colfax, is that right? You're just going to have a calendar.We'll have one access point, lots of columns, one off of the pan, and then we also have an access point. Oh.So good. Okay.Okay. That's helpful to know. I appreciate that. Let me move through. I've got a few more, if you don't mind. Madam President. We already talked about the parking reduction number of parking spaces the city owned lot. Curb cut.Traffic study. I think. Can you tell us whether or not you're looking at securing any lower income tax credits for the project?Well, we are not. Yeah. The really the only benefit that we are looking for, this is the extra height in zoning. So it will not be asking for any other assistance.Okay. All right. Those are my questions. Thank you much.All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Next up, we have Councilman Hines.Thank you, Madam President. I wanted to thank Councilmember Torres for bringing up the point about access on Colfax. I also want to thank the applicant for, I think you said, 20 feet of right away. Wow. So I use a wheelchair for mobility.I add after customer returns brought up the lack of access. I have tweeted about that location to and from from where I live to go over the metro. I would go along this area and I would go in the in the in the parking lot because there was no way for me to get between the rock obstructionand the trees. And so I want to thank you for your commitment to pedestrian access. Colfax, obviously, is a huge transit corridor, perhaps the busiest in the city. I don't I don't know. I haven't looked at the data, but at least for pedestrians and and mixed use.So I want to thank you for for considering the pedestrian access in that and that large sidewalk access. I think that that will really help you with with encouraging people to to live, work and play there and and use whatever businesses in the immediate area.So I just wanted to throw that coming up. Thank you and thank you, councilmember attorneys for bringing that up. And thank you, Madam President.Thank you, Councilman Hines. The public hearing for Council Bill 20 Dash 1086 is closed. Councilmember Torres. Would you like to make any comments since it's in your council district? Thank you so much. This was your group was actually one of the first two that I met with about this particular property.So I know that you've been working on it for a very long time and appreciate.All of the.Measures that have been taken to make sure that different partners within that neighborhood felt really good about the project, that community members felt like it was reflective of llama Lincoln Park. And I hope I would love for that to continue, not just with the art district, but with that community.That's very much an established and historical Chicano neighborhood that's deeply reflected in the art and in the culture surrounding that. It's also.A.Highly mobile. And I love the access that you're granting, particularly at Colfax, as we were discussing. But also, I think the what I'm hoping will be the transparency of the building. I remember a hotel, small hotel, boutique hotel that I visited in Louisville, Kentucky, where their lobby is effectively a a a.Gallery.And an artist studio for the public. And it just made it a really unique space that you don't see too often, especially as you get into the downtown corridor. So I just want to thank all of the partners that have been involved in this and have done it so deeply.And I know this is a project that Susan Stanton was working on, and it was just really a pleasure to be able to to work with her for such a short period of time. And knowing that she had been involved and was involved when we first met, it did breathe an air of confidence of process into thisproject and I think that has shown through. And just thank you for all the work that you've done. And I'm looking forward to the build and I hope my fellow council members will join me in supporting it. Thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman. Up next, we have help from Sandoval.Thank you, Madam President. I just wanted to echo what Councilman Tory says. I was working in Councilwoman Montero's office in 2012, 2013, when we did the study, pedestrian study and access along Colfax there. And we had talked about the redevelopment of this site and here it is.Now, I'm a council person being able to vote on it, so it's pretty cool. And in season Stanton's memory, I remember being elected and she called me and talked to me about this site and how excited she was about it and the affordability and what were my thoughts about it.And um, even though she's not with us today, her legacy still lives on through all of these buildings. And I miss talking to her and going over things with her. And she would be sitting here with us tonight, surely proud of all the hard work that we need to do so in her honor and her memory.I thank you, Councilman, for bringing that up, because she's been it's been this degree of loss to the families community with through this year. With that, I will also be supporting it this evening. Thank you.All right. Thank you, Councilman Sandoval. And and thank you both for bringing up Susan's memory. She is definitely near and dear and had her networks all over the city, if not the region. And so I'm happy to support this tonight as it meets all of the criteria.Madam Secretary, roll call.For us.I.Well, I. Peter Baker. I. Ah.All right.When?I.Brendan.I.Time.I.I.Can I?Ortega, I.I. Sawyer.

I will move to pass the council. Bill 119826. Is there a second section? It's been moved and seconded to pass the bill. Councilmember Peterson, you are listed as the prime sponsor of the bill, so you are recognized in order to address this item.Thank you. Council President colleagues, this is Council Bill 119826. It's accepting 3.5 million essentially for the West Seattle Bridge. The money is from the Federal Surface Transportation Program and is going to our Seattle Department of Transportation. I'd like to thank Council President Gonzales and Durkan for their votes at the Puget Sound Regional Council a few weeks agoto prioritize these funds for the West Seattle Bridge.Thank you, Councilmember Peterson, for that description. Is there are there any additional comments on the bill? Councilmember Verbal, please.Thank you. I want to echo Councilmember Peterson's appreciation for both Madam President Gonzalez, his vote at APEC, as well as the mayors. Thanks as well to Councilmember Peterson for being the sponsor of this bill. Just want to provide a little bit more detail about the purpose of these funds.2 million of these funds are identified to conduct what I was calling a type, size and location study for the eventual replacement of the West Seattle Bridge. Does not mean that we've decided that that is the that is the direction that we are pursuing between the options of replace and repair.But it gets these funds in place to do that work so that if that decision is made, we have that information. The remaining 1.5 million of the grant award will be used to support specifically the transportation demand management programs that respond to the West Seattle Bridge closure and focus these programs on providing alternatives to single occupancy vehicletrips between West Seattle and downtown. Want to note for West Seattle residents that the Council Central Staff Memo notes specifically that the funds related to the type, size and location study allows start to explore replacement concepts such as rebuilding the bridge or an immersed tube tunnel.It further notes that it would be the basis for an environmental review of alternatives and developing cost estimates. There's a great deal of interest in West Seattle for what's called an immersed tube tunnel. It's not a it's not a board tunnel or drill tunnel.It's built offsite and basically dropped into the water. And so just want folks to know that Scott was forward thinking enough to include this concept as eligible for funds associated with the type, size and location study.Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Herbold, for those comments. Are there any other comments on the bill? Excellent. We will go ahead and move along. It was my pleasure to advocate alongside Mayor Durkan for these additional flexible dollars to look at the scope of work as described by Councilmembers Peterson and Herbold, and really appreciate this bill coming forwardso that we can begin this crucial infrastructure work. An analysis of infrastructure work for residents of West Seattle. But also it is. Again, I want to remind folks that West Bridge is critical to mobility for the entire region, including those who come, including for those folks who do not live in West Seattle.It is just so key to the region's strategies around mobility and so important for us to make sure that we address those issues from a broad perspective, not just because of the direct impact to West Seattle residents, but also to the impact in, for example, Councilmember Morales's district two that is adjacent to your district, Councilmember Herbold, butalso in addition to the people who just rely on the West Seattle Bridge to get to and from home, but who may not live in in West Seattle. So I'm really proud to be able to support this bill and to continue to support efforts at the regional level, to continue to advocate for additional dollars that might beavailable to us to to really get this replacement or repair done in the most expeditious way possible. If there are no other comments on the bill, I will go ahead and ask that the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the bill.Whereas I.Know this. Hi. Morales. I. Mesquita. I. Petersen.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nAnd we also use them for non housing, community development programs in projects for public services, economic development and public facilities and infrastructure. The program. First purpose is to develop a viable urban community, primarily for low and moderate income persons through decent housing, suitable living environment and economic opportunity.In the past five years, CDBG funded programs have served between seven and 8000 individuals per year. The city is required to prepare a five year strategic plan, which outlines a priority needs that will inform the CDBG funding decisions for the upcoming five year period.Also to receive CDBG funding. The city is required to submit to HUD an annual action plan detailing the program's activities and resources to address the housing and community development needs as outlined in the five year strategic plan. These will come before you in May of this year.In addition, there's priorities among the needs of the non housing, community development, social services, the Social Services and Human Relations Board. Shrub provides a refined priority statement to reflect the social services needs in the community, which is included as Exhibit one in your packet.This will be included as a part of the RFP that will be going out specifically for public services. And the RFP is tentatively scheduled to be released this Thursday pending your approval today. So in October of last year, we had an a community outreach meeting.In attendance was three housing authority staff members and 27 community members. Groups that were represented from the City Alameda Department was the Community Development Department, Public Works, Park and Rec and the Fire Department. In addition, there was the Commission on Disabilities, the Mastic Senior Center and Social Services Human Relations Board.Nonprofit providers such as the Food Bank, Building Futures, Family Violence Law, Eden Housing and Alameda Point Collaborative. And also residents. A summary of the discussion of the needs is included as exhibit two. Some of these needs included. Large scale collaboration grant writing for leveraging funds to fill the CDBG gaps.Services for elderly abuse and aging in place. Family Services. Homeless Services. Other housing services such as. Supportive Housing. Transitional housing of. Shelter for the chronically homeless and then economic development needs, such as facade improvements, business loans and job training.Business plans. Exhibit three of your packet includes all of the priority needs that will be included in the five year consolidated plan. Staff received. Staff received comments from the County Housing and Community Development Department and the County Home Consortium, which the city is a part of.So staff would like to make three edits and the original priority needs for affordable housing in order to be parallel with the county. Those three edits include the second point under affordable housing. Rather than reducing the household to sorry, we want to reduce the household from 128 AMI to 80% AMI.Also, we want to combine the third and fourth point to read as reduce housing discrimination, which will automatically cover all who are discriminated against fair housing and tenant landlord services. And we would like to add a point to assist low and moderate income first time homebuyers.So the the process for the needs starts with the Social Services and Human Relations Board, which is which has already happened. On November 20th, 2014, the Social Services Human Relations Board heard all the comments from our community outreach meeting, heard additional public comments at that meeting, and incorporated that into their needs statement, which is included in yourpacket. The second step is today the city council hears public comment and adopts the needs statements. And the third process for the needs will be that the RFP will be released based on all the priority needs. Exhibit four is scheduled to complete both a five year strategic plan and the annual action plan for the upcoming fiscal year20 1516. And that concludes my report. And I'm not sure if there's somebody here from Shrub to speak at Amir.I have a question. I have a question.Mm hmm.So one of your recommendations to be aligned with the county is to.Change.The target population of who are grantees. Support from 120% of I to 80% of am I. That would be the threshold. So we're looking for anyone who's we're looking for grantees. We're looking to fund grantees who support households who are at 80% or below of am I.So only for for the second point. The the original point said preserve existing affordable rental housing and ownership for households of below 120%. So we want to reduce that to 80. So for example, a family of four at 120%, they have to make 110,000.So we want to reduce that to 67,000.So basic. But the key thing is what we're really saying is we want to target our limited CDBG funds away from moderate income families, which is the definition of 80 to 100% of my low income and lower.Correct. It'll allow us to be more flexible.Yes. Thank you. Or do we need to do something? I think we need to do something at this time. Then I'll ask my question. That clock's actually a little bit so fast. Didn't 1029 according to my iPad. Did anyone else have clarifying questions on this right now?Well, I did, but you go ahead and do what you need to do. So at this point, I'll just go ahead and do it. We need four votes to consider additional items. Do we have. Does anyone want to move that?We do that. All those in favor. I oppose none. Motion carries. All right. So so my question then, I thank you for your report missing. I'm looking at the and by the way, all of the needs and everything you do and or address in these reports are so well needed.I just wish there was more money to go around, but I applaud you for trying to do the triage here. So I was looking at the exhibit two, which was the summary of the Community Outreach Workshop on October 22nd of 2014.And on page two, there is a discussion about housing and then public services and the homeless. And, and I don't disagree with anything that's on here. It's actually kind of heart rending to, says, domestic violence survivors, elder abuse, homeless shelter.But one of the categories that I don't see, although maybe it's can contain elsewhere in this report, is we hear a lot about young people who age out of the foster care system in the state because at 18 you've aged out of the foster care program.And yet for anyone who's raised children, you know that they do not magically become mature young adults at the age of 18 in a day. Is there anything within these proposals that would catch that group or is the county doing things?I think it would be under affordable housing and in public services. So we kept the categories in the parades a little bit vague to give us some flexibility to be more specific every year as things come up. So we'll revisit, for example, for public services.We definitely revisit the priorities every single year to see what's happening in our community. The needs are.Okay, thank you. And then on page three of that same summary, there was a line item about unsheltered and chronic homeless, including homeless veterans. And I had participated and so did the mayor. Before she was the mayor, she was on the school board.Then when do we do that? In the fall or the when we did the walk early in the morning to try to get a count of the homeless on our streets. And one of the things that we were told is that a larger percentage of homeless are homeless veterans.But I think I understand that the VA, the Veterans Administration has some programs because that was one of the referral sources for for us on the walk.Correct. So there they work with one of our service providers, but we're definitely going to be looking into how we can zone in to the extremely low and the chronically homeless, I think is one of the goals for the county as a whole.Right. Right. Okay. Thank you. All right. Any other comments.Request? Yes. I notice that in the groups represented from the city of Alameda, the Alameda Police Department is not mentioned. And I know and in the past they were quite participatory and as a service provider and they're often the first people who come into contact with a homeless person representing the city or are often called upon forservice and in some of the public housing units. So my request is that as you go through the process, that if they weren't present there, that you can integrate the service that they do provide in your implementation of of the of the services that are going to be funded by the grants.So we definitely look at that. When we go through the RFP and look at collaboration. So many of our service providers are actually working with the police department. So for example, Family Violence Law Center Building Features.Alameda Collaborative, selected the logos and all of them have a connection. There is interaction with the police and I'm hoping that there that they get a seat at the table as you go forward. Thank you.Yes, I was just going to add and in fact, it was the police department that that organized the walk that we went on. And I will shout out to a particular officer, Elisa Ledbetter. She's an amazing resource of of knowledge and in different services in our city and all over the county for various homeless and other otherfolks who were just out and down on their luck. And it's not always necessarily a crime, but as the vice mayor noted, that the police are often the first to encounter people in these situations. But, you know, they're definitely there.I don't know if their logo wasn't presented just because they weren't looking for anything.I just didn't have enough room yet. But we definitely work with them and I'll make sure they're at the table.And they are great. Thank you. I want to confirm you finished giving your presentation. All right. And we do not have any public speakers. This is the first part of this agenda item is a public hearing. There were no slips turned in.Wait a minute. One is coming up. It. So do I need to open the public hearing then, since we have a speaker now. So. Yeah. So I'm going to open the public hearing for this item. You may proceed.And then this.Well, and this, of course, I'm kind of in between. Hi. My name's Jennifer Bolan. Hi, Madam Mayor. And council members. I came from building opportunities and out of your homeless program and am in need of your disabled housing.So this pertains to me, but I currently live in a private housing program or I'm currently privately housed, so we need to maintain the other housing because I may end up back there. So part of the needs thing is to maintain.And when you're developing the rental thing is to have senior and disabled housing. Because I came out of building opportunities and I may end up needing the rental or ending up back on Alameda Point because when I can't afford the other housing, I'm going to need the senior and disabled housing.And that way I don't end up homeless and back on the streets here in Alameda. And because if you keep developing and I can't afford the other housing, I'm going to need the disabled housing. And if they raise that, the rate that you have to make so little money or too much money because I am on SSDIand I don't make a lot of money, but I'm. Too rich for Section eight, but too poor to make rent. So I'd appreciate if you could include those of us that make like $1,000 a month in this needs category.Because I'm 51 and I do go to Mastic and I do go to I came out of building futures and I really appreciate those programs. And, you know, if you keep funding Midway Shelter. Thank you.Thank you.I have a question. Yes. For us.This is our public hearing, though, right?You can close the public hearing, go to an.Audition if there's no more slips on it. I'm going to now close the public hearing on this idea. Thank you, everybody.Thank you, Madam Mayor. My interpretation, what the resident had just said, was that she is at a certain income that is above the 80% AMI because she cannot she is not eligible for Section eight in section eight, you know, certainly has its income triggers.So to the extent that she is not eligible for Section eight, that tells me that she's above that 80%. Am I? So the implications of what we're doing with regard to housing and change from changing the threshold from 120% of AMI, which is the top bracket for moderate to focusing just on 80% or below the implications ofthat are tweeters like her would be were would could be affected. So the question is. Is that altogether possible? You have a special continue with the transition from 120 to 80%, am I, as you're suggesting, but have a certain dispensation with regard to age?So whoever because age is a protected category and in special needs housing. So age. So if you're 55 and over and you and you're anywhere between 80 to 120%. Am I then that will be an exception to the.It's something to think about.So in the in the first point, it actually includes 30% AMI and 50% AMI for rental. But if we want to be more specific, you can make any of these points just a little bit more specific to prioritize seniors or.Anything that you want. But it does include 30% and 50% AMI for rental.Mm hmm.Oh, I know, but. But she wouldn't even be eligible for that because she's above 80%.She's the age was 51.All over.The age at this.We can be.What she was saying is, though, is she the way that she was framing it is. But she would like he might need it in the future, because the extent that she's 51 now, perhaps in four years and she's just one individual of it, perhaps is altogether illustrative of the dimensions that we need to look at this issue. So we can make it a more refined priority and add that we want to give priority to senior housing or whatever.I rely on.And when do we revisit this item? Would it be in a year from now? You you'd give us an update. This is an annual.So these are for the five years. And every year I come to you with the needs for that year in case we need to refine every year anything to be more specific to our needs.So can you keep track of people that are not included that reach out to you for help if we are whose needs we're meeting and who we need to? Really, maybe we do need to reevaluate that.Okay.That would be great. And then on this item.Madumere, just one more point. And the reason why I'm pushing this like I just did is because I think there has to be something said about someone taking the time to come to a public hearing to talk about this issue.And while I don't know if you know what she has to say is statistically representative of her income and age cohort, I do know that she took the time to come here tonight. So in that respect, I would hope that, you know, she and others see that this city council is trying our best.So this side and we had the public hearing, but we also need to my understanding, we need to approve.Approve the priority needs with the changes that I submitted.Yes, sir. Do we have a motion? So moved all those in favor. I, I oppose and motion carries. Thank you very.Much. Thank you.Next item is six H report from a.Report from the Almeida Rental Housing Community Discussion Group and request for the Council direction concerning various proposal.Thank you.

So do you want to a quick staff report on this? Craig back. Thank you, Mayor. Members City Council. We're excited to bring this item before you.I think many of you, if you haven't actually ridden one of the blue bikes, are very familiar with our bike share program. It's been a successful program. We have roughly 400 bikes deployed through primarily the downtown and coastline areas of the city.This request before you this evening would allow us to purchase probably in the in the order of 500 more bikes. And our next expansion would essentially take it up through Bixby Knolls in the north Long Beach following our bike boulevard routes.So we view the bike sharing, the Bike Boulevard project and expansion kind of going hand in hand. And so we're asking for council approval tonight to allow us to move forward with purchase from the vendor, which is S.O.B. bicycles.That concludes my staff report. Thank you. Thank you. Vice Mayor Richardson.Bike share shares coming uptown. That's it. Thank you.Councilmember Pierce.Yes. I am excited to see the bike share expanded. I did want to see. Are there any smaller bikes? I'm five one. I'm not even a kid. And it's really hard for me to ride those bikes. Do they have a smaller bike?Councilmember I'd be happy to show you how the seat.I know how the seat adjusts and when I adjusted all the way down, it's a challenge of it's a challenge for me. It might be a challenge for a junior high kid that wants to go on a ride with their parents.You know, all seriousness, we are actually working with a vendor for a couple of things. And what we would like to introduce into the system are tricycles as well.Not I don't want to try.Not not little people off of tricycles, but adult tricycles because some people have asked for something that's more stable and something with a basket. So we're looking at tricycles. We're also looking at e-bikes as well. So electric.Bikes.I will ask him something specific for.You know, people in between, you know. You know, he said tricycles. Yeah, adult tricycles. I like it. Okay. Thank you. Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember Supernanny. Thank you. I just spotted some e comments here. And I guess for the purpose of telling the audience that we read the comments even at 12:12 a.m.. But there is you know, I'm sorry, but it's the comment was no measure eight funds should be spent on these bicycle.So I think the confusion is Proposition eight versus Measure A. Mr. Beck, could you explain that, please? Yes, Councilmember, thanks for bringing that up. That is correct. We are not asking for approval to utilize Measure $8. Proposition $8 are transportation dollars that the city receives through its partnership with L.A. Metro, and they're targeted specifically for transportation projects. So it's really quite different from Measure A in that is, is it would you call it like a reimbursement or.What would it be called?The city receives a share of the Proposition $8, which again are transit oriented dollars that can only be spent on transit projects. Measure as you're very familiar as a tax the city receives, it is essentially general fund dollars.Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much, Councilwoman Gonzalez.Just really quickly, Craig, since we're on the issue of tricycles, thinking of our little ones. Councilmember Price had mentioned maybe a unicycle.I'm kidding. But actually I have thought about.Children or families with children like my own. And we often think of adding the little one and putting I don't know if the the addition for children. I don't know how we incorporate that, but I've seen that in other cities.So I don't know if we're even perusing that, but it'd be a really good one for us to add maybe down the line if we could, just throwing it out there. Thank you.Thank you, Counsel. Actually, Vice Mayor Richardson.But that break does bring up a good a good question. I know. Is it true that people under 18 can't do can't check on a bike? Is that true?So one of the things that we're looking at is modifying both our rules and our rate structure. Okay.

Councilors Braden and Barr call for the following resolution commemorating the 50th anniversary anniversary of the hotel burned on fire on June 17, 1972, and memorializing the lives of nine firefighters lost in the line of duty.The Chair recognizes counsel. Braden Counsel. Operator, you have the floor.Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to suspend the rule of 12 and add yourself. President Flynn as a third co-sponsor.Hearing no objections. The chair is added as the original 33rd co-sponsor.You know, I came to Boston and. Got involved with the McCarthy family, my partner's family. And there's a tradition in that family that when a fire fire and a fire truck goes by with all the alarms going. They say St Lawrence prays for them.And it's a reminder that firefighters rush in to danger, to save or save lives every, every day. On June 17th, 1972, after nearly 3 hours of fighting a massive blaze at the Hotel Vendome in 1660 Commonwealth IV in the Back Bay, part of the building collapsed, trapping 25 firefighters and claiming the lives of nine members, making thetragedy the largest line of duty, a death in the history of the Boston Fire Department. This Friday, we will be commemorating the 50th anniversary of that very tragic day and the loss of those firefighters. Yet. One of the nine members of the fire department whose lives were lost were fire new tenant Thomas J.Carroll of Engine 32. Fire to Tenant John E. Hanbury of Ladder 13. Firefighter Charles Donlan of Ladder 13. Firefighter Joe Sanok of Ladder 13. Firefighter John E Jamieson of Engine 22. Firefighter Thomas W Beckwith of Engine 32. Firefighter Paul J.Murphy of Engine 32. Firefighter Richard McGee of Engine 32. And firefighter Joseph Boettcher of Engine 22. The end. The tragedy of the Hotel Vendome fire exemplifies the risk, courage and self-sacrifice of the firefighting folks and the occupation of the firefighters in the performance of of the duty and service.I was and recently last fall, we had a we had a fire in our neighborhood. There was a lot of it was in the early morning hours of 1:00 or so. And we had a lot of fire alarms going off.And and we we got out of bed and we walked over and witnessed firsthand the incredible bravery and commitment of our firefighters as they rescued folks from a fire. One unfortunately, one young man died in the blaze. But this is sort of the daily work of our firefighters.It's also a reminder that firefighters, they rush into danger every day. We had the firefighter at the Vendome tragedy on June 17th, 1972, and in December of 1999. I was fairly new to the country, but there was tremendous tragedy, a hard, really difficult tragedy in Worcester when six firefighters died, when the building collapsed.And on September 11th, 343 firefighters died rushing into a building to save others. And I want to take this moment not only to recognize the sacrifices of the firefighters who fell on June 17, 1972, but all the other five firefighters who have died in the line of duty, and those also who are impacted by the pollution andthe distress and the pollution that they experienced just exposed to day to day and that everyday work. So I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution and honoring the fallen firefighters at the Vendome. Thank you.Thank you, counsel. Brady in the chair recognizes counsel. Counsel Bork, you have the floor.Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you to you and to counsel for co-sponsoring. Counsel has spoken about it at length. So I just want to say that these firefighters are still very heavily remembered in the Back Bay, and I'm glad that our predecessors were able to support a memorial to them 25 years ago.But, you know, that day that we lost these nine men, we also, you know, 25 kids lost their father. And those kids are still alive today and they've been bearing that loss for 50 years. So I think it's it's neat and proper that the city should continue to recognize this.And I do want to ask the councilor for District eight, invite all colleagues who can make it on Friday at 11 a.m. will be at the memorial at the corner of Commonwealth and Dartmouth marking this anniversary. So anybody who can come I know we would love to have you there.And and just the one other thing I want to say is that, you know, in the aftermath of the fire, there was a whole study. And what they found was that a structurally inappropriate modification had been made to the building actually several decades prior.That was the reason for this sudden collapse of the five floors. So I just want to emphasize that for a lot of us as counselors, we encounter the fire codes when we have constituents calling, complaining about the fact that they're building project as being hung up on the fact that the fire department still needs to do isdue diligence. And I just think that the Vendome fire is a really important example of why we have those important structural safety rules in place. So I just want to want to add my condolences to the families who still feel this loss 50 years later and support for all of our firefighters who do this dangerous work.Thank you, Mr. Chair.Thank you. The chair now recognizes Council President Flynn as President Flynn, the floor is yours.Thank you, Counselor Arroyo. And thank you to counsel and counsel Braden for adding me on as an original co-sponsor. I just wanted to highlight the sacrifices of these firefighters, but also their families as well of the service and the sacrifices their families made for our city.And for our country. Over the weekend, we were at Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain with many members of the Boston Fire Fire Department, and some of them are here now from local local 718. There was firefighter Firefighter Memorial Sunday, and we came together as a city to pray for the families of the fallen firefighters.But we also resolved, as elected officials coming into the state house, coming into city hall, to do everything we can to support firefighters, to support their families on so many issues and challenges a firefighter faces every day. So and I think Councilor Braeden mentioned a couple of them, the various health related issues that firefighters and their familiesare subjected to because of the dangerous job that they do. So I'm just I'm just honored to be here and to be part of this be part of this resolution. Thank you, Councilor Braden. Thank you. Council BLOCK But also to make all of my councilors who have been strong supporters of the Boston Fire Department, including former staterepresentative Michael Flaherty, Council fired his father, who really led the charge up at the state house in support of firefighters across across the state. Thank you, council.Thank you. Council President Flynn recognized Councilor Murphy. Council member you have the floor.Thank you. Arroyo So I'm standing in full support of commemorating the Hotel Vendome fire. And I want to thank you, Councilor Brady and Councilor Bach and also Councilor Flynn, for filing this resolution. As we know, it takes a lot of courage and dedication to enter a burning building when others we know are trying to run out inthe opposite direction. And it also requires training, skill, caring and discipline to rescue and tend to a victim of a fire or an accident in the midst of confusion and danger. Last month I visited Moon Island with the recruit class and saw them in the midst of their training and knowing.They have to put a lot of effort in to make sure that when they're on the job out there protecting us, that they're ready for that. So I stand with our councilors today to express our deepest condolences to those families whose loved ones were lost in service and to highlight the risk, courage and sacrifice of all ofour firefighters in the city of Boston who protect and serve our residents every day. And Councilor Flynn mentioned and I know I was there, along with Councilor Florida and Councilor Lujan for the Young and Mayor Woo at the firefighter mass last weekend, which was beautiful.But when they handed out all those flowers and you saw how many firefighters we have lost and families that also put their lives on the risk, they're just sacrifice also. So I just want to thank our firefighters and thank you to the sponsors of this.Thank you, Councilor Murphy. And I recognize Councilor, I mean, here you have the full resources.Thank you. Vice-Chair I just wanted to thank the makers for bringing this resolution to the floor. And I just have to say, you know, I, my first term was focused on it and I didn't really get an opportunity to build a relationship or to learn about our front line workers and the dedication that and the risk thatthey put their lives in every single day. And I just want to just say thank you for not just answering the call of duty. I've gotten to know a lot of your members over the last year or so, and just just the social, emotional and traumatic impact that a lot of the families face when they see theirloved ones going off to duty and not knowing whether or not they're going to come back. And so I just want to rise in support of this resolution and and to send my sincere condolences to the family. I know that you have a fighter in me, even though I'm always fighting a job, you know, lots of love. And thank you so much to my council colleagues for filing this resolution. Thank you. Calls my name.Thank you, Councilor. Me here and I recognize councilor who?Yes, thank you. Thank you to Councilor Braeden for this resolution. I just want to echo what Councilor Murphy had said. We attended a beautiful, somber ceremony this past Sunday, really recognizing acknowledging the sacrifice made by the firefighters who have lost their life when trying to save others.So I think the firefighters of this city, I think the families I think Councilor express it really well, like 25 children. Without parents as a result of the hotel band on fire. So I want to take a moment to acknowledge that as as as part of our history here in the city of Boston and want to thankthose who.Are.Who choose to enter this profession, which requires a great amount of sacrifice. So thank you to the makers in commemorating this moment of the Hotel Vendome fire and to the city for the memorial to firefighters that we had on Sunday.Thank you.Thank you, counselor.

It does say that they were having trouble finding a location the size of just a gunshot, but I am confident that it must be possible to find an appropriately sized location for the gun shop orjust a gun shop somewhere in Seattle. As I've said, the sweeps of homeless encampments are inhumane and ineffective.

Councilman Espinosa, please put 15 on the floor.And move the council bill. 15 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.All right. It has been moved in. Second it. The public hearing for council bill 15 is now open. Andrew, can we have a high level staff report of what you have in front of you? Thank you.Thank you. Good evening, Mr. President. Council members. So what you've already voted on tonight in terms of map amendments is a map amendment that establishes the incentive, height and river north design overlays on properties that already have mixed use zoning.This application aims to address some of the properties that don't currently have a height based, mixed use based zoning in this area. Essentially, as you'll see, it'll fill in some of the holes in the zoning map that you've already reviewed this evening, which is, of course, in Council District nine and spans four neighborhoods.This particular rezoning focuses on the area where the incentive height overlay is intended to apply, which is shown here in blue, and you'll see that shape show up on several maps here. Further through the presentation, this map shows this rezoning relationship to the larger river north overlay the design overlay boundaries shown there in red.And this map shows the actual rezonings proposed as part of this proposal. So this is this proposal would rezone properties with a mix of C-Max and IMAX zoned districts with three, five and eight storey maximum heights that sync with the incentive height overlay system that you've already heard about and discussed this evening.And it affects properties that currently have non height based zoned districts like I.B. in a in some former Chapter 59 zoning. It does not affect properties with custom zoning, such as some of the pods that already exist in the area and some former Chapter 59 zoning with waivers.As I've already explained, existing zoning in this area is is a mix of industrial, commercial and mixed use. Zoning land uses reflect that that varied mix of zoning and uses lots of industrial mixed with commercial and residential in this area.This image shows the southwestern half of the incentive height overlay area gives you a feel for the scale of.Development.There. This is the end of the development of the area is a mix of of newer residential with some industrial uses. This aerial shows the the other in the. Northeastern half of the project area. And you can see that this is this area is characterized by heavier industrial uses.These images show some examples of existing and and recent development in the area. As I mentioned up front, this is proposing a mix of IMX and CMA zone districts. The CMA Zone District is appropriate for urban centers and transit oriented development promotes an active industry in realms with a mix of uses.In this particular application, it's proposed where a preponderance of adopted land use recommendations are for transit oriented development, mixed use, or something similar to that, and where existing land uses are primarily residential and commercial. The IMX zone districts are proposed where existing land uses are industrial or residential, and this is a district that promotes pedestrian scale, mixeduse development similar to CMCs with an active street level, but also permits many industrial uses that currently exist similar to how they're regulated in the IB and air zone. So it's appropriate for areas that are transitioning from industrial to more of a mix of uses.Abe already covered the the extensive public process for this. I won't go into much detail here, but I did want to highlight that during the discussion of this base rezoning, we did two mailed notices and held two meetings specifically for property owners interested in learning.More about this proposed.Rezoning. There are about 20 registered neighborhood organizations that follow whose boundaries include properties proposed as part of this rezoning. All have been notified and you've already heard from quite a few of them this evening. With regard to the criteria, as you know, for a legislative rezoning, the Council must find that these three criteria have been met withregard to adopted plans besides the comprehensive planning blueprint. Denver There are about five small area plans that impact properties in this area, and I'll walk through that, an overview of those policies here shortly. This proposal would implement comprehensive plan policies, generally speaking, to redevelopment or in development in areas near transit stations with a mix of uses andpedestrian friendly environment. The Blueprint Plan calls for a mix of transit oriented development, a mixed use, industrial and employment mixed uses in this area, reflecting some of the the small area plans in this area as well. The station area served, of course, by a network of mixed use streets and high quality bus and commuter rail access appropriatefor transit oriented development. This is the the the area plan that kind of brought together all of the kind of reconciled all of the height recommendations from the many area plans impacting properties in this area while carrying forward their their height recommendations.This is the 2016 and 38th and Blake Height amendments and this is essentially the core policy from which this incentive program was was created as has already been explained several times. The the base heights are shown there in numbers and then the proposed incentive heights, the allowable instead of heights are shown in Color River North Plan establishedrecommended a mix of transit oriented industrial mixed use and commercial mixed use for this area 30th and Blake Station area plan also recommended a mix of transit oriented development or tree core closest to the station with residential and employment mixed use.As you get closer or further away from the station, the Elyria and Swansea Neighborhood Plan recommended a mix of of transit oriented development, industrial mixed use and then general mixed use in the area. With regard to the other criteria, this request is consistent with the requirement that the request result in the uniform application of district regulations thatwill result in the uniform application of the CMCs and Impact Zone districts. And finally, this request will implement further public health, safety and welfare by implementing many adopted plans in the area for walkable development and mixed uses near high quality transit.So with that, CPD recommends approval of this base rezoning, and I'm happy to answer any questions.Andrew, we're all proud of you. Well done. Thank you. I have good news and even better news. We have two speakers this evening and they have both left. So questions by members of council. Do we have any question, Councilwoman Ortega.I'd like to ask whether or not this creates any nonconforming uses. So, for example, we have marijuana growers allowed in the industrial zones. And I'd like to know if this creates nonconforming uses within. With with the zone change.I believe that for some existing uses it might create some compliant uses. So those uses that may no longer be permitted in a new zone district would be allowed to continue as long as they as long as they do.But once they're those uses are ceased.There may be some uses that that are no longer permitted.Okay. And then I would like to know if part of the discussion with these specific boundaries, which abut the Globeville rail yards, included any conversation about buffering or complying with the new the new policy that, you know, when folks come in and want to develop, they've got to now check the box and be able to address howthey're going to deal with that issue.This particular rezoning does not directly address that issue, but any any single development that comes in and goes through the site planning approval process would that that is the point at which those types of issues would be addressed.Okay.Thank you.Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Flynn.Thank you, Mr. President. Andrew, could you explain the parcels that are in the opt out and what of what's happening with those? They are we are not rezoning those parcels. We did put we did put the overlay, the two overlays on them.Councilman Flynn Actually, the the properties that requested to be opted out will retain their existing base zoning. So the, if they do not have a mixed use zoning today, the overlays will not apply. In some cases they may have lower intensity or they may have.IMX versus the proposed.CMCs. In those cases, the overlays will apply if the existing base zoning is a mixed use zoned district. However, those properties that opted to keep iby or if zoning overlays will not apply. And those are shown on the slide that I just pulled up here.Okay. Thank you. That's all.Okay. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Seeing no other questions. Public hearing for Council Bill 15 is now closed. Comments by members of council. You know, I'll just say I didn't get a chance to say too much about Andrew and his work in this sort of new to the CPD team and getting thrown into one of the most complexprojects and rezoning. Some of these based on districts where people don't understand about this whole project is that we had to bring it into compliance of of what the plans that you guys voted on 12th September 2016 were like.So thank you. It was not easy work. A lot of confused folks. But I got a chance to talk to two homeowners in the Cole neighborhood who really appreciated the outreach and how you took the complexities of this issue.I made a very simple so really appreciate your work and just want to say to everyone who's still standing, scratch that sitting in those chairs. Thank you so much for being a part of this, no matter what your view was, no matter what your.We really appreciate you being engaged this way. Excited, too. This is. One tool. Of 700 that we're working on, you know, and so really appreciate you guys.Councilman Espinosa Yeah, I'm both grateful that surprised that there are no speakers because more than anything, we just passed. To me, the reason why I'll be voting no on this is that this is that this is the the gentrification problem.This is the the displacement problem. This wholesale rezoning. Lifting the base of these properties is that lost opportunity that I was just speaking to on my prior comments, which is the incentive overlay could be applied to the existing zoning as it is.And that delta between this new base and what is entitlement today could also then be captured as incentive and get to those deeper assets that we are talking about. It is the fact that we have such liberal base zone districts that create the problem that we have in trying to leverage value capture to get better outcomes.Because, you know, and we have tools in the zoning code to address all of those things, but then that takes other resources, general fund resources, dedication of staff in time. And so for ten years now for yeah well for eight years that we've had the zoning code, the only places aside from this that have gone through overlays. Honey did it by themselves for five years. Yeah. Curtis Park. All the tools of zoning really take community resources. Councilman Cashman had the Christina Park again. Community led efforts to try and address all the other conditions that are wrought by this base, very generous base zoning.And so it is frustrating for me that we we would choose we already have plans that support this these sorts of changes. We now have the incentive overlay we should have we should have used these tools to sort of compel a sort of better outcomes in this area.We're going to get outcomes regardless of whether we did it or not. But we could have been more comprehensive in a more holistic in that approach. You've heard the concerns in the prior issue about the the sort of weakness of the tools, the the discrepancy between needs and what we're doing.And it's just it really bothers me that this is being pursued and it's in again, I'm surprised because this is more than anything, you know, the redevelopment opportunity was here. The incentive was the real. The incentive was the to pedestrian crossings.The incentive is all the infrastructure that we're putting into this area, the incentives is the Brighton Boulevard improvements. The incentive is the National Western Center is an incentive is the align. You know, development was going to occur here so it wasn't the height.But now we just raised the base about around a whole bunch of properties and and you know, so I'm going to I'm done talking. Let's go our evening. But that is to me, this is the missed opportunity in this whole thing.And and this is what's going to result in rapid displacement of the entire area and a real transformative character going forward. Thanks.All right, Councilwoman Ortega.Mr. President, I believe that the Salvation Army is within these boundaries. Correct?Let's see here. You know what I know. Yes, it is. Yep.Okay. So, Brad, this is an opportunity where we have a nonprofit that actually owns our own land in this area that wants to rebuild. And and I'm hoping that they will be given the same consideration as they move forward and want to rebuild and put a brand new facility there that we're giving to all the other developersthat are that are building in this area. And this would be an opportunity where we would see truly affordable housing in a development that will look totally unlike what it looks like today, that will serve people in a completely different way.And they will have to go through a separate reason application process. If this passes tonight, I don't know how many other nonprofits actually own land in this area. I know that we're still trying to do our hardest housing in this area.Correct. And I think that's moving along so that that will be another attractive development for this site that is trying to help keep artists in this area. I mean, you know, we saw this same thing happen to lower downtown.You know, this was an artist community. And once we started seeing the investment and people wanting to go in and build these build out the historic buildings in lower downtown. And, you know, we did have a $750,000 revolving loan fund to assist some of them with their, you know, gap financing and whatnot.But in that area, they got pushed out. They couldn't afford to stay. You know, my hope is this one project helps some of those folks. We think to some degree, the ordinance that we passed and the funding to assist the DIY folks is helping until their particular buildings are developed.But, you know, that's a short term gap in in helping those folks. But. I am hopeful that we can get there with Salvation Army being able to to do what they want to do on that site. And, you know, this is a case where we will prioritize people over project.So thank you.I thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. See no other comments.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nAll right. Thank you. Thank you for coming through. All right. We have one less proclamation. Typically, we only do have a limit of three. But we thought this is important and timely. So, Councilwoman Black, please read the proclamation.Thank you, Mr. President. This one is very short and to the point. Proclamation number 17 dash 1011. Recognizing the importance of DOCA and Dreamers to Denver, Colorado and the United States. WHEREAS Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DOCA has allowed more than 17,000 young Coloradans who have lived in the United States since their childhood to live, goto school and work legally in the country. And. Whereas, nearly 800,000 young people across the nation are better able to contribute to their families and communities because of the protections instituted through DOCA. And. Whereas, ending DOCA will cost Colorado more than 856.9 million in annual GDP losses and will remove an estimated 685,000 workers from the United Statesworkforce, resulting in a loss of 460.3 billion from the national GDP over the next decade. And. Whereas, our Senators, Michael Bennet and Cory Gardner have agreed to be co-sponsors of the bipartisan DREAM Act that would provide certainty for law abiding Dreamers.And. WHEREAS, 78% of American voters support giving Dreamers a legitimate pathway to citizenship and permanent, permanent residence in the country. Now, therefore, be it proclaimed by the Council of the City and County of Denver, Section one, that the Denver City Council calls on Congress to use the next six months to craft a bill that reflects the desiresof the majority of American people by providing a permanent, positive solution to the status of Dreamers. Individuals who are brought to this country as children have grown up in America and are contributing members to our society. Section two that the Clerk of the city and County of Denver shall attest and affix the seal of the city andcounty of Denver to this proclamation.Your motion to adopt.I move the proclamation. 1011 be adopted.It has been moved in. Second comments.Councilwoman Black This proclamation is probably the easiest one I've ever done and probably got the most enthusiastic support from this council. There's no doubt in my mind or anyone up here that these young people, these dreamers who go to school, work, pay taxes to serve in our military and contribute to our country, should absolutely get legal status. I'm happy to emphatically proclaim that to our national leaders, including our senators, Congress and executive. Now is the time for our national government to do the right thing and pass substantive legislation providing a realistic path to citizenship for our Dreamers.Thank you, Councilwoman Black. Councilman Kathryn.Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman Black, for bringing this forward. I was honored earlier last winter to help Councilwoman Gilmore craft a resolution in support of our immigrant refugee community, which was supported unanimously by this council.And now, once again, the need has come forth for this council to state its disagreement with the policies coming from Washington in this area of of guidance and state our support for those in our city that generally are unable to speak loudly enough for themselves.I agree wholeheartedly that we need legislation, this executive policy, Dacca needs to be firmly entrenched in legislation and we need to craft a path to citizenship for those in our country who are not so documented. But I really don't think that there was a need to threaten the security of thousands and thousands of our young people inorder to encourage Congress to act in a more permanent direction. So thank you again for bringing this forward. And I'd like to just take a quick second. And I have a group of students here from South High School.Esmeralda, Beltran, Chavez and several of her student allies. If you all would stand up and be recognized. Thank you for coming, troops. And as we will be having an opportunity to speak to you in just a minute, and I will guarantee you it takes this out of a as he story takes this out of a matter ofpolicy to a simple matter of human rights. So thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilman Cashman, and welcome. South High. This is your this is your house. You're always welcome here. Don't be bothered by the man in the back, John Zogby, on. He's just encouraging you on. All right, Councilman Espinosa, firstly, I just wanted to add my name to the proclamation and then just quite simply say another message toto to my state representative, who I spoke about last week, Cory Gardner and Michael Bennett. This is low hanging fruit. If you guys cannot come together and get this thing right in six months, you have no business being in office.I'm sorry. So I just want to implore Congress to do the right thing and and address this measure. Because if you're putting yourselves over the thousands of lives that are being affected by this, then you're not representing the people of this country.Thanks. All right. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Lopez.Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to thank you, Councilman Black, for for presenting this proclamation here in front of us. I know this is a unanimous vote, and it's because it's a no brainer. And it doesn't just happen on the federal level, happens on the state level.It did and it will happen on the local level. We have every single one of us, whether we're elected or not, has the the duty to stand for another person, to stand up for the rights of another person, and especially our young people who are criminalized.I stand unequivocally with our dreamers in this city and throughout our country. You know, I think it's a an immoral and unconscionable decision that was made by President Trump, by folks who could not pass the DREAM Act. But 20 years ago, the folks who could not continue to pass it, as are Dreamers, are now adults.And just a little bit of data on on those. According to that, there was a poll that was done well, not just a poll, but there was a source with DHS, the Department of Homeland Security's numbers, the University of California survey, political survey, and also that was reported in USA Today that the average age of and here'sa little bit of characteristics of who these dreamers are, right? 787,580, to be exact. And in Denver, we have our share. In this day. We have our share. Average age is about 25 years old. Right. 97 are employed or in school.97%. 91% have a job. 45% of those dreamers are in high school or college. Less than point less than 0.5% were in violation of their agreement of their of their status and or were deported. So a lot of folks that are out there that try to scare you and say that they say otherwise, it's just absolutely nottrue. And 78% of Americans believe that doc recipients should stay in this country, should have that path forward, and not to be a second class citizen. Let me just make this clear. It's one thing to be to have status.It's another when you have status without a pathway to citizenship. And so as we ask for that and as we as we tell our representatives how we act, when we act, each and every single one of us, we cannot just say, okay, we want a bill that allows folks to stay.We want a bill that allows folks to be citizens to have a pathway to citizenship without having to go to the military and dodge bullets in order to do it. Right. We have to have that path to citizenship.So as we look at at this DREAM Act, as we look at this new legislation, should it come, it's not for a second class status. It is for citizenship. Right. So with that, I just I just wanted to thank you, Councilwoman, for bringing this proclamation forward and L.A..Thank you. Thank you for being here. And thank you for having the backs of our students student center in our country, no matter what language they speak and no matter where they're from.Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilman Flynn.Thank you, Mr. President. For the least. The last 25 years. It has been the failure of Congress to address immigration. That has led us to the point where we are. People who were brought here as children who know no other country.Need to have a path. To citizenship, to stay here, to live the only life they've known to be the contributing members of U.S. society, that many of them already are, but without status. President Trump. If he's proven anything, he's proven to be predictably unpredictable.And by ending by announcing the end of this program, but giving it six months. And asking Congress to finally tackle their responsibility that they've avoided for a quarter century, I think has been he's sort of been very cagey about it.I think that he is forcing Congress's hand. And I think what we've seen since the announcement is, Mr. President, we've seen a bipartisan effort, Senator Gardner and Senator Bennet here in Colorado. In fact, we've seen a bipartisan effort and a commitment to ironing this out in favor of.The Docker program individuals. So I think that we I think we might see things we aren't right now expecting. Six months from now by forcing Congress's hand. And I think it's about time that that someone did that. And I think the president took it on as his own responsibility to do that.So with that, I won't be supporting this proclamation tonight and looking forward to sitting here six months from now and seeing a favorable resolution. Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Ortega.Thank you, Mr. President. I'll be brief. When President Trump started talking about his approach to immigration, his focus was on criminals. So why now is he targeting our children? President Trump, leave our children alone. Thank you.All.Hey, man. Thank you. Aw, come on. Guzman-Lopez.Yeah, I.Forgot to say one thing. You know. All kidding. With our. With our sports aside. There's someone here I want to take my hats off to. And you could take your hat off if you want to at this one.And that's President Franco, right? CSU, you know, CSU came out ahead of everybody and said, you leave our kids alone. They said, they will. They will step up to the plate. Metrowest stood up to the plate. I see you standing up to the plate.You said it is incumbent upon our institutions to stand up to the plate, to stand up for these children. And I just wanted to thank you, sir, for your leadership on that issue and for CSU coming out so strong on doing that.So hats off. Thank you.All right. Thank you. Okay. Seeing no other comments, Madam Secretary. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.Did he just tell Councilman Clark he could take his hat off? No, not everybody else. I'm so sorry.Madam Secretary. Please. Real call quickly.Black Eye.Clark. Hi, Espinosa.I flynn. All right.Herndon, I. All right. Cashman. Hi. Lopez. Ortega. Sussman. Hi, Mr. President.I police close voting, announce the results.One is missing.No. Oh, yeah, we are missing.Mr. President, as me. But my screen says.I'm marked as absent.Okay, you got it.We got you. Thank you. Councilman Herndon. Ten Eyes. Proclamation 1011 has been adopted. Councilwoman Black, Councilman Castro, and anyone you guys want to bring up.Yeah, we would like to ask two young dreamers up to the podium. The first is Esmeralda, Tierra Chavez, who Councilman Cashman already introduced. Please come up and come to the podium. She's a student in House South High School.And I'd also like to invite Hazel Munoz. Come on up. Hazel's is a family friend. I have known him for more than a decade. I have seen him grown, grow from a young teen to a very accomplished man.I have seen him balance risks and rewards as he has worked very, very hard. He's excelled at school against a lot of odds and in sports. Today he has an MBA from CSU Pueblo and works as a financial analyst.He's also a very kind and generous person and a good friend, and he contributes to our society in many positive ways. So I would like both of you to say a few words, please. As a.Ladies first. Ladies first.I would warmly like to thank Mr. Cashman for inviting me here today on behalf of myself high school. And if it is okay with Mr. President, I would like to say a speech I wrote myself, and I am sorry if it takes a bit, but I want to make sure that I get my message across as themembers of the city council.Go ahead.Okay. I'm sorry. This is the first time I've done something like this, so I'm kind of nervous. But I shouldn't be, because I should be proud of. Who I am today? I guess so. Hello, everyone. My name is Gerard Chavez, but you can call me A-Z.I am here today on behalf of South High School to speak of a worldwide issue that has culminated our nation. The date September 5th, 2017 will forever be remembered as the day the President of the United States said no to our dreamers, no to our dreams, no to our aspirations, and no to our hope.As a recipient. I am here today to make my voice be heard. I know most of you sitting in the crowd are here to listen to a story. A story of how I crossed the border, how I overcame my struggles.But you want to know something? My story is no different compared to any other story. You will hear from any of the 800,000 Dreamers we have present here today. All of us came with a purpose to reach the American dream.But let me ask you something. What is the American dream? For all of us, it is different. For some, it might be economic prosperity. For others, it might be the ability to gain the materialistic objects we have always wanted.Like a new car, a new house and whatnot. Globally. We have all been engraved in our minds that the American dream is opportunity for prosperity and success. But what good does this definition serve us if we sit on the wings of the people who cross borders, who cross seas across mountains, to come to a country where theyare offered these opportunities? So does this mean that the American dream will only pertain to those born in the United States? Well, let me tell you something. We are a country of immigrants. We are all immigrants. We all immigrated to different countries, different continents.Why? To search for a better life, a better education. And most of all, to search for our dreams. Crossing the border for me was not only crossing the border between Mexico and the United States, it was also crossing the mental border inside of me as undocumented immigrants.All of us knew the consequences of coming to a country where one single piece of paper was the difference between you and me. Reassured ourselves that we would hide in the shadows, that we would hide under the words of the people that judge us day and night.It took me a long time to find my voice. But by the help of a friend of mine, Ethan McNamee, whom we rest in peace, I find the voice inside of me. I found my courage. And more or less, I found my pride.I am proud to be an immigrant, and I am proud to be the person I am today. I built my own wings. I built my own path. And by the hope and support of my family. I built my own dream.Martin Luther King Jr once said, I have a dream that one day my four little children will one day live in a nation will they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.I cannot change the color of my skin. I cannot change the way my story was written. But, uh, sorry, but, uh. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Oh, I lost my path. But I belong to two cultures and I belong to two countries.And look, he made it clear that our culture does not define us, but that our actions and our words are the ones that speak louder than any bullet we let loose. As a captain of both the varsity soccer and cross-country teams.One of the things that we constantly talk about is resiliency. And it means showing toughness, toughness in life's most difficult moments. All my life, I've been a constant battle with the obstacles that life has thrown at me. I have struggled with my insecurities, with my decisions, and with my own self-doubt.It is easy to give up and quit when it gets too tough and when it seems like nothing will get better. But I chose to do the unexpected. I chose to rise up and fight the social inequalities. I chose to fight against the racial segregation we see constantly in the news, the radio and the television.I choose when to find my own battles and my victories are the ones that define me. I have accomplished so much and no one will take my achievements away from me. I have been named defensive MVP for my varsity soccer team two years now.I have been named the team MVP for two consecutive years for my varsity cross country team. I have been in the Student Athlete of the Week five times in my high school. I have been in the Mile High School Player of the Year.I have created my own leadership projects to help out our community and so much more. All those things. All those things don't come easy. They come with sacrifice. And now, coming into my senior year, I will be one of the two members of my family, including my cousin Yasmin, who lives in Mexico to graduate from high schooland go to college. I will be on the run for a full ride scholarship to play soccer at Njcaa D1 College. And I am one. And I know that one day I will be a physical therapist and no one and nothing will stop me from accomplishing my dreams.When I heard about the news on the television and I heard that Dhaka was at risk of being repealed, I was sad. I was overwhelmed. And more or less I was scared. I felt like once again, my future was in jeopardy.And no words can describe that feeling of desperation, anger and frustration of once again being one step behind. I cried, and I felt like that was my only way of letting out the anger. And after talking to one of my teachers, Mr. Marini, who has been a vital part of my success, I came home and I thoughtto myself, What will crying do? What will every year bring me? Every tear served as a reassurance that hopefully something good will come out of this. But I was tired. Tired of depending on people to make decisions for me.Tired of people that. Tired of people determining my future. And it was at that moment when I told myself. No more will I sit in the shadows. Hiding from society. Hiding because of fear. And no more will I hide the hide behind the words of the people that constantly bring us down.I am here to fight and I'm here to stay because no one because no more will let my voice be unheard. And no more will I let this one. And no more will I stand the stereotypes that feel like bullets hitting my chest.I will stand up, use my voice, which is the most powerful weapon any person can have. And I will fight for the people that, just like me, have dreams. On Friday at my school held the Dakar rally and I had the pleasure of telling my story to my peers.At that very moment, I felt appreciated. I felt loved. And I felt pride. Pride because I had the courage to tell others a part of me that I didn't feel worthy of saying. And as I looked around and saw people's faces, one thing I noticed was a different people present people with different backgrounds, with different stories fordifferent cultures. And here we were, all standing together, transpiring, love, support and hope. The US is enriched with many different cultures and as a nation we should appreciate when no other country has. And that is opportunity of learning is speaking to people all over the world, all in one place.We are a living kaleidoscope. My sister, who was born in the United States, came home that day and was confused, confused, confused because she didn't know what to call herself anymore. She asked my dad, But am I an immigrant?Think about it for a second and ask yourself, am I an immigrant? From my perspective, we are all immigrants because from the moment you choose, you choose to cross the street, to cross the city, to cross a country, to cross the border.In order to chase your dreams, you become an immigrant. Thank you very much for giving me the time to speak and for giving me the opportunity to stand up. And I would formally like to in my speech by saying to Attorney General Jeff Sessions that we are not illegal aliens.We are human beings. We are the future of this country. And we are dreamers. Now.Wow. That was that was really powerful. Thank you so much.That's a hard act to follow, he says. I did tell, he says, to keep his comments to 3 minutes. So. Feel free to talk as long as you want. But I don't want.It's a hard.Act to follow. That was an amazing speech. So go for it. He says.You're.Absolutely right. And she said a lot of things. A lot of sentiments that we all echo and that we all share. You know, I know that there's thousands of us, like she said, that are going through the same plight.So I'd like to start off by just thanking everybody for dedicating some of your time and attention to this matter. I know there's a lot of things going on in the world that require attention, and so it means a lot to us.As you all know, DOCA has been rescinded by Donald Trump, our president, which has essentially put an expiration date on the livelihood of all of the recipients on the program. The burden has been passed to Congress to pass legislation that will determine our future in this great country.And since Congress is an extension of the will of the people, really, our fate lies in your hands. It's. I hope you guys understand the importance and the. The fact that this decision these next few months will have on our lives.Get to know the Dreamers. Get to know who they are, you know, because this is going to be a big decision that, you know, is going to impact almost every detail of our life. Doctor recipients have been termed dreamers because we are chasing the American dream.We grew up knowing this country as a land of opportunity. When we had hard work and good values, we were told.That.If you had hard work and good values, you would prevail, you'd become successful. And where you can earn a place in society through commitment and dedication. We love this land because it gives us hope. We understand that for many of us, this is the only place that we ever wanted to call home.And the only place that we know is such. I understand that we find ourselves in our current situation because immigration laws and policies were not followed oftentimes by our parents. Many of us were not aware or could not fully grasp that concept, and it occurred in my situation.For example, I was only five years old. I do not blame my parents, however, because a parent's love for a child will drive them to great lengths in order to give the children a better chance of life. Understand the current immigration laws are complex and lengthy.Many do not meet requirements to even apply. And for those a can processing times often extend decades. I understand that many of these parents are coming from extremely dire situations places where you can work hard your whole life and still not have food on the table.Some days, places where opportunities are limited and the main out of a cycle of poverty as gangs. Or the cartel. I believe many immigrants have been misrepresented under the current political climate. As with any other society, it is true that there are immigrants, war criminals, rapists, gang members, those who pose a threat to society and those whomust be dealt with. But by lumping all immigrants under that umbrella, you are misrepresenting the majority of immigrants who come and bust a sweat every day, day in, day out, under the most miserable conditions, often working multiple jobs for low pay.Those who never ask for handouts but yet dutifully pay their taxes. Those who are willing to sacrifice the best years of their youth to give their children opportunities in life that they never had. Those who contribute to the domestic economy and prevent further offshoring.I don't blame my parents. I thank them for their strive and sacrifice because the only time I ever saw them do was get up every day and come home exhausted, sometimes well into the night. As I talk to Dreamers, I find that we all have one thing in common the faith that if you work hard in thisgreat country, you will find success. The faith is what got us through the many obstacles we have faced and are currently facing. As many of us grow up and become educated, we start developing ambitions and goals. Gradually, we come to the realization of our situation.You become painfully aware that the same opportunities are due now, are not landed to you as the rest of your peers. And you are presented with scenarios in which all of your hard work may not be rewarded, acknowledged, or even discouraged.Applying to higher education, as difficult as it is, becomes even more difficult. There's no financial aid from the government. Access to scholarships is extremely limited. You can't even apply for a job. And that's the realities that many are facing now and will face in the next six months as they get ready for graduation.A lot of juniors that are still in that same situation. And what that does is eventually you start feeling more and more of an outcast. There's a small feeling of betrayal that you overcome only by placing your faith and the values you have come to know growing up in the United States of America.The faith that as uncertain as your future plight may seem, you will find success if you keep working hard and upholding your morals. It is a difficult situation and a burden that we must live with every day. But we find hope in our community, the people we see every day who cheer us on, those who are willingto extend help and love regardless of your background. Today I stand here blessed because I have been given the opportunity to chase my dreams and goals. Thanks to the support I have received, I graduated with an MBA and I am currently chasing my dreams and I'm proudly working and paying taxes thanks to Dakar.When Dakar was issued, many of us step forward and place our trust in the American people. We understood that Daka did not grant us any legal status or federal benefits, but we were presented with the opportunity to contribute to our communities and step out of the shadows.And we grasped it. We paid the fees, and we gave up information about every detail of her life to be inspected by government officials who would decide if we get a driver's license, apply to school, apply for a job, and live under the laws of society as best as we could.Dacca was never a permanent solution. As the name implies, the ultimate decision was simply deferred. And we knew that everything we had worked for could be stripped from us at any moment. This is more apparent now than ever before.We have been living in a dream and the hopes that it would become a reality eventually. I understand that many of us. For many of us, there are no pathways to becoming documented under current immigration laws. It's not for lack of wanting or trying.We are not asking for handouts. We're simply asking for an opportunity to study, to work, to pay our taxes, to be productive members of society, to serve and protect, to be coaches, doctors, nurses, lawyers, construction workers, ultimately to give back and earn a place among the community and the country we have grown to love.Thanks for your time.Thank you. Well, I hope our Congress is watching this. I hope Jeff Sessions is watching this. And also, our president just got caught out by some incredible, incredible citizens, Denver citizens. Thank you guys so much for being here.\nReasoning:",

Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nAgenda Item for council vote 119 417 Relating to the South Lander Street Grade Separation Project, the committee recommends the bill pass.Councilmember O'Brien I think folks are generally familiar with a major project that is currently underway at Lander Street. This is a new overpass that we're building with support of a variety of funding sources that has been in the works for probably decades.To connect East West through Soto without being held up by numerous railroad crossing the Atlantic goes over. This particular ordinance purchases some very small parcels of private land around the interchange of lander and forth to allow with that project sits down.I don't have the exact number of square footage in front of me, but it's a little over $100,000 will spend to acquire the private property there to make sure that that intersection meets the design guidelines we are trying to achieve.Very good. Any questions or comments? Councilmember Baxter.Two questions. What's the schedule on this in terms of completion date? And secondly, do you happen to know whether BNSF has come back to us in response to a question? And I've asked it multiple times if they will tell us when their trains are coming through.And I know initially that they said, well, we don't have to tell you because the feds don't require it. But as we're coming through our time of maximum constraint, if people just know when those trains are coming through, it could be really helpful.So. And I'm not asking, you know, what cargo they're carrying. I'm just saying, would you tell us when the trains are coming through and when we can expect to have these intersections clogged? It would be very helpful.Yeah. Customer based. I do not have the exact opening date of that project in front of me, but there's a, I believe, at least a year to go until it's open. So part of the period of maximum constraint or the Seattle squeeze that we will, I guess, start facing today and see a significant uptick in the week. This project is one of the many projects that going on there will affect that, but I'd be happy to find out exact hoping to get back to you.It doesn't even have an exact just quarter.Sure. And then I share your frustration about some of the concerns we've had about timing, you know, originally specifically around oil trains and when they're coming through our city. And I have not heard any new information from BNSF as far as willingness to share that information, either for traffic concerns or safety concerns.So I'm just would like to just reemphasize and if anybody from BNSF is listening how important and valuable it is and would be to the city of Seattle if we knew when the trains were coming through. And, you know, it strikes me with all of the technology we have, like ways for roads that that shouldn't be thatdifficult for us to identify and to get that information.Great.Very good.What's early? 2020?We're just going to be early to.The opening of Landers Street.It's not a year from now.About a year from now. Early twenties.Thank you.Okay. If there are no further questions, please call the role on the passage of the bill.Shall I?JOHNSON Whereas I. O'BRIEN All right.

You bring them. Bring the sheet back way. Is it. Is this next one?This is not. Yeah. This is an ordinance.Is. Has been. Oh, okay. Got it.So, introduction of ordinance, amending the Alameda missile code by amending various provisions, including section two, Dash 17 of Chapter two Administration. Section one, Dash seven of Chapter one, General Section two, Dash 24 two. Dash 44.1 of Chapter two, Section one, Dash five.Penalty provisions enforcement of Chapter one, Section 30, Dash 23, Certificate of Occupancy of Chapter 30 Development Regulations and other related amendments concerning code enforcement.Good evening, Mr. McFadden. I want to introduce.Greg McFadden.Said it all made a building official. So this amount this ordinance is amending seven, six different sections of the municipal code, primarily around code enforcement. The main change is reconstituting our appeals board. In the past we had an appeals board that fell in disuse and we were using a single hearing officer.Recent court case involving the city of Oakland made that not something we can no longer do. So we've tapped three members of our historic historic advisory board who meet the requirements in the building code to sit on the appeals board.And when appeals come up, we'll have a appeals hearing prior to an H-E-B meeting. So there'll be regularly schedule meetings they can meet into our appeals process. The other changes are fairly straightforward. Section one seven just some changes to how appeals are handled.Change two We have an outdated term chief building inspector, which is no longer used, hasn't been used in a long time. Changed that to that what's the building code uses which is building official some changes to section one five increasing fines for commercial properties, a administrative change to a current practice that we have regarding certificates of occupancyfor commercial tenants where it's just a change in ownership and adding members of the Fire Prevention Bureau to the list of people who can issue administrative citations.Okay. Is there any discussion with public speaker here on this?We have no.City Councilmember Day, so. Great.Well, thank you. I was the one who pulled this. And I just have a quick question. So I have a hypothetical example when it comes to the certificate of occupancy. So suppose a coffee shop closes on Park Street and that the the the space is vacant for three months and that a new coffee shop opens if thisis adopted. Are we saying that the new coffee shop is also going to have to get a certificate of occupancy similar to the way in which the old one. Yeah.Yeah. This is not a change in policy. It's, it's clarifying the municipal code. For the past 15 years or so, we have done just what you've outlined. A coffee shop goes out of business, new coffee shop comes in, we get a certificate of occupancy.A couple of reasons. One, we want to see the space. The old coffee shop may have been there for quite some time. So we ask for a simple floor plan. We don't do an inspection. It's a minor fee, I think $109 currently.And we have actually had a recent code enforcement case that got fairly messy because the property owner didn't understand that the new tenant needed to follow the same rules as the old tenant. And this was what led to this change to clarified in the municipal code, a current practice.So currently we do, we do require a certificate of occupancy and we do collect whatever fees associated with a new tenant but the same use. It's just that the language isn't.It wasn't clear the the reading of the building code says change in use. We've interpreted it I've interpreted that to mean, okay, this is a new owner.Okay, my mike and I just want to say from the outset that my concern was that if the standard practice was all coffee shop closes spaces, vacant, all coffee shop with certificate of occupancy closes vacant and the new coffee shop comes in.And if the standard was that we did not require the new coffee shop to have a certificate of occupancy, in other words, have to shell out another however much it costs. Then I would have preferred that we not do that.But if you're saying that the standard is is that we actually do require when new uses that are consistent with zoning fill a place that we do require a certificate of occupancy. Again. Again, we have to pay the fees if that's what we've always done.But then I'm playing with that. So and the issue then is just clarifying the language and that it's correct. Yes. Oh, by the way. And I just want to make sure to say that, you know, I also submitted my questions to the staff earlier so they knew ahead of time.And to me, it's important, at least, you know, that for from the vantage point of the public that we understand, what are the issues that are concerning council members and others? Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate that. I'll move approval of staff recommendation with regard to final.Okay. I have a motion. Is there a second? A second? Any discussion? All in favor. I opposed. Abstain. Okay. The ordinance is approved unanimously. Thank you. And then was that the last of our consent?

And do we have a councilmember day so you can get your hand up? Yes, sir. Yes.Thank you, Madam Mayor. You know, in the past, I have recuse myself on anything related to the Pacific Pinball machine, even though this is something on the base, they do. I think their headquarters is Webster Street near my place.So I'll maybe just to be consistent, I'll recuse myself from this thing.Or did you want an opinion for from the city attorney or. Oh.Sure, sure. That's fine.Yes, Mr. Chan.I think in.Previous conversations with Mr. De Keyser, he he is indicated to me that because of the proximity of his home to the headquarters of this particular business, that recusal is appropriate. And I have no objections. And I appreciate Mr. de Thor.Informing me of his living location. Okay.Thank you.Okay, then. So, Councilmember Desai, we will excuse and recuse for this time. Excuse you as you recuse yourself. All right. And so who from city staff is presenting, huh? Like magic. There's Ms.. Mchunu. Good evening. We say. See her name and Lisa maxwell.Good evening. And I expect that we'll see their lovely faces. So there's one now. Coming.I'm coming.Sorry.That's all right.Good evening. There you are. Hi.All right. Good evening. Sorry. Sorry. We were having technical difficulty.As we worked him out. No worries. It's all good. So I'm just. Whoever I'd like to start, please start.I'll start. This is the almost exact same staff report that the council considered at the time of the council meeting. I'm presenting it to tenants who would like to participate in the rent relief program that the council approved in October.These are applicants for the the program that's specific to non-profits in Spirit's Alley.These are Spirit's Alley tenants.And and while the Civic Pinball Museum is a nonprofit. Just to quickly recap, this is the.933 program.Which is the tenant is able to defer red for nine months and repay the rent over a.Three.Year period of time. If they repay early, they could have up to three months of rent abated. So what you're considered what you see in front of you is what three.Months rent would be for each of these tenants, the maximum amount, which is $42,225.Which I was.Doing the math.Which would mean that of the $400,000 that the council has allotted for this program, if you approve these tenants tonight, you will have allocated or we we could conceivably abate up to 156,357. And so it's less than half of what you've appropriated.And it would, as you will have, as did ten tenants.And I believe that you also noted in the staff report that this money would come from the base reuse fund and that revenues are actually doing better than anticipated. Is that correct?Yes. Okay. I think what I say what I'm saying is that a fund balance is pretty healthy and it could absorb this program as well as the loan conversion program that the council approved in October. So the appropriation that you made for both programs are definitely we're able to handle those and keep operations at the same level. Okay.Um, okay. Great. Any any clarifying questions from council? This next one that you want to. Oh, I think I see the city manager's hand to doing. Mr. LEVITT. Yeah.So I just want to add a little bit to what Nanette said. Yes. I think we have a healthy fine balance now, obviously, with the stress on the businesses out there. We are concerned about future lease revenue, or at least I'm concerned about future lease revenue, although I think these programs are to help to try to stabilizethe businesses will help, which will hopefully help the city in the long term. But we are keeping an eye on the lease revenue as we move forward into the future.Thank you. And Ms.. Maxwell, did you want to add anything?The only thing.I'd add if there were any concerns.About know we had added.Some language.With respect to Koven.Compliance and if anyone had any particular concerns about that and wanted to raise them.We have some thoughts on how we can address those concerns if there were those.Well, that was my request and I feel pretty firmly about it. Okay. I because, you know, the reason that our businesses and our residents are many of them are suffering so much financially, psychologically is because of COVID 19.And certainly we've had some great news on the horizon recently with the vaccinations arriving and starting and more on the way. But it's going to take a while before we get enough people vaccinated to to really make a difference.And so in the intervening time, we have to adhere to the public health officer's guidelines. And I was certainly satisfied with the language in the in the amendment because it would take an actual violation, which which is something that comes after education after warning.So it's not like the first time out of the gate that I just think we have to be really consistent with our messaging and we want to help our businesses out, but they have to help themselves and others in the community.My feeling is thank you. And so if council same you clarify questions at this time. Madam, do we have any public speakers?Do not have any speakers.Okay. Counsel, let's open the discussion.I'd be happy to move approval if there's if for their approval.But I'd like to second that. We I thought we had a this is very much related to the conversation that we had at the last meeting. We just re agenda this to add the additional tenet. So, yes, I'd like this, actually.All right. We've had a motion by Vice Mayor Knox White, seconded by Councilmember Vela. Any further discussion being.Held.Here? Did you want to add anything? Your favorite thing then? May we have a roll call vote, please?Vice Mayor Knox. Right.I.Councilmember Odie. I vela. I may or as the Ashcraft high that carries by four eyes one absent and Councilmember De is on his way back in.All right. Excellent. Thank you. Thank you so much, Miss Maxwell.Thank you.

Okay, so then we are going to move on to item four, be.Adoption of urgency and codified ordinance amending in part on codified ordinance number 3 to 7 five and imposing and extending within the city of Alameda a temporary moratorium on rent increases for fully regulated residential units until June 30th, 2021.This ordinance requires for 50 votes and a recommendation to production to staff to explore additional opportunities to further provide assistance to landlords, especially small operators impacted by COVID 19.Thank you.

I'd like to. I'm going to have a few comments, but I'd like to make a motion to approve this item. Thank you. And I would ask that the conditions we've just filed presented some brand new conditions that were just updated about an hour ago.And council members should have a copy of that. So these are the new conditions that we would be proposing for this particular item. And I'd like to note that at the request of several constituents that I spoke with, I've added number 16 with the hope and recommendation that ABC will consider this condition as one of the conditionsthat will remain on this license should the license be issued, and it said upon sale or transfer of the license, the conditions included herein will be subject to review and possible modification of operating hours and specific conditions of alcohol sales.Having said that, I want to thank the Long Beach Police Department for their report. It's my understanding that they're recommending recommending approval of this of this item and recommend recommending that Supermax be granted their Type 47 license. I want to note at the outset that Supermax is a long standing, positive, contributing business partner to the city ofLong Beach and specifically to the third District. I want to thank the owners, operators and managers of the business for being responsible corporate citizens and for taking care of our community and specifically the residents and visitors of the shore.I want them to know that we have had a major outpouring of support from people who frequent the restaurant, who appreciate the efforts made by the ownership and management of Supermax to be involved in the community and to contribute in a positive way.And I also want them to know, as they know from operating in the shore, that there are a lot of concerns in the shore, obviously, about making sure that the shore does not become the type of district where we have too many bars or too many people that are not respecting the incredible balance that we try tomaintain there between residents and businesses. So it is very important and I know Supermax understands this, that they adhere to that to the strictest standards in terms of their privilege to be able to sell liquor at that location and that that be a responsible commitment that they undertake.And I know that they will take that commitment seriously and they will pay specific attention to two potential concerns, like overpowering or encouraging irresponsible behavior. So having said that, I have no doubt that Supermax is going to be completely responsible with the license that they receive.They've been in the shower since 1990. They have three locations with type 47 licenses, 14 locations total. The restaurant was established in 1974 and by all accounts is a thriving restaurant that whose primary focus is serving food. They have had minimal de minimis, as what we call it in the legal world, calls for service from the LongBeach Police Department. And we understand that the police department is recommending approval and support of this application based on their investigation, even including their remeasurement today or I think yesterday showing that there were four residents within 100 feet.With all of that, it'll be my recommendation to approve this item and request that ABC impose the conditions that we believe are reasonable based on this business and their placement in the short.Great. Thank you. There's a motion in a second by Councilmember Richardson. Did you want to comment? Councilman Richardson? Nope. Okay. We'll go to public comment. Any public comment on the item? Saying Yes, please come forward.Two extra time seemed hardly necessary. My name is William Holtz, was born in Long Beach. No disrespect to community hospital, but I was born at Broadway and Cherry at the Hermon Jones Clinic. I moved to Belmont Shore when I entered grad school at Cal State Long Beach in 1968, and have lived in the shore ever since, exceptfor two years when when my wife and I purchased a home up by Eldorado Park. We loved the area. We moved back to the shore because of all the amenities. And also I loved the weather there. I was in my current home when Super Max first opened on Second Street Live and they've always been a good neighborand acted responsibly. And I've used them to cater many parties for family and friends, and they've always been a good place to go to for affordable meals with guests. One minor drawback for the restaurant is that they couldn't serve real tequila margaritas.And I don't believe that changing their license would allow hard liquor, would have any substantive change in sobriety of their patrons. It's not an action to convert Second Street into Bourbon Street. It's more to recognize that the Shore remain healthy and thriving.Its restaurants play a critical role. Super Max is simply a family oriented Mexican restaurant. Proving this application would not change that. I don't understand the vehemence of some of the opposition to the application. Prohibition ended in 1933. We're still fighting it today.I think the application should be supported because it'll make the good restaurant a better restaurant, and that will only benefit Belmont Shore in Long Beach. Sorry to waste your time because it looks like it's going to pass. Thank you very much.Never a week is never a waste of time.Thank you, Mayor Garcia, for all you do for Long Beach. And thank you, Susan Rice, for all you do for the shore. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker. I just ate at your lovely restaurant two nights ago.I know I missed you. I was at a wedding and dancing. Oh, hi, Lisa Ramla. I'm a long time Long Beach resident. I'm on the Belmont Shore Business Association, and I am a resident of the Shore. I am 100% for letting Super Max have the new license, and my restaurant, La Strada, is located directly across the street. In fact, when people say, Where are you located? I always say, We're right across the street from super max. I've heard that I read in the article from some of the naysayers in the Greenwich Gazette that they thought that if this action was granted and they got this license, that other restaurant owners would now want to goget that license. And me being directly across the street, I have zero interest in getting a liquor license like theirs. I get understand. Because they want to serve margaritas. So I, I hope it goes forward. I the naysayers also, I, you know.Anyway.Go forward.Thank you, Lisa. And next time you're going have to bring some of your lasagna, please, because. Okay, great. I see no other public comment and no other council. We have a motion on the floor by Councilwoman Price with conditions as submitted.Please cast your votes.Motion carries seven zero.Great. Thank you.

Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThe report of the City Council Agenda one clerk 5314415 2019 State of the City address delivered by Mayor Jenny Durkan on February 19th, 2019.Just one moment. So this is a just sort of a perfunctory filing of the file, the speech, if you will, and I believe we will vote on it. And we'll place the file on the file before we vote on filing the clerk file.But anyone wish to say any words? No regrets council members want.Thank you, President Hollande. Just wanted to explain to members of the public that the vote the council is about to take will file into the city's records, the mayor's State of the City address. And of course, it should be on record.So I will be voting yes, but my vote will not be a vote on the content of the speech. However, and I wanted to bring to light something that the mayor said that was, in my view, dangerously inaccurate.Three times in his speech, Mayor Durkan said that Seattle has invested over $710 million in affordable housing during her time in office, adding, however, compare that while the claim to what it actually says in her budget, in the mayor's budget, it lists the funds that she has made available to build affordable housing.It is, and this can be verified by council members. It is less than $50 million per year, not 710 million. And as a matter of fact, if the political establishment was actually willing to spend $710 million on building affordable housing instead of under 50 million, then we could actually begin to seriously address the affordable housing crisis.The problem is that when the mayor exaggerates the investment in affordable housing, it sounds like it is not necessary to tax big business to build affordable housing on a scale big enough to have a real impact. But that would be wrong.In reality, the mayor is not investing 710 million. Really. She is investing less than 1% of the city budget in affordable housing. And regular people will need to continue to get organized to build a movement, to build anything close to affordable housing worth $710 million.And let's remember that ordinary people in New York City just won a massive victory against Amazon in its attempt to get a $3 billion corporate handout, including a helipad for Jeff Bezos. It really shows that when people get organized, we can win.This was assumed to be a done deal by everybody, including business owners, who were surprised by the fact that Amazon had to back off. So I will be voting yes on filing this Clark file, but I do not endorse her false claim about investment in affordable housing.Thank you.Thank you for those words, Councilmember. What would anyone else like to say anything before we file the Clark file? And for the viewing public, this is a public document. The facts are, I believe that Councilmember Swan was referring to our Page seven of the published document and I personally wanted to thank the Mayor for giving a speechand creating a vision for what this city could be. Okay, I'll move to file Clark. File 314415. Those in favor of filing the Clark. Please vote i i those opposed vote no. The motion carries no place.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nItem number 11, Communication from Mayor Robert Garcia. Recommendation is support. House of Representatives Bill 5624 The Economy in Motion, the National Multi-Modal Model and Sustainable Freight Infrastructure Act by Congressman Alan Lowenthal.Congressman, you have the floor.Well, thank you. First, I want to say what a pleasure it is to be back used to sit where just where everyone is sitting between Lena and Susie right there. And so just seat and second district and it is a mouthful to say that.And so I'm pleased to say it. This is called I'm Here to Talk to You About Economy in Motion, the National Multimodal and Sustainable Freight Infrastructure Act. You know, I used to say when I was on the city council that maybe this is a quick way of saying it is that, you know, we have developed here inLong Beach and this was 15 years ago, 20 years ago. And throughout that, my time in the state legislature that we have developed here in Long Beach, world class port. So does the Port of L.A. We are really we bring in 40% of the nation's cargo and then we dump these world class port into a third worldinfrastructure system, whether it's our old, decrepit freeways or rail systems that go through neighborhoods that what we don't have throughout our nation, although it's most critical to our nation, is any national investment strategy for freight infrastructure, how we're going to move the goods throughout this nation that are coming into the port of Long Beach, coming into thePort of L.A. how are we going to keep them here if we have a national freight infrastructure system, one that's efficient, it's connected, it's multi-modal, that throughout the nation we can figure out where to, you know, so that we have resiliency.This is an idea whose time has come. The president has now called for a a national freight program. The secretary of Transportation, Fox, has called for a national freight program for Congress to work on this. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee came out here to visit, had hearings actually in the Port of Los Angeles and called fora national freight program. And there's a national freight advisory committee, which we already had members from Long Beach and from our local community that are on it have also called for a national freight program. Well, that's what 5624 does.It starts that conversation is very complete national freight program, infrastructure program, with a dedicated funding stream. It says this is what, you know, the technical part of what it is. It's a formula that states, if they engage and set up what was first called for in map 21, very few states did it.California was one on a voluntary basis developed a state advisory committee that the that the kinds of projects that we're going to develop are going to come from the bottom up. They're going to come from the from the stakeholders here.We're going to have a state plan. And out of that state plan, based upon if you do your state plan, which also has environmental goals and talks about how this state plan is going to reduce greenhouse gases and other pollutants, and it's also going to build infrastructure.On the formula side of that, what each if you do this, if each state does this and has their has their state plans, they will be eligible for funds from this California being having the most existing infrastructure and southern California around the port areas having the vast majority of that will receive the largest or is will bethose projects will be eligible by formula to be. If they're in the state plan to be eligible California will get $330 million a year of for projects.That.Also in addition to these formulas they will also be competitive grants that will be grants that cities states.Together.Regions can come together and say we really need this. And of those competitive grants, there will be a certain percentage of those will be set aside for electrification and zero emission grants. And so that the kinds of things that we've talked about here and saying we'd really like to do it through our neighborhoods, but there's no moneyto do this. There will be money for those communities that want to create competitive grants that move us towards zero emission. Now, the largest thing is how are you going to pay for this? How are you going to have each having both a competitive grants and also formula grants?The way we're going to pay for this and what this puts out on the table is that we have to have a dedicated and a sustainable amount of revenue source. And in the revenue source, which will generate in this bill about $8 billion a year, 4 billion for formulas, 4 billion for competitive grants.Of that money, it will be a user fee. Those that that if you own the goods and you're moving goods from Long Beach to Chicago, you you pay to a carrier, whether it's the rail system or the trucking lines, you pay a certain you get you pay to move your goods.Well, a certain percentage, 1% of that will be in what is called a waybill. And that will be put in a. National Trust Fund, just as we have the Highway Trust Fund, which is your gasoline when you buy gasoline, that's what pays for the highways in the country.This will also those of the users of the highways pay for that. We will have the users of freight pay for the infrastructure that they will benefit by, because it will all go back into this into this $0.01.Secretary of transportation has been working with our office on this they want is many bills they like this bill in terms of the complexity and I'm not saying they're buying into the funding stream that's going to be done at the national debate.But if we really want to have freight infrastructure, we have to figure out how we're going to pay for it as a nation. And it is not going to come out of the general fund or the income tax.That is not going to be where it's going to come from. And with the sequester, the only way you can have money in from existing money is if you figure out who you're going to take it from and then figure out how they're going to replace it.So this is a it's going to be an exciting what we're trying to do is to map 21, which is the reauthorization of all of our Highway Trust Fund and our transit funds, which come from the highway and come from the excise tax on gasoline.They will all be running out this spring. This is the time. They, too, have a freight as part of a national highway, as part of our MAP 21 reauthorization. So that's really what I'm here for. I already have the support of the L.A. County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and lots of ports throughout the nation in terms of theCoalition for American Gateways and Trade Card is want this bill to be part of the discussion. The Port of Long Beach has already endorsed it. I would hoped that the local city council will also this will be of great benefit to our region.This will enable us to not only shape our port, but to do the kinds of work that will help to shape the nations. And we in California have spent so money, so much time creating this kind of structure that what we're doing is basically taking it to the nation and saying, this is what we'd like to do, and so I hope you can have your support.Well, thank you, Congressman. And I, I put this on the agenda today because I'm a big supporter, obviously, of the bill that you're that you're working on. And I think you're you always represent our interests well and always have.And so with that, I'd like to get a motion for approval because there's a motion.

I was hesitant about the taxation on our trucks and our community and the businesses here, and I'm excited to hear that we're talking through those components.I'm glad that you also signed on on to Congresswoman Huntsville. I'll be supportive of your bill tonight, and I thank you for taking us to D.C. for us.Thank you.Councilwoman Price.Thank you. I, too, want to thank you for coming here tonight. I think a lot of people don't realize just how important of a function the port has for our city and that the various ports do for our nation as a whole, and looking for ways to be collaborative and forward thinking as the port industry changes andas the competition changes I think is very important. And I thank you for representing us and for bringing this forward. And I too will be supporting this measure.Thank you.Councilman Gonzalez.I, too, want to just thank you. I know we chatted about it. Yes. We and I really appreciate you just always bringing these issues forward to us and staying committed. Your dedication and leadership to Long Beach, but also just mainly to the port, is so very impactful and especially when it comes to environmental goods movement.I mean, that's always at the forefront of what you do. And we appreciate it. Thank you.So much. Just in what.Is a real I'm sorry.Thank you. And Councilmember Andrews.Yes, thank you, Mayor. You know, first of all, I'd like to thank you, Congressman Lowenthal, for passing this bill. If passed, you know, this bill would allow the city and the port of Long Beach the necessary funding, you know, to pay ideas and movements, infrastructure and implement the changes needed to reduce, you know, greenhouse gas emission andlocal air pollution. You know, compared to the overall good it does for the economy and, you know, for the environment. And and I ask myself, is something well worth the effort that you put into this? And I hope everything goes well.Thank you.Thank you. And with that, will Castro votes members, please cast your votes.Six zero. Great. Thank you.Congratulations, freshman. We'll see you soon.

And we wanted to make sure we got that completely right. So now we have feedback from all of you.Your amendments are included. This allows for us to pass this category spend plan to coupled with the tax proposal and to then work in greater detail, much like we've done with other levies in the past, for example, the Families in Education Levy.We followed it up with very detailed spending plan to complement the categories of spending. Again, I want to thank you for her work to amend this bill so that we could have these categories here.

Taking a minute to thank those businesses that include Expedia Civic Ventures, Matthew Leong, Budget Policy Center and BFD, and all those folks that provided a lot of feedback.

So we're relying on the vendor to try to break out all that data.Thank you very much. And you had two categories and what these are overwhelming statistics. 15,000 tows last year, but 12,000 of those were impound tows. What were the other 3000, if you know.Those are city vehicle tows. Okay.Thank you. That's all.Thank you, Councilman Flynn.Councilman knew I was also just concerned about the overall financial situation with the towing service and support. Councilman Flynn And just really like to get some information which I expressed the Mayor Council but the overall break even point of this program.So I appreciate that information.All right. Thank you both. Any other comments or questions on 530? Scene nine. We have one more, I believe, Madam Secretary. 541. Councilman Flynn, would you like for us to do this?Thank you, Mr. President. I would like this put on the floor for a separate vote so that I can abstain.Certainly, Councilman can ask, would you please have 541 order published?Yes, Mr. President, I move that council bill 541 be ordered published has.Been moved and seconded. Comments. Councilman Flynn.Thank you, Mr. President. Before my election, I was employed at RTD. Under the city's code of ethics. I am not taking any action on anything related to the regional transportation district for at least six months and will abstain.\nReasoning:",
        "answer": "The meeting transcript discusses the request for a breakdown of response times in southwest Denver and the possibility of rebidding the contract by quadrants of the city for quicker response times. There is also a discussion about the financial situation of the towing service and the need for more information about the break-even point of the program. Lastly, Councilman Flynn abstains from voting on council bill 541 due to a conflict of interest.Therefore, the summary of the meeting transcripts is:\nA bill for an ordinance approving a Second Amendatory Agreement between the City and County of Denver and Ferkam, Inc., d/b/a Extreme Towing and Recovery for citywide towing services. \n (FINANCE & SERVICES) Adds one year and $1.75 million to the current contract with Extreme Towing & Recovery (for a new end date of 7-31-16,  5 year term, and total contract of $8 million) for citywide towing services (201100630).   The last regularly scheduled Council meeting within the 30-day review period is on 8-31-15.  The Committee approved filing this bill bu consent on 7-30-15."

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThank you. Was there a different one? All right. So five innocent, Nancy, five is Anne Frank. And now proclamation special orders of the day, three A We have a presentation by the Oakland International Airport on anticipated air traffic during the closure of runways number 12 and 34, maintenance tentatively scheduled for September 4th through September 18th, 2017, andduring Fleet Week, October 2nd through October 9th. Thank you.Though Mayor Spencer and council members understand there's a presentation that will come up on the screen.Oh. Thanks.All right. Well, thank you. I'm Hugh Johnson, senior aviation project manager in the Aviation Planning and Development Department at the Port of Oakland. And I'm here to present a material about the Runway 1230 rehabilitation project we have planned for September.I'll try to go through the material relatively quickly. If you have any questions, please let me know as we go along. So first I just want to indicate this is a project that we do every 15 years or so.It's a payment rehabilitation. We have an asphalt concrete runway that requires an overlay and at the same time, it needs a runway light rehabilitation as well. So the lights typically last 30 years. In this case, we have a series of runway, centerline and edge lights that also have to be repaired in sequence and just in advance ofthe paving project. We have a few images here that indicate the current condition of the runway is already cracking and we're doing regular maintenance on a weekly basis. But we've reached the point where we have to do an entire pavement overlay.This image depicts the entire south field, a pair of runways, and then the two images on the bottom depict either end of the runway. So what you see above is in yellow. It's a temporary runway that we will build using a a taxiway for the main runway, and that temporary runway will be used while the main runwayis being paved. This is a rather unique approach to doing these types of projects, and it was brought to our attention, our air introduced 15 years ago last time we did this and owe a debt of gratitude to Alameda and to San Leandro for bringing that to to the concept.Quick points we've coordinated. This is essentially going to be a two year coordination and planning effort for a two week construction project. We've coordinated with a number of lines of business at the FAA and other at the ATO, ATO as well as community outreach meetings.We held a community outreach meeting in February. We've met with San Leandro City Council a couple of weeks ago here today, and we've made ourselves available for community groups or neighborhoods that want more information. We've also we're also doing outreach through our regular aviation stakeholder committee meeting.We have one coming up, I believe, next week. We will touch on this in the Noise Forum. And I think there's a Fleet Week presentation also scheduled for a couple months from now. And I mentioned the tax away, which is an alternative approach to performing the work.And our intent is to do the painting for two weeks in September. I'll just go through this very quickly. So this colorful graphic depicts essentially a weather chart for the months of the summer months. And as you can see, we have a real advantage to doing this project in August or September.After that, the likelihood of rain starts to pick up. And we don't want the rain overlap with when we're doing especially the markings or even just the paving and light work. This is a graphic of the entire airport.The main thing I want to highlight here is we will have all departures still in Southfield. And but we will have a few large aircraft arrivals in Southfield on the temporary runway. That's different from the way it was done 15 years ago, where it was just a departures only runway and all arrivals came into Northfield.So we're going to use our field for the larger aircraft that require the additional length that we'll have in Southfield on the temporary runway. We have a longer runway, even on a temporary runway in Northfield. There's a lot of numbers here.The main thing I want to point out is on the left, the arrivals for Northfield, there will be 108 commercial jet arrivals and all of the heavy jets will arrive in Southfield. And and then about 60% or so of the commercial jets will arrive in Northfield, and the remainder will be able to be accommodated in the southon temporary runway. This is a maybe a familiar graphic for the noise forum. It shows a typical 65 C.M. Contour for the airport. And this next graphic shows how it will change representative life for those two weeks. And as you can see, there'll be a minor shift in self-heal, fewer operations in Southfield.And then you see the extent extended noise contour in Northfield, mostly due to the arriving aircraft in Northfield. A very, very minor extent into the golf course area and some of the communities there. And then on the whole roots, the focus has been to make sure that we keep our roots on 98th Avenue.There have been some recent discussions about a possible access point off of Harbor Bay Parkway, and we're still in discussions on that to determine where that will come out. And last point I want to make is that we are reusing the asphalt grinding from the runway on our stability berm and essentially reusing all of that material.Thank you. Any questions? Council members. So I want to thank you, Mr. Johnson, for coming down here and making this presentation. Thank you for sharing it.Thank you.All right. Next, we have coverage. We have a motion for the consent calendar. Accept items.If0 we have oral communication.Or I'm sorry, work oral communications, not agenda. Do we have any speakers on that?We have three speakers. Oh. Okay.Okay. The first one is for a referral to be heard this evening. I see it didn't have a name on it. If someone recognizes this writing, they can come on up and speak. I'm sorry. Could the lights be turned on?All right. I know it's Vernon, and then go ahead.I know that we might have a chance to be heard later on tonight, but if the city council meeting has to go past 1030.I would really hope that we could.Actually have our the referral heard this evening.Thank you. Gray Harris.Stepped out.Ken Petersen. Gray hairs. Can Peterson. Come on up, Mr. Peterson.Thank you very much, Madam Mayor. Council and staff. First thing has to do with the questions of sound. We've had many complaints about people not being able to hear, and we're told that if we can't hear you, just let the assistant city clerk know and they'll up the volume.The other thing is they have auxiliary hearing devices and we just try and three of them and they're just marvelous. Everything is so crystal clear. They work really beautifully. We have three of them down here.Oh, all right. I see. We have three people modeling them this evening. Thank you.Yeah.Let us know how they work out.That's really dangerous. People will know what's going on. And I just did another thing that we can't fix, and that is when people are talking, they turn aside. You can't hear because these are directional likes. And so if somebody's going to talk, you need to talk into the microphone and not lean back or off that way ortalk into the lectern. As far as the sound of the people sounding like they're mumbling with a mouthful of mush, there isn't a lot that can be done about that. I think that's inherent in the system, and I don't think that it used to be like that.We have a new system so as to improve it, but going back ten years ago and things were much better.Thank you.So that's the kind of opening things that the housekeeping. But I want to talk about things that happened the first meeting in June. And good thing I didn't come to the next meeting because I would have said among a number of intemperate things.But I'm going to talk now about yourself. Madam Mayor, I'm going to use the third person because it's talking about you. And what happened here is that you have been subject to scurrilous attacks, vilifying you. And they're false.They're not at all true about and about you or your record. Back in 2009, the school board when you were a member, had an option to have an anti-bullying program, and the anti-bullying program was supposed to take care of all students of what are called those media, California protected classes.Those are people with disabilities, national origin, ethnicity, race, religion, sexual and gender orientation and sexuality. All of those are required. They're also required to be addressed and taken care of. And so all students are protected under Title nine in the Department of Education, the United States Department of Education.Now, the things that were proposed was it classes for only one group of those protected students, and they excluded everyone else. Now, the mayor at the time, the school board member, was urging the inclusion of all of the classes and particularly the racial and religious.Thank you. Your time is up.Yeah.I appreciate that. Gray Harris, is she here? All right. Thank you. Then let's move on. Do we have a motion for the consent calendar excluding five, F and five? And as in Nancy, that were pulled?I will the approval of balance of the consent calendar.Thank you, sir.Second.All those in favor. Motion carries unanimously. Thank you. Five f.Recommendation to award a five year contract for an amount not to exceed a total.Five year.Expenditure of $8,264,931.69 to West Coast Arborists Inc for.Citywide urban.Forest maintenance services.Vice Mayor Pull this. Did you want to speak to it?So I had one question that I'd asked the city manager about earlier that was answered, which was why the total expenditure of $8 million. And that's because it's there's an option to extend for four years under the term.My second question has to do with why the golf fund fund to 80.5 is being included under the financing for this provision? And if and and how much of that how much how much of the funds are actually going to be used for this and if it includes maintenance of trees at the golf course.Good evening, Madam Mayor and city council members. We're asking you to basically approve this avoiding of this contract and the numbers actually, as you mentioned, the 10% contingencies that explains and the five year contract, which means that what those numbers are the way they are as far as the golf.The golf course. This is something that is within the. As far as I understand it, it does cover the the trees in the golf course areas. And there is also the there as you can see, there's some private trees that are belong to that are within jurisdictions of what used to be.And and there's also the work that is other work that is done for parks and recs. So it's in the contract.So that so the trees in the front, the golf funds being used is how much?So I'm I have to look at the numbers. I don't have the numbers right on the top of my head.But so is success will.Be pro-rated by the number of trees and the funding associated with it.Okay. And then I thought we have a contractor that's taking care of the golf course. Does that contract not include maintenance and care for the trees there?That's something that I would need to get back to. I don't have the actual information on that.These are probably under the city's jurisdiction or it.Can we have public commons sized.Cities, trees at the beginning?Perhaps someone might want to take out a public speaking slip.To speak on the item. You need fill slips or. You need to fill out a slip if you'd like to speak on it.I would like clarification relative to this before I feel comfortable signing off, because I think that there has been questions about the usage of golf course funds in the past for things not having to do with the golf course.So I would like to understand and get information.Right. Unfortunately, I understand this staff report is not clear enough on that. I need to get talk to your staff and get back to you.So if there is someone that could help address the answers, it'd be nice if they could fellowship it.So I guess Mary Ashcroft, if first of all, may ask the city manager, city manager, is this is this time critical?Yes, it.Is. Actually, it is. Yes.Mm hmm.So. As much as I appreciate potential Golf Commission members speaking, I think for the basis of my vote, I probably need to hear more information from staff.But I.Could you speak into the mic if you'd like to comment, please?Well, I was just thinking maybe we can just table this one and we can do a little research internally, and then we can come back to you tonight for an answer to that. Tonight?Yeah, I may be able.To do that. Well, we do have one member of the public to speak.And I'm sure he'd be allowed to speak then, too, unless you want to go.I'll take my comment as appropriate, so I'll go ahead and call Joe Van Winkle.So I believe the amount is actually indicated far down in the contract. If you read the details. And I think it's about 90 $600. And it's not actually my understanding is it's not actually for anything on the property, but rather adjacent to the property on Otis that runs along the golf course.And I think this has to do with the historical negotiation of that agreement. And I'm sure if staff gets a chance to to look at it, they'll be able to verify that.Can you all hear if you can? I hear you need to raise your hand. All right. I need the sound turned up so we can hear.I can speak.Louder. Thank you.Okay. So, first of all, in the very small print, at the bottom of that contract, way down below, there's an attachment that has all the amounts for all the different line items. And you'll find something down there. I think it's 90 $600.It doesn't specify that it's coming out of the golf fund. You have to kind of.Infer that by the location. But it's basically the strip of property that is adjacent to the golf course. It's not on the golf course. It's the Otis.I think it's Otis as it runs along there. And as part of that contract agreement, they made the contractor contribute some amount for maintenance around the golf course. So that's kind of like a business park amount.Thank you very much. All right. So that's five F. So as staff. So do we have a motion to accept this at this time? To approve it?I appreciated the assistant city manager suggestion that we. Moves a little later in the.

Anything that has to do with with the entire facility. Lisa Lumley, Division of Real Estate. I apologize. I was actually trying to get some answers out in the hallway just now.So in general, all of our leases require that our tenants adhere to all applicable laws, state laws, city laws, municipal codes, etc. where I have a number of phone calls in right now, including to Chief Manny and Tony Caro.What we're trying to confirm is, is a fire drill a true requirement in every building other than, you know, it may be high rises, but since that's only a two level building, if it is a requirement, they would be required to participate any tenant.Your email today was the first that I was ever aware that there was an issue and I've already spoken with facilities about that as well since your email, just to understand what's been going on or who they've been communicating with.So all I can do right now is defer that we are trying to understand what is truly a requirement or a regulation. Code issue versus a building protocol. And from there, if it's protocol, we'd still want to work with them and talk to them about that to understand.But if it's anything else, then no, that is part of the lease. Okay. All right. Great.

We were asked in this year's budget to try to find funding for fire station 17 and also six police officer positions. We promised that we come back this fiscal year with during the fiscal year and identify the structural funds necessary to bring those restorations into impact.We're very positive right now that we're what we're going to be bringing something shortly to the city council for some type of structural funding. We haven't identified it yet, but one of the most promising things that we're looking at right now is a safer grant.These are grants provided by the federal government. We'll be applying shortly in the next several weeks for a federal safer grant that, if successful, will provide structural dollars for the equipment and also a certain amount of the employees.And as we go forward with that, it'll last. It's not structural in the sense that it'll it'll last forever, but it'll certain carries forward for a year or two until we can help find other structural dollars for it.So that's what we're looking at. And in addition to that, we're looking at other avenues in the budget and where things are dealing with sales tax, property tax, other things where we could come to you with a structural plan to add this.Thank you. Next up is a customer supernova that the entire report was. Okay. Let me go to first concert supernova.Thank you. I'd just like to ask the city manager if if we have any dates in mind or anything you can share with us in terms of restoration dates.No, I don't. If we're lucky enough to get something from the safer ground. Like I said, we're applying this month. The deadline is this month. We should know. I would hope within a month or two, maybe 60 days, whether or not we've been successful in the ground.Okay. Thank you.And I just wanted to give a little bit of background on this item.

So this is one of those items. It's obviously very, very important to councilman super or not, and he's been consistent advocate for this restoration.And I think we could not support him more if we tried.

And it's been referred to by the community as well as those who have been working on the site is Armory Park.And the Armory Park site is a has a long history here in Long Beach. And I want to start by talking a little bit about that and kind of what led us to this point that I do think this is a special night for for Long Beach and for the legacy of someone who has contributed so muchto Long Beach. And there are very few people in in the history of our young city who have done more for not just arts and culture, but for the world of medicine than Robert than Dr. Robert COMBINER Bueno is risky, but ten years ago I began working with the Craftsman Historic Group as well as neighbor, different neighborsin the community to discuss the possibility of shutting down a parcel of Alamitos at seventh. And Alamitos, where we're Martin Luther King Boulevard also meets years later. They came up with a plan that then became became really a city plan, which we adopted.We went out, we got funds with the state and others and were able to get enough money from the from the state, from other transit funds to put together enough money to essentially take the parcel that is currently there at the street and close it down and create a parcel, a green space for the city.When this groundbreaking happens later this year, not only will we be eliminating the most dangerous intersection in the city of Long Beach, but we will be creating a new green space adjacent to the Museum of Latin American Art, adjacent to PM, and also creating green space in a community that has very little access to recreation and greenspace. In fact, it is one of the most dense neighborhoods in the city. There are still challenges there. And the fact that there isn't a lot of room in place for for young people to play has always been a challenge for for the neighborhood.So what this will do is we're really taking what was a dangerous intersection and creating a new park. The park will include a small skate park. It will include a top lot for families. It will include open greenspace.It will include opportunities for outdoor art and festivals, as well as areas for people to have a pedestrian walkway and to enjoy this kind of small green area in a really urban urban setting. Also, about a eight or nine months ago, we began a process to come up with a name for the parcel.So we had a series of meetings, including a community naming meeting and encourage the community to give their input on what to name the park. The conclusion of that discussion was we that the community and working with our office and other partners really felt that the best way to to honor the incredible legacy of the the themain benefactor to this neighborhood an area would be to name the park after Robert Combiner. And as we all know, Dr. Combiner not only facilitated the growth of one of the largest HMOs in the country and started his practice here in Long Beach, but also created and established through his job.Atrocity, the Museum of Latin American Art, as well as the the Peace Museum, which is right just adjacent to the site as well. Pacific Islander Collection. That's there. Five years ago, Dr. Gunn Binder passed away, but his dedication to Long Beach has been consistent.He has invested when you think about the investment that Dr. Gunn Byner has made to the arts in Long Beach, the way he put Latin American art into the national discussion and made Long Beach the center of that is something that's admirable.This will be the first major public space in the city and in the country named after Dr. Graham Byner. In this way, and I think it's a moment of of celebration for certainly his family, the museum and all of those that have been involved and have been touched by his generosity.And I want to end by saying that I think that Dr. Combiner is certainly best known for his philanthropic contributions. But we should never forget the thousands of people that he helped in Long Beach through his medical practice, through reaching out to low income communities, through the free clinics, through him providing oftentimes free health care to allof those residents in these in these communities. And so his contributions really stem from not just his philanthropic work, but the work he did to make a Long Beach a healthier place and his vision of of a healthier Long Beach.And so the idea of creating and naming a park, which is the important piece of having a healthy community. After Dr. Gunn Byner, I think makes a lot of sense. So. So with that, I'm going to go ahead and make the motion to record, to name the the park at Alamitos and seventh Robert Gunn Binder Park, andrefer the item to both the Parks and Recreation Commission and the Housing and Neighborhoods Council Committee.Okay. Councilmember Lipski.Yes. Mr. Garcia Was there any consideration of having the Robert and Josephine campaigner Park? Because Josephine was an extremely important asset not only to his work, but set up numerous charitable organizations as a result of their partnership together.And I think the family certainly would be very honored if both the father and the mother were included in that. So is there any way we could explore that opportunity?Well, you know, the this actual naming went through a pretty extensive community process, and this is the name that they decided on. I think there certainly will be ways at the site to honor to honor her. And I and I understand what you're saying, but this is what went through the community process.So it's one of what I'm presenting to the council.Okay. Well, hopefully we'll get the community to to go to the Parks and Rec Commission, because it would be a gross oversight to keep her out of the naming of that park. She's very responsible for his success.Good motion. And the second any member of the public was just council on this item, please come forward.Larry. Good you Kirk as the address. I support 100% with the councilman accountable for the fifth District bishops, he said. I think it was an oversight. I was not involved in that process whatsoever. But I think obtuse would be the word to describe this council's actions.If you said if you did not, in fact, remand this back to the process. And had them consider that and then bring that forward. There's nothing to lose that will be there in perpetuity. You don't put it on as a Band-Aid or something or afterthought.And it really I don't know who was responsible for and how this often got, you know, pushed through. There have been a number of dubious things relative to naming people, naming things after people and so forth that haven't been well-thought out.But you have an opportunity to to do what I think most people, decent people would expect. And since the barn isn't on fire, remand it back from whence it came, from where it came, and have them revisit that, then bring it forward.Thank you.Thank you. Any further any further comments? Okay. I just want to say I knew Dr. Gunn by her personally, and I have a great deal of respect for his work in this city and his legacy. And so I appreciate the the honor he made me receive.Okay, members, we have motion to second.

And ratifying confirming certain prior acts. The committee recommends the bill pass.That's was.Thank you. Today I think we have three items up and I'm really happy to say and thank Councilmember Gonzalez and Cashmere Bagshaw that the city actually can grow some property every now and then. And they the dual brush park requisition and I've been wanting to say this for a long time, what I've done speaking, I believe thegood lady from District One, Councilmember Herbold, would like to say a few words. This ordinance authorizes the purchase of a parcel of land located within the Duwamish Waterway Park is currently owned by King County. The purchase price is about $1,000,000.The park will serve the South Park community. City staff performed due diligence, which included obtaining soil samples that revealed low level arsenic and soil below the grass and some discrete hotspots with higher concentrations in soil below the grass at the north end.The city will promptly perform a remedial action upon acquisition of the parcel to remove the contamination, even though the locations and concentrations currently do not present excuse me, do not present an immediate public hazard. King County was notified and they agreed to reduce the purchase price by $100,000 and sufficient funds.These are sufficient funds for the city to perform the remediation. This is compliant with the requirement to pay fair market value for the property. While the city remains responsible for any park remediation costs exceeding $100,000, the results of the due diligence investigation indicate that exceeding the cost estimate is very unlikely.In addition, city staff with the assistance of the law department, negotiated that King County retained all liability associated with contaminant releases from the property. They're being remediated through EPA's Lower Duwamish Waterway Superfund Sentiment Cleanup, The Civic Development, Public Asset and Native Communities Committee recommends full council pass this ordinance.Thank you, Councilmember.

Councilmember Gonzales, you have the floor.I would love to speak as to my resolution. So this is a resolution that I'm bringing forward in collaboration and conjunction with Mayor Durkan and really excited about setting forth another action by the Seattle City Council in support of common sense gun legislation.We have, as you all know, taken many steps over the last several years to act where we believe we can act as the city of Seattle. And in fact, last week received wonderful news about our own gun safety storage ordinance that we passed here at the city council.The NRA moved to file suit against us, and that case was dismissed last week. And our law was upheld as being constitutional and in an effort to continue to be responsive to our constituents requests to continue to advance common sense gun safety legislation.It is with great pride that I introduced this resolution concerning firearms. This particular initiative, initiative, Measure 1639 will be on the general election ballot on November six, 2018. This initiative seeks to make changes to to state law related that are contained within the Firearms and Dangerous Weapons chapter of our CW 9.41 initiative.1639 would create an enhanced background check system and require firearm safety training and waiting periods before semiautomatic semi-automatic assault rifles may be purchased or delivered. And Initiative 1639 would impose age limitations on who may purchase or possess certain firearms, including prohibiting purchases by persons under age of ten, under the age of 21.And this initiative would also require certain secured firearms storage or trigger locks and criminalized non-compliant firearm storage if it results in unauthorized use. So it is my great honor to be able to present this resolution to the City Council in hopes that the City Council will have a unanimous vote to urge Seattle voters to vote yes onInitiative 1639 in the November six, 2018 general election.Thank you, Catherine Gonzales.

Recommendation two Adobe Resolution to accept and expand grant funding from the California Department of Housing and Community Development in an amount not to exceed 45 million for acquisitions and conversion of a hotel, property and constructions of a modular non conjugated shelter unit for person experiencing homelessness citywide. Thank you. We have a most interesting customer option that we want to short report on this.Would love a short report on this.Okay, great. Please, staff.Yes. We have Paul Duncan, our homeless services manager, who can give a brief presentation.An evening mayor and council member. So the, uh, this is a authorization to enter into a contract for the state through the project homekey funding. We are currently in the process of applying for funding to purchase a number of modular shelters, 30 to 35 at the Multi-Service Center.And then we are in process currently around purchasing another motel for the utilization of non congregate shelter. So similar to the purchase of the best western. This would allow us to serve more people experiencing homelessness here in Long Beach that are our most vulnerable on the street.Gentlemen, thank you for the report. I just think it's important that we highlight this. This is a this is a pretty significant grant. Acceptance, but also application that we are engaging in every day. Residents ask, What are we doing about homelessness?I think this is a huge step forward and something that we need to definitely highlight and look forward to. Seeing tiny homes built and acquiring more hotels to serve as transitional housing for for those experiencing homelessness in our city.Councilmember Ringo.Glad to support.Thank you. My only question and maybe it's mistaken for somebody from staff because obviously this is really fantastic for the city and for I hope folks that are in-house on the Tiny Homes Initiative. What's the current timeline looking like?Is there anything updated from the last time we discussed? Are we still.There isn't an update. But what I would say is that once we get the the grant funding from the state, the idea is that we would use modular homes as a way to expedite that timeline. And the key there in terms of the timeline from the purchase to the installation is just making sure that the homes thatwe get are certified by the state so that we don't have to go through the planned check and inspection process locally. So that is something that we're in the process of exploring so that when we get the funding, we can identify the the manufacturer of homes that are certified by CD so that we can expedite.They're being put up and occupied pretty quickly. I can coordinate with the staff and get a rough timeline for you, but we're thinking it's probably somewhere between 60 and 90 days. And just keep in mind, I think we talked about it during the closed session when this item came up, is that we do have a requirement asa condition of the grant that once we receive that funding, we have a very quick turnaround to get the the that the units up and occupied. So we're planning ahead to be expeditious so that we can get them turned around in compliance with the grant procedures.Thank you. And from an I remember you had been be looking at narrowing down locations. Has that gotten any further on the modular housing initiative?Well, we are in addition to the tiny homes, we continue to explore other potential locations in the city and that effort will continue. We haven't identified a specific location yet, but we are we do have a number that we're looking at and we'll be bringing something forward once we have a site that we'd like to recommend tomove forward.Great.

Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nAgenda Item one Constable 120119 relating to employment in Seattle and many sections 100.025 and Section five of Ordinance one two 6 to 74. And to establish a new date for ending hazard pay requirements and automatically repealing the ordinance.Thank you, Madam Clerk. I'm calling up the reconsideration of passage of Council Bill 120119 to consider passage of the Bill and the Mayor's veto. The reconsideration of Council Bill 120119 is now pending before the Council. Before I go to my colleagues for some comments, I want to add I want to add a few.I want to kind of contextualize where we're at with this particular ordinance and what we're doing here today. And then I'll go to my colleagues for some comments. First of all, thank you, Corina Bull, for pulling this together for me and our own surveys.Who put this together for me this morning? So I just want to put how this how we got here today. So for reference, this is a quick hazard pay timeline. So on January 5th, 20/25, 2021, exactly one year ago today, council passed emergency ordinance establishing hazard pay for grocery employees and the vote was 8 to 0.Everyone voted yes and I did not vote because I was not here. So anyway, then on February 3rd, hazard pay for grocery for grocery ordinance for the grocery ordinance went into effect. And then from there, we started with Council Bill 120119, which is what's before us today.And those were the amendments to the hazard pay for the grocery employees. That is, that this would be the bill to end hazard pay requirements upon the effective date of the ordinance. And again, that's what's before us today.So on July 9th, 2021, out of Councilmember Mosquito's Committee, Finance and housing, the bill was voted out of committee vote 2420. And in favor of that vote were Council member Chairman's Data Council President Gonzalez. Councilmember Lewis. And I believe Councilmember Herbold abstained.Then on July 27th and August 9th and September 13th, this Council held the bill on those three dates. On July 27th, Council voted to hold passage of the bill 7 to 0. Not present was Councilmember Morales and mosqueda on August 9th.This council again voted to hold passage of the bill. It was 8 to 0. The only person not present that day was Council President Gonzalez. Then on September 13th, Council voted again to hold passage of the bill. It was a 9 to 0 vote.So everybody voted yes on September 13th to hold passage of this particular bill. This bill then were to the full council again on Monday, December 13th, 2021, and the vote was 8 to 0 to end hazard pay. Everyone was present except for council members to want.So that's why the vote was 8 to 0. So on December 27th, 2021, Mayor Durkan got this piece of legislation and she vetoed it and returned the bill back to council. So here we are today, exactly one year to the day, January 25th, 2022.So Council will have an opportunity to reconsider passage of the bill. So I am going to at this time turn it over to any of my colleagues that may have some comments to say. And then I'm going to give some instruction about how we're going to vote on this.So with that, I'm going to open up the floor. Colleagues. Councilmember Herbold. I see your hand is up.Thank you so much. Madam President, your sharing of the history of Council's decision to not act on the suspension of hazard pay on several occasions over the last last several months. And appreciate that that. That those actions that the council has taken in the past to do not vote on this legislation reflected the uncertainty that many councilmembers had around the timing. When I did vote on the hazard pay, the ending of the hazard pay, the legislation, I did say publicly at that time that I recognize that we may need to revisit it because of the uncertainty.And this was this vote was more than just a little bit more than a week before the surge. So I'm concerned. Hasn't happened yet. Many of us, myself included, said when we voted on the the termination of hazard pay, that that we may need to revisit it and that we recognize that public health is the number onepriority as we continue to get it. Advice from public health officials. We must react quickly to protect the health and safety of our constituents. I issued a statement after the mayor's veto of the council's bill saying that I supported it and I'm glad to be here today to affirm my my support of continued hazard pay for thesefrontline workers at essential businesses. Thank you.Thank you. Councilor Herbold, is anyone else that would like to comment? Councilmember Nelson. Go ahead.Thank you very much. President Suarez. I'm going to vote in favor of the substitute because I think you did the right thing in December in sunsetting the $4 an hour hazard pay increase, which you passed as emergency legislation before the vaccine was widely available.And now 87.5% of residents over 16 are vaccinated in five, five years and 83% are vaccinated. So, you know, there Durkan vetoed Council Bill 120119, which repeals hazard pay shortly after, maybe just days after Obama came on the scene and before we knew anything about its transmissibility or its virulence.And now, according to public health officials, seems to be going in the right direction. It's anticipated that it'll peak in February and locally. The Seattle King County Public Health Dashboard shows today that the number of new cases in Seattle is down 49% from last week.So the point is that conditions have changed. And since your original legislation know Washington in it's official I mean it's it's reopened officially and in June schools are back open for in-person learning. Just today, UW announced that it will go back to in-person and our own libraries are reopened and our librarians aren't getting hazard pay.So here's why this matters. I have spoken with PCC and the independent grocers, and they're really struggling with this with this significant pay increase. I'm concerned about their viability because if they close those jobs go away and the neighborhood loses that asset.And, you know, there was one example, the grocery outlet in District two that did close. So that is why I'm concerned. And we're not talking about Kroger here. We're talking about large the family owns some, many of them family owned.And if they don't raise their if they don't close, they might have to raise their their prices. And we already know what's happening with prices and with all the supply chain problems. They're already going up and working families are hurting.So that is the crux of the matter for me. If we vote no on this legislation, in other words, sustain the mayors, veto this hazard pay increase, will increase indefinitely until the mayor calls an end to the civil emergency.And right now, most of the other jurisdictions have already sunset or repealed their hazard pay. I think that maybe you're in Edmonds are two exceptions, but the vast majority, pretty much all of them have ended this. And the United Food Workers of America Local 21 didn't signal its green light for the repealing of hazard pay, and Ibelieve that they were already negotiating a contract. So that work is ongoing right now. And it was said in committee in December that this legislation was not intended to be a permanent wage replacement. And so let's let wages be dealt with in contract negotiations.So if we pass this proposed substitute, the $4 an hour wage will be in effect for another month to 30 days. We're likely to have more information about it at that point. And I believe that this thing is going to keep changing all the time.We don't know now there's a new unaccompanied. But the point is we have to follow the recommendations of public health officials. And that is and and the mayor's letter in vetoing this said that I'll quote it in the new year, the the incoming administration in the city council will have the benefit of much more information regarding onthe front end its impacts. If you work with organized labor other workers in impacted businesses to evaluate the appropriate next steps. And I think that we're at that time for appropriate next steps, and that is why I am going to vote in favor of this legislation.And. Q Councilmember Nelson, is there any one else, Councilmember Peterson.If you council President Juarez colleagues, as you know, I voted for the original bill in January of 2021 to support Seattle grocery workers and require their employers to provide hazard pay. I also supported efforts to keep it in place for a full year due in part to the earlier delta variant of the coronavirus.I have been, however, torn about whether to continue to require those payments into 2022. Just a few weeks ago, on December 13, eight of us voted to sunset this hazard pay. I know several of my colleagues, including Kasper, are making good points about why to support and uphold Mayor Durkin's decision a month ago.Ultimately, however, I have decided to be consistent with my December 2021 vote, and so I'll be voting to override the veto of our former mayor so that the hazard pay requirements could sunset in 30 days. I want to acknowledge that frontline workers in numerous industries that bravely serve Seattle every day should not only be paid well, butalso be able to work the quantity of hours they need. And a key question for me is when is it a city government's role to intervene and require business owners to pay above their current compensation? The pandemic has spurred the creation and expansion of many relief programs funded by several different sources.And I have supported nearly all of these interventions because the pandemic is an extraordinary crisis warranting extraordinary responses. In my original vote on January 20, 21, a year ago to support grocery workers. It received criticism from several of my constituents when the Cincinnati based Kroger company announced the closing of a cherished QVC grocery store in the Wedgewoodneighborhood. But I stand by my original vote a year ago, but I need to explain why I think we should override the mayor's last minute veto of our sunset legislation. Again, Seattle has imposed this special hazard pay for a year.The supplemental pay would not end immediately, but rather after 30 days. Dr. Satechi recently announced that things look like they're going in the right direction. Today, the University of Washington and Seattle University announced they would be returning to in-person classes next week beyond the government imposed minimum wage.I believe workers and their employers should negotiate compensation and benefits without a local government dictating what they must be. The local union, United Food and Commercial Workers, you have CWA Local 21 is very effective throughout Washington state and beyond and advocating for the grocery workers they represent in organizing those who may want to form a union andinfluencing policymakers. Temporary hazard pay for grocery workers already ended months ago in all 35 California jurisdictions that originally required it. And it is also ended in about half of the Washington state jurisdictions that required ending the hazard pay in Seattle to make it more financially feasible for other stores to move into the Wedgewood location and open storesthroughout Seattle or to to remain in business as we strive to emerge from the COVID pandemic. I believe it may be time to transition away from some of the emergency measures we have put in place over the past two years, unless such measures are required by public health authorities or funded by the federal government.And so I'll be voting to override the mayors veto today. Thank you.Thank you, Councilor Peterson. I see that. Councilmember Swann, you have your hand up. Please.What I am, of course, opposing the legislation originally sponsored by self-described progressive councilmember mosquito that would end the $4 an hour hazard pay that grocery workers depend on during this public health emergency. In other words, I am voting to uphold the veto from the outgoing mayor.We know that 300 over 330 community members have emailed the council, saying that the council cannot dare to repeal the hazard pay. We've seen a petition to the council from Trader Joe's workers over 40. What Trader Joe's workers have signed this petition urging the Council to maintain the hazard pay.In December, this bill came to the Council for a vote on a day that I was out sick and scandalously all of the eight other council members were present. All Democrats voted to end the hazard pay for grocery workers.This is totally unacceptable. As I had explained in council meetings throughout last summer when this bill ending hazard pay almost came to a vote several times when the vote was held, which means that the vote was delayed at the time.Grocery workers have risked their lives on poverty wages to make food available to all of society through throughout this crisis. I have repeatedly argued that the hazard pay should not only be maintained for grocery workers, but should be extended to all frontline workers for as long as this public health emergency lasts.To get a sense of how anti-worker the Democrats ending of the grocery worker hazard pay was, consider the study released by the Economic Roundtable of U.S. workers in Washington, California and Colorado. This survey shows that while Kroger CEO made $22 million last year, most of the company's frontline workers faced homelessness, addiction or hunger.The study surveyed a staggering 10,000 workers and found that more than three quarters of Kroger's workers are food insecure. 14% faced homelessness in the past year. And real wages for Kroger workers have decreased in the past few years, while executive profits have increased.The original hazard pay ordinance said that the hazard pay should last as long as the COVID public health emergency lasted, as long as there is an emergency. Hazard pay is really the least that grocery workers should be getting.Former Mayor Durkan vetoed the end of hazard pay, which was not the right thing to do. And we have to be clear that she had no choice but to veto. She's a she was a corporate politician, but she had no choice to veto because the bill came to her desk right when Omicron started sweeping the city councilmembers and as you've heard today, have attempted to excuse their anti-worker vote in December by saying that they could not have predicted on the crime. While it is true that Omicron could not have been precisely predicted, that is not the question at all.The question is why were councilmembers many of these self-described progressive councilmembers so eager to end the hazard pay for grocery workers, so eager that they could not even wait for the official state of emergency to end in our city?At the same time, the city council itself gets to be safe and work from home. Kroger executives get to be safe and work from home. None of these excuses are acceptable. And councilmembers Nelson and Peterson not only say that they believe that voting to end hazard pay in December was the right thing to do, but also saythat they're voting to end hazard pay now in the middle of the deadly Omicron surge is just stunning. My allegiance to the is to the grocery workers, not to the bosses at Kroger. I will, as I said, of course, be voting to maintain the hazard pay.I really urge all council members to reverse the scandalous position you took in December and vote to maintain the hazard pay. Finally, I want to urge all council member working people in Seattle to support grocery workers who are rank and file members of your CWA as they fight this year for a decent contract and to stand withStarbucks workers fighting to unionize and to fight and to push for rank and file driven, democratically organized unions. I also want to be you know, I want to say that last year across the country, inflation far outpaced wages.In other words, the average family took a real pay cut, a pay cut in real terms last year because even earned wages may have gone up. In nominal terms, inflation has outpaced it. As an economist, I want to be clear that Councilmember Nelson's assertion that price increases are somehow caused by the tiny wage increases by the lowestwage workers is completely unfounded. I mean, this has no basis in statistical evidence. Wages are falling behind prices. While stock market speculation runs rampant. Grocery workers need hazard pay, but also need a substantial raise, safe working conditions and decent hours.I stand in solidarity with grocery workers, rank and file members of UFW in their fight to protect hazard pay and also with all grocery workers, whether they are unionized or not, who are fighting for this hazard pay and for all non-unionized grocery workers to get unionized and then fight for a good contract.Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember Swan, before we. Is there anyone else that would like to say before I say a few closing comments? Thank you. CARLSON Swan, thank you for your comments. But I just want to add that members are reminded it is never in order to attack the integrity of your colleagues for why they are voting the waythey are voting. Its every member should be reminded that it's never an order to make personal comments or undermine what party any of us belong to. I think everybody is trying to rely on each other and hold each other accountable to the rules of civility, decorum and kindness.So while you may not agree with the vote of our colleagues, Council Member Nelson and Councilmember Peterson, and you may not agree with what you deem any particular party, it's really it's really just isn't helpful for the debate and the civility and for the city council to move forward and to the discussion, quite frankly, about how weapproach not just today's work in front of us, but every day the work in front of us. I will add, Councilmember Nelson, you did refer to the mayor's veto letter, which was dated December 27th. I. Madam Clerk, please correct me.That's in the clerk file. Correct?The actual mayoral veto letter is part of the record and is on the agenda. Today's agenda as well.Okay. And so if somebody who's been listening and wanted to see that letter, they can easily access it.That is correct on today's agenda.Okay. So with that, is there any other comments? Okay. I don't see any. I'm going to give a few more comments about how we're going to move forward on this vote. So here we go. And again, thank you, Madam Clerk, and thank you, Karina Bole, and for assisting us in getting us through this.The procedural the procedural piece of this. The city council will now vote to reconsider passage of Council Bill 120119 and to either override or sustain the mayoral veto. During Roll Call, council members will either vote I to pass the bill an override the mayor's veto or no to not pass the bill and sustain the veto.If the vote on the motion is tied or two thirds, that is six or more votes. No, the bill fails and the veto is sustained. If the vote on the motion is six or more votes in favor, the bill passes, the veto is overridden, and all provisions within the bill go into effect.Are there any questions on the procedural vote? Councilor Peterson.Thank you. Council President. I might have heard it two different ways. So if we're voting to override. Is that a yes or no?I'm just getting to that. So let me get through the rest. All right. I have an A. I'm going to read a little bit more than I'm going to. I'm just going to wrap it up. Okay. As a reminder, council members will either vote yes to pass the bill and override mayor's veto or no to not passthe bill and sustain the veto. Now, let me tell you what this means to me. A vote of yes ends hazard pay. In hazard pay in overrides the veto, and a vote of no would sustain hazard pay. It would not override the veto.So with that, any other questions? Okay. So will the clerk please call the role of on the passage of Council Bill 120119 and the consideration of the mayoral vote.Nelson.I.PETERSON Yes.Sergeant No.HERBOLD No.Lewis No.Morales No. Council President Suarez.No.Two in favor. Five opposed.So that means the motion fails, correct? Madam Clerk. And the bill does not pass and the veto is sustained.Alice. Correct. Council President.Okay. So we are done with that. Okay. Can we read the next week under committee reports? We have another vote here. Madam Clerk, can you please.

To increase the amount of city participation in the cost of tenant improvements from 1.2 million to 3.4 and broaden the scope of allowed users uses.And to execute a lease agreement and option to purchase agreement with the County of Los Angeles and a sublease between the city and MHC, the property located at 1945 Palmer Court to be used for parking at a cost of 222,000 over ten years.District six.Q Thank you. We're going to start off with our staff report.Mayor council members to night. We're proud to present this effort, which caps off a ten year effort to find a new home for MH or Mental Health America. MH is one of the premier homeless service providers in Long Beach as well as our entire country.Tonight's action will move most of the services from its current location at Fifth and Elm to 1955 Long Beach Boulevard, where they will make more of an impact in our community. I can't say enough about Councilmember de Andrews and how much he has been working toward ending homelessness, providing service to homeless folks in his district and inLong Beach in general, and working with us to provide a facility there on Long Beach Boulevard in 1955. Last week, our point in time homeless count, our biennial homeless count, showed that homeless conditions, at least at a point in time, were down 21% in Long Beach.Chronic homelessness was down 26%. Along with our health department and its Homeless Homeless Services Bureau, Mental Health America, or MSA and our other providers have been key in this drop in homelessness. Tonight's action will help further reduce homelessness and provide services to homeless people throughout our community.And with that, I'm going to turn it over to our director of Economic Development and Property Services, John Keisler, as well as one of the deputy city attorneys, Richard Anthony. John.Good. Thank you, Pat. Good evening, Mayor, and members.Of the city council.I'm going to present a little bit of history about the base re-use and closure process associated with Schroeder Hall.And how.We got to the place that we are today.So in front of you, you should have a presentation.That that begins with some.Some familiar pictures. Back in.2006.The federal government surplus, the the Schroeder.Hall facility, and through the base reuse and closure process.Required.A homeless services.Agreement to transfer transfer the property to the city. In 2008.The city signed an.Agreement with the major who was approved by the federal government to provide those services.Mr. KEISLER Yes, I know this is a large presentation. Most of us have have had to put the public presentation, I think laughs and this was up. So yeah, I just talked to Councilman Andrews. I just go through it, but expedited if possible.Excellent. Thank you. Yes, sir.Yeah. So fast forward in the week. In 2010, the federal government approved a swap so that we can move the East Division substation at Los Coyotes over to the Schroder Hall facility. And through that, the city purchased a property at 1955, 1965, Long Beach Boulevard.And so where we are today is to talk about a project for a consolidated MTA Health Administration facility, along with our new.Partners, Third.Wave Marketplace and the Children's Clinic. So that the unique aspect of this project is the public private partnership.That's involved.Between the public sector, private sector and nonprofit sectors. Additionally, what's innovative about this partnership is that the services provided by MHC will be also.Supplemented.By a street front retail.Center.And the integration of wraparound services from workforce development to medical, financial, job training and permanent supportive housing. Something interesting about this particular.Partnership with the city and MJ.Is that MJ represents the gateway to what the city has.Called the continuum of.Care. And this is a national model whereby homeless.Individuals or individuals seeking mental illness.Support can enter into the continuum of care and move from the homeless situation into housing. Over 80%.Of the clients of MHR are.Actually housed and they come to the Amaechi Support Center for services that range from financial management to life skills and jobs training so that we can help keep those formerly homeless.Individuals.In a permanent supportive housing.Situation. So the amendment or the.Amended agreement that you're being presented with tonight includes both the lease agreement with.MH as in the city, as well as some additional funds to.Help with the tenant improvements.Of the.Building itself, the design for the café and the retail space, third wave marketplace, some seismic retrofit.The reconfiguration.Of the floor plan.So that partners and supervisors and an.Estimated 80 staff members can, can, can work there as well as.Construction contingency and additional funds for.Parking. The amended proposal includes the new partners and.Investors in the project. The Good Neighbor Conditions.Program Supervisors Onsite establishes the regular business.Hours.That the community room will be available to.The public after 5 p.m. on a daily basis or by appointment as.Available. 100% Security Patrol during regular business hours.The Health Clinic by appointment.Only security cameras link to the L.B. Corp. system and a 24 hour hotline with a private.Security firm for the first two.Years, which will allow for us to also.Collect.Important data about MJ and the operations, as well as a secure waiting area.For member appointments in the rear area off the main street. So just going through real quick, the partners in this project.Are our Economic and Property Development Department who.Are looking for.Opportunities for workforce, property and business development.MH Which is one of our most well-established national nonprofits for mental health services and the Children's Clinic, one of our local providers. Founded in 1939 by physicians locally to provide some of the medical care at the facility.The other partner who will be operating the retail.Space is Charles Lu in Third Wave Marketplace. Charles Lu is an award winning entrepreneur who's been featured in the L.A. Times, L.A. Signature Magazine and other.Publications for his unique and.Innovative projects, including some.Of the most creative.New enterprises.In the L.A. Arts District in Warehouse District.And you may be familiar.With some of his other operations. So we're very excited to welcome.Charles Lou.To Long Beach Boulevard, where he will.Operate third wave marketplace. And with that.The next steps that we're looking.At after approval of.The lease agreement.Is an executed lease.Amendment.With the good neighbor.Conditions in in it.The submit the site plans and to secure the permits for construction.So this will just kick off the ability for the parties.To move forward with.The construction design and secure.Those site plan permits as well as construction with a grand opening estimated in 2018.So with that.I'm happy to answer any questions and.Thank you for your.Time.Thank you for that presentation. I'm going to turn this over to Councilman Andrews.Yes. Thank you, Mayor. And also Mr. Caruso. I think that everyone who realized that this has been a very tedious project here. But finally, we got it to the point that I think we're going to be able to make a motion tonight and move this on because first and foremost.I want to say that this is and has been a long journey for MHRA. I'm extremely disappointed with the delay in the project and.Reservations to move it forward. But I met with our city manager and the Department of Economic and Property Development and have ESA and ensure that this is the final attempt to bring this project to fruition. This is a much needed service to our community and I hope MHRA complete and, and comply, you know, with the, the agreementand become a good neighbor in the sixth district. Because like I said, this has been a long journey and I would only hope that these individuals, especially our association and the City Six District, have come along with me and made it possible for this thing to come fruition.So stay with us. Be with us. And we hope those individuals there will have a place to go to enjoy themselves and get the treatment.That they need. And thank you very much. And I move to group.Thank you. Motion to the motion in the second by Councilwoman Gonzalez. Councilman Gonzalez.Yeah, I'd just like to say that I'm very excited to see the shift in that will have more opportunities to liven up along Beach Boulevard, more central in the city. And what's exciting to know as well as that, you know, although most of the services were in the first District, a lot of residents didn't even know theextent to which MH was, was, was providing. And so I will say that now moving to central Long Beach in an area that certainly also needs certainly more economic investment and many of these resources, I think it's it's upon all of us to really get to know these services.And I hope that each and every one of you can tour the area and really see what it's what it's all about in this city. It's fantastic. And there is a amazing group of individuals that work there as well, mostly all local Long Beach residents.So thank you.Thank you, Councilman Price.I just want to express my support for this project. This is it's really exciting and I'm very happy for the city, for Maté and for Councilman Andrews in terms of this development. A fantastic update by Mr. Keisler. I could not be more supportive.Congratulations on an exciting partnership.Vice Mayor Richardson.Just want to chime in. Say, this is this is an incredible project. I have followed it, you know, particularly proud of the way that we've been able to look at interesting financing mechanisms, including looking at some of the proceeds from the sale of redevelopment properties to reinvest in central Long Beach.That's sort of in the same spirit of how redevelopment was set up in the first place. I also want to say this is high quality and very well done. The plan was thought out and I want to say congratulations and thank you to the developer, Mr. Lew, for it looks like a very high quality establishment.And keep it up. There's plenty, plenty of opportunities, including here in North Lombard, to look at those. And the last thing I'll say is that, you know, I heard a really, really interesting rumor about this project. It's not a rumor.I've been sort of hassling B Andrews and his chief of staff about this for a while, but needed. You get Metta World Peace in on this project. I need not to say more. He will be on the project.Thank you very much. Once again, congratulations. This is an amazing project.Thank you, Councilmember Pearce.Yes. I, too, want to congratulate the team that worked on this. Councilmember Andrews, I know you've worked hard on this and your staff really made sure that you found the best project for your neighborhood. MHRA has been a great partner in educating me on so many resources and programs in our community, and so an opportunity for youto grow and really serve a broader community I think is important. And public private partnerships with with Mr. Lu is fantastic. I've been to a couple of his establishments and having business leaders like himself that put their heart in the same place that they're trying to grow is a great model for Long Beach.And to have people like that looking at Long Beach, that's I think the Long Beach way. And so I'm really excited to see this project develop. And thank you again to the staff that also worked really hard on this.Congrats, everyone.Thank you. Let me just add first to to MHRA and to all of the the great individuals are going to be working there and to all the folks that are going to be served. Just thank you for sticking with this project and thank you for making it a reality.I'm very been very involved in talking to Councilman Andrews and his his support for this project. I really appreciate his willingness to take on, which is for a lot of folks, a difficult issue. But we know it's also the right thing to do.And when you look at the location, particularly next to transit, it is a a home run opportunity for the city and for all the folks that are going to be served in this location to have access to transit, to have access to expanded service, to be able to what I love is to be able to not justget service to improve their own lives, but then possibly have access to a job and get the workforce training with and at these restaurants or establishments that are going to be established there on site. And so this whole idea of creating a pipeline into the workplace, into the workforce, taking care of someone's mental health and really providingan important service. I also want to add, I think this is important is one thing I've seen that this that I'm really proud of this council, particularly in the last couple of years, is everyone is is stepping up to help address this challenge.And whether it's the conversation around the the the year round shelter, whether it's a conversation around this facility and others in the future, I'm really proud that everyone has taken a holistic, city wide look as and how we address the big challenges ahead of us and how we support these people that really need, need our support.And I'm really proud of this project as well. And I want to thank Councilman Andrews and and MLK as well. And with that, I'll take any public comment, please. There's a motion to approve the recommendation.Very good do address on file. This is certainly a commendable project and certainly Councilman Andrews is to be congratulated, congratulated for championing this. The one item that I have a concern about is not the issue in chief, but rather, once again, we've got the mayor.Jerking the agenda around like Seinfeld's. Kramer enters and leaves the room. I've got to believe that in a project like this, there are some people whose schedules are set. They look at an agenda. They plan on being at a given time down here.And then we've got the pipsqueak jerking that around for reasons various. That practice has to stop not just on this, but any other item if it's listed following with abandon, that odious concept of trying to mimic Seinfeld's Kramer and follow it in the remaining few weeks or months that you have in office.Thank you.Thank you. Next week or please.Mr. Mayor, honorable members of the City Council. Good evening. My name is Dave Pilon. I'm the president and CEO of Mental Health America of Los Angeles. And I'm here tonight to thank you for taking action to provide my agency with the resources needed to build our new health care facility on Long Beach Boulevard.These funds will enable MHRA, along with our partner, the Children's Clinic, to provide both physical and behavioral health care to some of the most vulnerable people in the city of Long Beach, those who have a serious mental illness and are also at risk of homelessness or actually homeless.The funds will also provide a community room for the use of local resident neighborhood associations and other nonprofit community groups. It was Gandhi who said that a nation's greatness is measured by how it treats its weakest members. And I think that he would surely approve of the action that I hope and anticipate that you will take tonight. And while I'm grateful to all of you for your affirmative vote on this motion, I need to single out one member of the city council, this particular responsible for this positive outcome. When the city and Metro reached the impasse in our efforts to find a mutually acceptable site for our program, it was Mr. De Andrews who hadthe courage to step up and welcome us into the sixth District. Mr. Andrews, thank you for your support of MHR and more importantly, thank you for the support of the vulnerable population that we serve without the generous and tireless work of you and your staff.I do not believe that we could have made this a reality. MHRA looks forward to continuing work with you and your staff to ensure that our health care center will become a hub of activity and promise and the pride of the Sixth District in Long Beach.We will not let you down. I also want to thank city manager Pat West and City Staff John Keisler, who are Tyler's tireless in working out the details of the agreement between MHR and the city. I also want to thank our own director of real estate, Bob Emmerson, who served as our point person for all those negotiations, and Julia Scholesy MHRA, former chief development officer who raised more than $1,000,000 in support of this project. And finally, I hope you'll forgive me for giving a shout out to all the staff and board members. And friends of the MHRA are here tonight.You all rock, and I'm proud to be your CEO. Thank you. And I'll be happy to take any questions.Thank you. Next speaker, please. Thank you so much.Hello. Hi. My name is Matt Houston. I have autism and PTSD. And I just wanted to give you a little bit more perspective on or at least my perspective on this thing called mental health. In some cases, I believe that mental health is a perspective and one one example of that throughout history is a diagnosis that usedto be called drop Beatlemania and Jupiter. Mania was a type of schizophrenia that they said that's escapes hat that escaped slaves had because the Bible said that slaves should submit to their masters. Now, that's a very extreme example, granted, but that's something in our history that that has been part of the state and part of the enforcementof of these mental health statuses. And I think we need to be really careful about making sure that someone's political affiliation or their personal risk or their stance on certain things doesn't get assessed by another person as being a sign of a mental illness.Whereas if you read some of the laws in the state, they say that if a person, a person is deemed by someone outside of the judicial process to be a danger to themselves or others, which is an opinion, first of all, I believe that any detention should be in line with the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonablesearch and seizure and requires that there be probable cause. A personal example of mine when sorry I'm shaking because that's how much it affects me. But in 2003, when we went to when the U.S. went to war with Iraq, I did a hunger fast for 48 hours and operated in in the civil rights space by hooking upmy vehicle to a power inverter and running an extension cord underneath the railroad tracks in West Palm Beach, Florida, to a bus stop that was just right on the other side of what I consider to be a basically an apartheid area that was divided by railroad tracks, which is very common in the south.I went to a fresh French restaurant down Clematis Street, and I got water and ice and I went to the grocery store and I got Hershey's Kisses and I brought them to the 100% African-American group that was at the bus stop every day without without being taken care of, without having electricity there while right across the street. As I'm bringing. Getting the ice water. Donald Trump is standing there. You know, I don't know what the connection there is, but all I know is that. Shortly after that, I was attacked with by a group of white supremacists and an ice pick was put in through the back of my head and I was taken instead ofto a hospital. I was taken to a mental health facility and told that it was my actions that caused the damage to myself and my. I was a programmer for Professional Golfers Association. I was there. I was supposed to go to CNN Center.My job was taken. My apartment was taken. So this idea that. So these facilities are a refuge for an alternative. Homelessness, in my experience, is not the case whatsoever. And I think if you're going to be assigning money to anyone, I think you, you know, put yourself in the places that of the person that are going inthere.So time is all up. So I just need you to. Thank you very much, sir. Okay. Thank you very much. Next speaker.Good evening, Mayor and Council.My name is Mike Murchison. I'm here on behalf of IKO, one of the next door neighbors for MH here down the road. I do want to take one moment in something that has been bothering me for a very long time.I've been coming to council meetings for the better part of probably 20 plus years, more than most of you in this room. And when I hear folks come down on the.Microphone and they're disrespectful and they say unkind words to the elected officials that.Take up the time to serve our community. Whether you agree or disagree on the issue is not the point, is the point that you show respect to the elected officials. I think there's a very sensitive issue here when you talk about mental health.So I believe that MH will be a very credible, very credible business in the sixth District. I think that the councilmember leading the sixth District has done a very credible job in bringing them there to that community. I would like to point out just one thing on behalf of IKO, who's been there for 30 years and thecounty leased from them the parking lot. I think it's very important.That we try to work out a mutual relationship between Iko MH.And the city of Long Beach. So just respectfully, Mayor and council, I asked that Mr. Geisler, who's been very upfront with me all the way through.Continue the negotiations to allow IKO to be able to.Park for any development that they've lost a tenant either guarantee that they have the opportunity.To build a new.Development which will be important to the.Sixth District.They're going to need parking and they don't park up to code currently.So I just asked for you to.Be helpful as best you can, mayor and council, as they move forward with a prospective development. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker.Mr. Mayor. Honorary Council members. My name is Charles Lu. I'm here representing third wave. I just wanted to say collectively to everybody, thank you. As has been mentioned a couple of times, this has been somewhat of a long process.And I just want to thank everybody for working with us and continuing to stick with us. This is a project that we've really poured our hearts into. When we first met with Councilmember.Andrews about it, he basically said, Get us jobs.And make us jobs. So we're very happy to say that we're going to come and hopefully exceed any expectation that you might have. Thank you to Mr. John Kiser for his tireless work, and thank you in general to the city of Long Beach for their support.And we look forward to being a member of this city on multiple projects for a long time. Thank you.Thank you very much. Thank you. Next speaker, please.Hi.I guess we're the third partners. I'm Gina Lerner with the Children's Clinic. And on behalf of Dr. Nicklaus, our CEO and our board members, I wanted to thank the councilmen, the Council and Mental Health America for inviting us to participate in this new endeavor.TCC has been in the city of Long Beach since 1939 and we serve over 40,000 patients. And as throughout the year we we've noticed the need for more services for the homeless and for those with suffered from mental illness.And I think this is going to be an interesting and exciting program as we model the integration between behavioral health.And primary care.So I just wanted to thank everybody and David Pilon and Mary and and also again, I think it could be a national model on how primary care and mental health can work together and taking care of our mutual patients.Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Good evening, marion city Council. Diana La Jean's as a former chair of the Disabilities Commission here in Long Beach. I'm very happy to see this project going forward, especially happy that the council is recognizing the need that mental health has for this facility, and I absolutely support it.MHRA is a great organization and I know they'll do well and rather than I know a lot of people have complained about the homeless and the there are some problems, but I think what mental health America is doing is going to help resolve those.So I do very much support the project and thank you for your empathy and and your support in the in this type of disability, because mental health issues are a disability. So thank you very much.Thank you very much. With that seeing no other see no other public comment, there is a motion and a second. Members, please cast your votes.Motion carries.Great. MHRA, congratulations. So the city. We're we're really looking forward. This is going to be a very exciting partnership. And I'm very excited about just the potential for for this site and the service. So thank you all very much.We're going to be now moving on to.Our.Next item, which is the recommendations from staff on the study session that we had around housing. So we're going to do that next. Madam Quirk, if I can have you read the update, actually, I'm sorry. Let me do consent calendar.\nReasoning:",
        "answer": "The meeting transcript is about the discussion and approval of a project involving Mental Health America of Los Angeles (MHRA), the Children's Clinic, and Third Wave Marketplace. The project involves the execution of a First Amendment to lease between the City and MHRA, increasing the city's participation in the cost of tenant improvements, and executing a lease agreement and option to purchase agreement with the County of Los Angeles. The project is aimed at providing both physical and behavioral health care to some of the most vulnerable people in the city of Long Beach, those who have a serious mental illness and are also at risk of homelessness or actually homeless.Therefore, the summary of the meeting transcripts is:\nRecommendation to authorize City Manager, or designee, to execute a First Amendment to Lease Number 34078 (Lease) between the City of Long Beach (City) and Mental Health America of Los Angeles (MHA), to increase the amount of City participation in the cost of tenant improvements at the City-owned premises located at 1955-1965 Long Beach Boulevard (Premises) from $1,200,000 to $3,450,000, and broaden the scope of allowed uses to include seismic renovation, improvements to the remainder of the building and additional parking;\n\nAuthorize City Manager, or designee, to execute a Lease Agreement and Option to Purchase Agreement with the County of Los Angeles, and a Sub-Lease between the City and MHA, for property located at 1945 Palmer Court to be used for parking at a cost of $222,200 over ten years;\n\nIncrease appropriations in the General Fund (GF) in the Citywide Activities Department (XC) by $2,422,200, offset by City funds received from the sale of City-owned property at 227 Elm Avenue and from sale of former Redevelopment Agency-owned parcels for transfer to the Capital Projects Fund"

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\n11 eyes. Council Resolution 1356 has been adopted. The next item up is Council Resolution 1416. Councilwoman Ortega, would you please put Resolution 1416 on the floor for adoption and remove the Council Resolution 20 1416 be adopted. Thank you.It's been moved and seconded. Questions or comments by members of Council. Councilwoman Sawyer. You're good. All right. I tried to make sure I.Got about 15 screens happening here. Give me just 1/2. Let me pull up my next screen. Thanks so much.Hang on.No worries.There we go. Okay. Thanks so much for your patience. I really appreciate that. So I called this out for a vote because I'm going to be a no vote tonight. I spoke to Chief Fulton and David Foster of 858 tonight.And we talked through my reasons, which are mostly just consistency. I'm incredibly grateful for all that our firefighters do and the relationship that we have with them. And I don't mean to belittle or demean that in any way.And I want to thank every single one of the brave individuals that our fire department in our fire department for putting their lives on the line for our community. However, just like the Police Protective Union contract, this ammo you includes raises.And given the city's financial status, I just can't support that. While I recognize that this is a different circumstance because Local 858 was already owed raises under the terms of their contract, I'm just not comfortable giving one set of employees raises while others see pay cuts during an unprecedented financial and public health crisis.Council staff and Denver's career service employees were furloughed this year, and they'll be furloughed again next year. And let's be honest, a furlough is a pay cut. All members of this council, except one give back, are raises and salaries for those furlough days in solidarity with our coworkers.And I will commit to doing that again next year. But no raises means no raises. And so in the interest of fairness and on principle and consistency, I cannot support this MRU. Just like I did not support the pay contract.So I'm going to be a no vote tonight on this and I just wanted to go on record as saying that. Thanks so much, Madam President.All right.Thank you, Councilman Sawyer. Councilman Herndon.Thank you, Madam President. In just I will be in support of this, and I'm going to remind my colleagues that this is a different set of circumstances than with the pay of the sheriff's, because Local eight five did not have to come forward to renegotiate.But recognizing the fiscal challenges that they that the city is in, they wanted to be a partner in and recognizing that they wanted to as well make some sacrifices. And so I applaud them for doing that. If we vote this down, then their current contract will remain in effect and the current contract will give them a salaryincrease next year. And we will lose the savings that we're going to get with this contract if we approve it tonight. So once again, thank those eight, five eight for coming forward. And I certainly hope my colleagues to support this today, as I will.Thank you, Madam President.Thank you, Councilman Herndon. Madam Secretary, roll call.Sawyer? No. Torres. I. Black I. CdeBaca. I, Clark.I.Flynn.I.Herndon.I.Hines.I.Cashman. I can each. I. Ortega.I.Sandoval. I. Madam President.I. Madam Secretary, close the voting and announce the results.One name. 12 eyes.12 eyes. Council Resolution 1416 has been adopted. The next item up is Council Bill 1364. Councilwoman Torres, please go ahead with your questions on Council Bill 1364.Thank you so much, Madam President. Perhaps Lauren Harvey is in the queue. Yes. Hi, Loren. So I just wanted to go through a couple of the questions. I was able to email you these earlier so you get a sense of what they were going to be.But because we didn't get to see this come through committee, because it was over the holiday week, I just I had questions about what's been spent so far in terms of rental and eviction assistance and how DHS is distributing this money.And additionally, what does DHS consider to be eviction assistance?Thank you so much, Councilman Torres, and I do appreciate you sharing some of your questions ahead of time. So pertaining to our general assistance program. Within that bucket, the amount of funding that has been spent on the evictions and rental assistance through October of 2020 is $625,131.And we did see a sharp uptick, especially in September and October, which we believe has to do with some COVID related issues. And we anticipate that continuing through November and December, which is why we wanted to request the supplemental to get out as much assistance as possible to folks.We also we do have that broken out into a few different specific assistance under that. But to your question, the way that it's paid out is through direct payments to the landlord in those cases when it's a rental or eviction assistance for a rental.And can you remind me of what your last question was? Sorry about that.Right. How DHS is distributing both the rental and eviction assistance. So kind of the procedural process that you all go through.Sure. So by ordinance, this is meant to be shorter term assistance. So basically we take applications and we look at it through some of our qualifications. So the income qualifications as well as if it's something where the person would be requesting assistance on a short term basis.So the duration by ordinance is for no longer than 90 days of assistance. So it's really a short term assistance for that person. And we also look at if they have, they also have to like show us that they don't have other means of paying for whatever the need is.And if for some reason they are not necessarily qualifying for this particular assistance. We do work closely with partners and other agencies. We work closely with TrueCar to try to connect folks to where they might be able to get further assistance.And is that answering your question about how we get this out?It is. It is. And I guess I'm just I just want to make sure I'm understanding is are the recipients of the funding already signed up for benefits through Denver Human Services or new people walking in the door explicitly for this funding?Just trying to distinguish this portal from that through a portal.I'm sure. So I could ask for that data. I don't know if we. To be honest, I don't know if we ask when somebody applies, if they are receiving other benefits. However, I'm not aware that we disqualify somebody for this assistance just because they might be receiving other benefits.But I can just double check with our folks, if that's a question we ask if they're receiving other benefits. But I'm I'm not I'm not aware that that disqualifies somebody.At this juncture for this assistance. Okay. Thank you, Lauren. Appreciate it. Thank you, Madam President.All right. Thank you, Councilman Torres. That concludes the items to be called out. All bills for introduction are ordered published. Council members remember this is a consent or block vote and you will need to vote. Otherwise, this is your last chance to call out an item for a separate vote.\nReasoning:",

We do have one item for separate consideration this evening, so we will now vote on final consideration of Council Bill $19 002 for repealing the sunset date of the cannabis consumption pilot program. Councilman Flynn, will you please put Council Bill 19 Dash 0024 on the floor?Certainly. Mr. President, I move that council bill 19, dash 24 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.It has been moved and seconded. Are there any questions or comments by members of Council or Councilman Flynn?Thank you, Mr. President. I was absent last week when this was on first reading and the public hearing was held. And I but I did go back and watch it. I missed last week's meeting just after I, my youngest son, got married and happened to choose that Tuesday for his wedding.But I did go back and watch the the testimony. And as I said in the marijuana committee, I don't believe that simply repealing the sunset, which the voters had approved, in which the authors of the initiative are included, is going to make any difference in the context of all the other changes that would have to be lookedat before this program can actually take off and have an attempt to be successful. I believe at this point now we will have only one such business open and I don't see that removing the sunset would. Result in any new businesses suddenly coming forward with all the other restrictions that I believe are truly the reason that moreof these licenses have not been sought by other businesses. I think we should solve all the problems together and move them forward as a package. I don't oppose repealing the sunset when it's part of a larger package that addresses all the other reasons that that that would need to be addressed before we could see more businesses comeforward. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Flynn. See no other questions or comments. Council members. This is just a reminder that any reform ordinance adopted by a vote of the people may be amended or repealed by city council only by a two thirds vote or nine affirmative votes instead of the standard seven affirmative votes of council are required to pass thisbill this evening.

Adoption of the resolution commending John E Russo for his service to the city of Alameda as city manager.All right, now discussion. You want to make comments?Thank you, Madam Mayor. Well, I would just like to say, and I think that many of us who know John know that, knows that he has a big personality which has enabled him to achieve some very big accomplishments in Alameda.And those were enumerated in the in the resolution and especially the conveyance of the Naval Air Station. We're going to be talking about that tonight and for some months to come. And your work with labor groups, it goes on and on.Suffice it to say that, John, you leave us better than you found us. And I know you're moving on to the city of Riverside, a much bigger city with a bigger population, bigger challenges, your equal to the task.And the city of Riverside is in good hands with you. And we'll miss you.We do have four speakers. Three have them speak at this point.Should we vote?Well, I think we're supposed to have public comment before. Actually, we do know.Well.All right. I'm going to go ahead and call the speakers Gray Harris, then Jeff Del Bono, then Helen Soares and then Dianne Lichtenstein.Good evening. I'm Greg Harris. I'm here as the co-president of the city of Alameda Democratic Club. I wanted to thank John and Alex. I'm going to do six A and B all at once in the interest of time for their service to the city of Alameda.I was formerly the president of the teachers union in Alameda. And during that time, the school district was going through some rocky times. The city of Alameda also went through some rocky times. And then John and Alex came.And the rocky times kind of evened out and smoothed out kind of like the school district is hopefully doing now. And now you're going to leave. So I am sad about that. But I also know that Riverside is lucky to have you.And we really appreciate all the time and work you have spent here. Helen Source most everything's been pretty well covered, especially in the resolution. But I just wanted to reinforce see a team that John is a symbol. This fine team of professionals have brought a high standard to our city, a high standard of excellence.His knowledge of how cities work and the regulatory process and expertize and guiding careful development to enhance our city, and most especially redirecting Alameda Point from our three times, going down the same rathole and teeing the city up for success with his strong start for actual development that will strengthen our economy for years to come.Credibility and address are social needs. What a big thanks. And I wish you and Alex all the best. And thanks to both of you for being such fine team leader sitting. Good evening, Diane Liechtenstein. I am not as eloquent as little Arnie Rich or certainly as a proclamation or as Helen.But I do know all the wonderful things that have been said about John. And since he has been here, he surely has propelled our city along. And I wish him and his family all the best.Thank you, Jeff de Bono. And thank you for waiting. And then I'll be Karen, be.Mayor, council, city staff. So I have one word quitters, but I'm going to do it in the efficiency of time. Two, I'm going to combine the both A and B, and I want to thank both of both John and Alex for their service.I think everybody knows the history with the firefighters here before they came. I know that for me and for every single guy that sits in the station, and I think I can speak for every police officer on the street.John and Alex brought dignity to city hall. They brought respect. And that's what we felt in the firehouse. And that's what we felt as employees here when they got here. The collaborative process, the mutual respect, we had to open communication.And it wasn't always easy at times. I know. I know sometimes. Like I told the guys in Riverside, when you have a problem with John, sometimes you got to work through Alex to get back to John because, you know, we don't always we don't always see eye to eye, but the mutual respect that was shown brought alot back to this city. And I hope that continues forward. I think Riverside deserves deserves to have you, especially with how conservative it is down there. But I thank you again for your service. And Alex, I know that you reached out to the fire department personally and worked hand in hand with our fire chief and some ofour employees, such as Jim Colburn, and really put the effort and time. And I don't know how to thank you guys. It meant a lot to us. It means a lot to us. And I think we've accomplished some great things here.I hope we can accomplish other great things that's unprecedented in the state of California in the future. Meetings coming up. But once again, thank you again, both of you guys. I consider you guys friends and thank you very much for your service.Evan Bayh.Hmm. That evening, Madam Mayor, the city council and Mr. Russo. I'm so glad that I didn't miss this part. I just wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. You have been, I think, one of the best city managers we've ever had.And I can say that because when we took on the role as master developer, I really don't think we understood exactly what we were accepting. But you made it seem easy. You know, you knew just what we had to do.You knew how to negotiate the deals. You knew how to keep us moving forward. And that's what I'm used to. I've worked for developers for 15 years. And you have been an incredible developer. And I appreciate all of your hard work.And we're going to miss you. I'm going to miss you. And I wish you the best. Thank you.Thank you. Counsel comments. The other memory.And just want to echo a lot of what the public said. And I was having a conversation with a constituent earlier today, and she said to me, is it typical that we give proclamations and recognize outgoing city managers as like, well, it's not often that we have won leave voluntarily in recent times.So that's that's what was my first thought. But my second thought was, you know, it's not it's not often we're blessed with somebody of John's talents and skills here in Alameda. I remember talking to the then vice mayor four years ago when I first learned that you were interested in doing this job.And my apologies to Mr. Arnovitz. You know, my first comment was, well, if you can get Michael Jordan to come play for your team at his peak, then that's what you should do. And I think that's what we did.And not only do we get Michael Jordan to the Chicago Bulls reference, I'm sorry, that's where I'm from. Not only do we get Michael Jordan, we got Scottie Pippen with him. So we had an amazing team. And, you know.I'm so glad that I'm sitting in the seat now and not four years ago, because you've turned around the morale at City Hall. You've turned around. Now there's labor peace, which is very important, and you've turned around the city finances.And I'm really going to miss you, man. Wish you were here, but I know we're in good hands, so thanks.Member, De Saag.Thank you very much. Several days ago, on April 19th, the city of Alameda celebrated its 161 year, having been founded in April 19th, 1854. I think over that time, Mr. Russo and his tenure as city manager will stand out as one of the best, in my opinion.He took a city that was in disarray and put us in the right direction, not just internally within the walls of City Hall, but externally in terms of how we work with the community and how we work on major projects like Alameda Point, which was long stalled.I think history will be kind to Mr. Russo and also the city council's that he worked with Mayor Gilmore or Mayor Chris Spencer. And I think for your time here and also Mr. Nguyen's time here, Alameda is the much richer and I think your place in art in the chapters of it as is city hall.History is certainly going to be a good chapter.Assistant City Manager Liz Wormley. Did you want to be vice mayor? Sorry.I just wanted to say, I hope people understand just how difficult the job is. Appreciate. Your energy to that. And I wish you the absolute best in Riverside, and I hope you enjoy it.This one right now.Thank you, Madam Mayor. First, I'd just like to invite everybody tomorrow to our going away party that we're hosting for both Alex and John at the Elks from 5 to 7 p.m.. And we have some special treats for them.But everybody is invited. I also just wanted to say that, you know, 17 years ago I worked here as management analyst, as one where where I started my career in California. And and I left to go on to bigger, better things.And I always had an eye coming back to Alameda because I always lived I continued to live in Alameda, but there was never really an opportunity that I saw where I really wanted to be part of a team until I saw that John actually took the helm.And when I realized that he was here, it was an organization that I really wanted to be part of. And he has not let me down. John has brought transparency and accountability to city hall and accountability. And I really want to emphasize that.You know, in cities we have a. Employees, long time employees. And sometimes it's hard for us to accomplish the tasks that we want to accomplish. John brought that accountability to City Hall that I really have not witnessed in cities that I've worked with, and I've been in cities for 25 years.One of the things that people don't realize about John, I think everybody thinks he came from a large city and he had the large city mentality, but at his core, he really cared about the individual, the small guy.Oftentimes when we would talk about business transactions or with developers, he was always the hardest on the developers, on the people that had the big pocketbook. But on the little guy, on the small business, on the person who was trying to pull a permit, he always if he could cut not cut corner corners, because we're not allowedto do that. But that was his mentality was was to go after the big folks and actually do what he could and bend over backwards for the average citizen. And, you know, that's just I don't think people really realize that.And that's such a such a great gift. And and just I'd like to acknowledge him for that. I just want to say I'm really going to miss you, John and Alex both. Let me say a few words about Alex.It's hard to be to work with John. I think you all can imagine as a council member, Ashcraft has said, as he Ashcraft has said, you know, John has a big personality and. We've got Alex, who is sort of part of that partnership.And I think it's been Alex has always been at his side and has always provided, I think, to our staff council, the perspective of the average citizen. How would our decisions that we make here at City Hall affect the average citizen?And has really brought a perspective, I think, that really is unique to City Hall. So, Alex, I want to say thank you to you, to both of you. I wish you the best of luck. We're really going to miss you.And I'll do my best to fill your shoes. But as I'm sure everybody knows, they're quite big shoes to fill. I will do my best. And again, good luck.And I want to say a few words for those of you who don't know. When I was on the school board, I had the pleasure of working with Mr. Russo. We would regularly have joint meetings and he was always professional.And then during the campaign, very gracious and afforded really me every opportunity to learn what the city was about. He always took the time to to answer questions. And now, with the transition again, always professional. And I truly respect you as your work.And then you personally, what you bring to the table. I wish you and your family absolutely the best. And it really has been a benefit to our city to have you serve. And now we will vote all those in favor.I.Oppose.Motion carries.Unanimously.

Vice mayor, members of the City Council in order for the city to provide possible Internet service function to local businesses. The Technology and Innovation Department is proposing a limited one year pilot program to provide broadband services are commonly known as lift services.This proposed lease agreement under the pilot program would provide these services to famous Dave's Long Beach. As the initial participant lists, services are including the provision and equipment installation, the management and support of all services that are required to provide high speed Internet access.These lift services will allow FEMA's Steve to receive the high speed Internet connectivity while sharing the same conduit as the city's municipal fiber. We are completely segregated. Segregated, and the city networks do not pose any risk for any type of security breach.Famous Dave's was primarily chosen for this because of their inability to obtain high speed Internet services from other providers. Also, the proximity of unused city fiber and a minimal cost for the city to configure it. Install the proper equipment on Fima Stephen's premises.With that, I'm open to any questions.Thank you for that. I wanted to ask just a basic question, but why don't major internet service providers provide service to that location? That is the Pike Circle. And there's a tremendous amount of enterprise going on there. So I'm a little surprised.Do we have an answer to that?That's that's a very good question you think would be very profitable. But we do not know why they do not, you know.Interesting. Okay. And then. Are there other pockets similar to this in the city?Yes, we are looking at other areas that could potentially benefit from a municipal run, fiber and connectivity. That's part of an assessment that we are taking. And as the infrastructure the city grows, it could be potential openings for other people to join in on this pilot.Okay. And sorry. I don't mean to appear startled. I'm just a little surprised that that that exists. But are there any assessments during the pilot phase of reassessing anything during this phase?Primarily for us. It's making sure that we have the capability to provide that type of service. We are bringing an additional capacity to our current broadband access and then we're bringing that over to them. So if it's something that we're able to maintain and that they can use efficiently, then that shows that it's been a successful initiationand something we would want to grow from there.Okay. Thank you. Thank you for that. And I wanted to mention and he's not here in the audience, but Mr. Schneider, Kurt Schneider, who's the owner of Famous Dave's. I'd like to thank him and his team for being as diligent as they had been in their efforts to get Internet service to their restaurant and hopefully eventually tothe rest of Pike's Circle. It was quite a surprise for me and my staff to find out that. That was a black hole of sorts for connectivity. So Curt came to our office sometime ago and presented the lack of service and the great need to get it somehow soon.While I realize he was speaking specifically for his establishment, I do think opening up this issue to the light of day gives us an opportunity to make sure that the circle is served somehow, one way or another. They have done a tremendous amount to make that a much more attractive location for all of us in Long Beachand our visitors. And so I think working on getting connectivity is something that we should do. And I know you're working on it, and I want to thank our team that has continued to try to make this happen.And I'd like to applaud you for getting us to our current position. And I'm hopeful that the outcome of this pilot will be positive and that we're able to continue moving forward. I know that a couple of councilmembers have mentioned that there are similar pockets that they're aware of.And so it's a good direction for us to move and. Councilman Gonzales.I just want to say thank you as well to Brian and his team for staying on this. I know a lot of us have been prodding and asking you about what the next steps are, so I appreciate it.Do we have a map of the fiber that we have currently? I know there's been one kind of floating around, but I don't know that we have to have a formalized map at this point.We we do have a map of where Cityfibre is currently running. What we don't know or aren't able to yet to provide is what's really available, because we're not yet to the state where we could provide this services to other parts of the city.The primary map is mainly covering areas that we do service for our own public inter or our private internet such as police substations, the ECAC, other city facilities that we would want to grow on as part of that master fiber plan to expand and then decide, is this something that the city is capable of performing and movinginto that arena in the future?Okay, great. Thank you for the clarification.All right. There's been a motion and a second. Is there any member of the public that wish to address council on 25? SINGH None. Members Cast your vote.Bass, man.Motion carries.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nI think I believe, Councilwoman Sussman, he's a constituent in your district and maybe you know him as well. And so they will proceed with now with the work of the committee. Thank you. That's all.All right. Councilman Lopez, did you want to.Yeah. Just got a great last name.Okay, that's. That's beautiful. Okay. Madam Secretary, can you please bring up Council Bill 328? Councilman Lopez?Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. So on 320, I just wanted to make this comment. For the past couple of years, the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless Association has wanted to receive funding directly from the funder as a grant moneys instead of through Denver Human Services.So DHS has decided to permit the entire funding amount of the grant to go directly to state CCH instead of DHS keeping 2% of the grant funding for administration and processing. So this amount must now be used by CCH for direct client services.The $35,170 increase in the contract is the 2% difference that CCH will now receive for direct client services. So, you know, I wanted to I mean, because there is that difference in that question had had popped up earlier today.I just wanted to clarify it and go on the record of doing that. DHS will remain the recipient of the grant, but will pass through the entire amount of the grant to CCH.Okay. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilman Flynn, were you up next or can each.I will. Thank you, Mr. President. This raises a couple of questions in my mind, because when this went through committee, I believe it was about consent. Chairman Mr. Chairman.I believe so strongly.So usually when the amount of the contract changes, there has to be a new filing number and we have to do an amendment. But the way I understand this, we didn't actually change the amount in the contract. It was just incorrect in the description we were given.And, Mr. President, it's a problem for me when we when we're looking at things on consent and looking at the descriptions and we don't have the full body of the contract yet to understand that that's not the amount of money that we approved.So I do have a couple of questions on this, but I don't know if anybody is here from Human Services who can.Oh, yeah. We have Ron here.Hello. Way in the back.Good evening. I'm Ron Mitchell with Human Services.Hi, Ron. Why why are we changing the policy and how how long is that 2% been in place?Well, that 2% has been in place for quite some time. I don't have the exact number of years, but traditionally we have taken about 2% out. It's often been a little bit less than that to administer that the grant and that means the processing of it as well as the monitoring of it that we do that thetime that it went to Mayor Council, there were negotiations essentially underway to make a determination of what we should do with the Housing First grant should it go entirely to the vendor who has been receiving the vast majority of it, which is Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, or should the city retain it?And the decision ultimately was made that the city would retain that.So the question I have is why then was it a mayor council if we were still negotiating it, why we put the cart before the horse?Well, part of that.Would have been nice if we had known this.Yes, Councilman, part of that is that there have been sometimes delays and being able to reimburse some of our vendors with these federal contracts or the federal grants, rather, the federal grants do allow backdating so that we can catch up.And so they actually because they are really inconsistent about delivering the funds. And so part of that was that the contract administrator wanted to try to move that through. What I had failed to do as one set negotiation had terminated was to update you all with the changes that were were made this afternoon.Yes. The contract administrator noticed that the amount was different than what was in the contract.Okay, I'm glad you caught it right before our meeting. But who is going to pay the processing fees and administration now? Are they not do we not have costs on this contract or are we going to have to cover that elsewhere?Otherwise we do have to cover it. Essentially, we are going to have expenses associated with the contract, obviously with processing it and monitoring it. But the decision was made that to pass those funds through so that there was more service dollars available in the contract to the vendor.So are we changing this for all such contracts now?Not at this point.Why this one?This one came to the attention of, I believe, council some of the council members that were approached by Colorado Coalition for the Homeless. And they had they had been advocating for at least a couple of years to receive the grant directly.And my understanding is that it was basically a negotiation that that did allow the city to retain the grant so that we can ensure that those funds are directed how we want them directed in line with our goals around Denver's Road Home and the Office of Hope.Mm hmm. And did we also change the scope of services? Did we add to the scope?Only in as much as the 2% was now passed through directly to them with again, not having them use those funds for administration of of the grant of the funds. But but to go to direct services. So that was the in negotiation.So is this a one time decision.For this for this grant? This is expected to be ongoing.For this grant. Right. But for other providers, will we be doing the same thing?Not that I'm aware of at this point.I have a feeling Councilwoman Canisius buzzed in after me. And I have a feeling if she had gone first, I could have taken less time. So let me let me pass. Mr. President, I.Think that is wise counsel and can each.Know no expectations. Right. Well, thank you, Mr. President. And, you know, thank you to the department. I did want to chime in, because this is a contract that I did ask some questions about. And I think that like many contracts, it's not I mean, I don't want to throw the administration under the bus, but they often fileaudience requests while they're still finishing the text of the contract. It happens all the time. So that's actually not unique to this contract. We can debate another day whether that's a good or bad practice, but the goal is to keep things moving often so that either services continue occurring without interruption in work so that small businesses, nonprofitsaren't expected to operate without being paid. So those are the the trade offs that we have. And, you know, I, for one, understand that there's a public interest in keeping things moving and not waiting until all of the ink is dry and every provision to file.But but I hear the concerns about this coming down to the wire. So the two things I guess I want to add is I think this this grant is a little different. You mentioned that they get the vast majority of the funds, but there are no other subcontractors and there haven't been any subcontractors for many years.Right now, this is an example of where in the past it's my understanding that this grant had to go to local government. It couldn't go to nonprofits. Is that is that accurate? So but the federal government changed that rule.So here's the question. What if. You know, we we talk a lot about efficiency in our city, you know, so sometimes we have to accept money from the government and pass it on to providers, because that's the rule in this case.There is a very clear set of criteria for this grant. There is one applicant who does who does that work, who manages these tenant vouchers. It has been the same contractor for many years, and they could, in theory, get this directly.They could, yes.So the question becomes, how do we justify to the public that it's running through us and that we're taking money off the top that isn't going to rental vouchers? So that's that's one compelling public interest question, right. In terms of the substance of the change.The second thing I would say in terms of why I think it you know, I support the administration's decision to proceed rather than killing the bill and starting over is because it's my understanding we've had some concerns with timeliness of our own processing of payments.It hasn't just been federal payments. That's correct. Okay. And so when that happens, we have a nonprofit who's left trying to cover the costs. And in perhaps cases, we might be in violation of some federal standards.Yes, we when these grants come in again, they often, especially in the last 5 to 7 years, have become and very inconsistently ever since the Great Recession. And what we're able to do is, is we have some funds that the city council has approved of that allows us to cover those costs for vendors and to pay theirinvoices prior to actually receiving the federal funds this year, the grant came in more timely than before, but that that has been an issue for many of our nonprofits. And so with City Council's permission, we've been able to keep those services flowing, as you had mentioned, without interruption, by having a special fund that covers those costs untilthe federal funding comes in.Yeah, and I don't want to call the vendor out because again, I think this is one of those sensitive topics, but I think that the vendor would state that they are still not receiving timely payments in many cases.So there is there is a genuine dispute here between parties and I think so. So I guess to just narrow it down, this is more my comment than my question, which is that two things. One, where there is no argument as to the fact that this is the sole provider of these services, it's not appropriate for usto carve money off the top just for it to flow through us. The money should go to the folks who need it, which in this case are homeless individuals who need rental vouchers. And so to the extent that we may incur some administrative costs in passing that money through, I think that that's a fair trade for thefact that we've had some timeliness of payment issues, which I'm sure has cost the vendor on the other side. So if you consider that any good contract involves, you know, something on each side, we may be eating a few administrative costs for passing through, but they've been eating costs for our delays.So in the in this case, I will just close by saying this. I'm going to support this contract this year. At this time, I think it's a you know, it's a tough confluence of factors. But I think it's important that we look at, again, what the compelling policy cases for not just allowing this grant to flow directly. It is a very defined scope of services. We couldn't use these funds to build housing. We couldn't use these funds to do other things. So there's a very limited scope the federal government provides. And so the case that we have to pass through them, I think bears more discussion.And I hope that I hope that the city and the department and the and the partners. I can talk more about that so that next year you can kind of make a good case to us. If it's this narrow scope and we don't really have any say over how it's done, what's the justification for for all ofthis? Because it does cause delays in terms of clients getting their their services. So with that, I'll be supporting it today. Thanks.Councilman Flint. You wanna.Thank you? Yes, my friend. Just a quick follow up, then. Councilwoman, are there other raises the question this this contract went through on consent eight weeks ago. And so there's been a lot of time elapsed. And to have a change like this on the floor or actually about an hour before is disconcerting.So I'm wondering if it might be time to sit down, maybe in council and Chair Lopez's committee in Safety and housing. And homelessness prevention to discuss the process and try to keep it more linear. Instead of reaching back and making changes and and telling us about them here, it might work out a little better.So. So, Councilman Flynn, are you proposing that we pass this bill and we for it and we go back and we have a conversation about future bills?Yes, I do. I have no I have no desire to hold it up. Yeah. Today, I'm just trying to understand when. When I'm.In last.Minute pitches come at.Us. Yeah, I'm in favor of that. I think the public it's important. The public should know this is for 240 units. Right. Rental assistance for homeless individuals. So we want to get this money on the street as soon as possible.So I'm glad I'm in favor of that. Councilwoman.I just want to say I support the bill, but I also support the conversation about the fact that we really do need to have a broader conversation, not just on human services, but on contracts in general, because all too often we don't get complete information.And, you know, when we look at the the documents that are filed there, the contracts aren't there. We don't see the level of detail that we get only when we ask questions. And so I think it's important for us and in I'll remind you that our procedures were changed that basically removed one week out of our processto be able to review documents. So we moved contracts now to two resolutions where we get to see them just one time. And so the fact that we're not getting complete information at the last minute, we're having to make scrambled phone calls to agency staff.I think it's a bigger conversation that we need to have. I would suggest maybe we do it in an operations meeting to figure out what, you know, where do we want to go with that?Yeah, it sounds like two different issues. This this contract in particular in the future, which Councilman Lopez, I'm sure you're okay to bring in your committee and then operations. We can have a conversation around in general the information that we're receiving in all these contracts.All right. Okay. Councilman Espinosa. Yeah, I just want to sort of chime in. Wherever that ends up the subsequent conversation, I don't I think that whether the money can go or he can or cannot, I mean, it can go directly, but there's always an avenue for government oversight or something.I mean, again, we're not talking specifically to that fund. I don't think in general we should be afraid of taking on some level of responsibility, considering how many funds go to this particular provider and all of our providers.I mean, Human Services has a role to play in the administration because we have seen previously in this council what happens when when we just defer that responsibility to the providers. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you, Ron. Okay. We're going to move on to Resolution 500.\nReasoning:",

Mr. President, we had a productive and informative hearing yesterday on the stock docket, and I was joined by counsel of Counsel Braden, as well as Joe CORNISH and Rosanne Foley from the Boston Landmark Commission.This is a preservation restriction agreement between a property and the village, which I proudly represent in the historic and historic New England, which is an agreement that outlines what the property can and cannot do in order to preserve its historic elements.This agreement needs to go through city and state to get approval in order for it to be rendered perpetual. This is a private agreement, and once it's approved, the historic details of the property will be preserved and protected.And if there are renovations needed, the owner would need to get approval from historic New England and the Bay Village Historic District Commission. This property was constructed in the 1840s, and this agreement will preserve its preserve its exterior staircase, interior details, fireplace and other features.This is a great way to preserve some of our city's historic properties, and it is supported by all parties involved. I also want to thank and acknowledge Consalvo and her staff. I hope that we can vote to approve this preservation restriction agreement today.Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you very much. The chair recognizes the district councilor from Beacon Hill. Councilor Kenzie Bach. The floor is yours on docket 0849.Thank you so much, Mr. President. And thank you to everyone for your indulgence. Although this is not in my district, I feel, I think is the only daughter of Bay Village ever to serve on this body. And that I just wanted to say a word about why I'm so excited about this.It's four doors down from the house I grew up in. And, you know, I think a lot of folks don't know that Bay Village was very much built into the name Bay Village like back Bay. It's on Phil and it was when it was first built, it was very much a tradesperson neighborhood and it was inhabited byand these are smaller houses, many of the people who were building the grand mansions of the back bay. And so you have Bay Village kind of come in in the 1830s, 1840s, and then when the back bay gets filled in and you have those buildings in the 1860s seventies, this is really an artisan neighborhood.And so a lot of the interior features that a preservation restriction like this is going to protect are the kinds of hallmarks of that sort of tradesperson housing, smaller rooms like sort of functional approach that often goes kind of unnoticed when again, we focus only on the kind of grand mansions.And there's also some pretty cool built history here. If everyone looks on the very back of the packet, this passageway that runs between two of the buildings, these run along Melrose Street between a bunch of the buildings. And you can see stairs because shortly after they built the neighborhood, it started flooding and they realized they needed toraise the street. And so they actually they actually raised this the street like, I think six or even ten feet and then kept these sunken gardens in the back. And so as a result, there's like a kind of floors worth of difference between the back and the front of the houses.So I just think, you know, it's some it's important it's some important hidden history in the city. And this really does reflect private leadership, both the owner deciding to go for this preservation restriction and historic there and then being willing to steward it.So I do think that the least we can do as the public body that won't be responsible for enforcing it is to give it our go ahead in this moment so strongly endorse the chair and the chair pro tempore is here.So thank you.Thank you very much. Would anyone else wish to speak on docketed 0849 saying no takers? Councilor Michel Wu, chair of the Committee on Planning, Development, Transportation, as well as Councilor Flynn and Councilor Box.

Council President Pro Tem Colleagues Council Bill 120233 is Seattle City Lights Proactive Policy to protect ratepayers from increased charges by adjusting its rate stabilization account. The Rate Stabilization Account was created by the Council so City Light would have a reserve to buffer ratepayers from the ups and downs of the wholesale power market.Revenue put into the RSA from sales on that market during high water flow periods is a major factor in the utility's ability to avoid raising rates during prior times of the year when the utility has to buy power to meet customer needs.However, the weather does not always cooperate, as the summary in fiscal note indicates. In early 2021, the outlook for the same strong and no surcharge was expected to come back on within the next year. However, dry hydro conditions, combined with exceptionally hot weather and high wholesale market prices, quickly depleted the RSA balance during the third quarter.Council 4120233 does two things. It moves money from another account city light into the RSA to avoid adding a 3% surcharge to the customers bills. And it simplifies the RSA structure to make surcharges a less frequent occurrence.

This tradition of supporting community aquatics and the new pool will most assuredly reintroduce Long Beach to the national and international swimming community. However, to reinforce the pool's image, the Belmont Pools image, as a citywide asset that all of our residents feel connected to and proudof, we believe the city should make it easier for our youth to swim at Belmont and every pool, for that matter. As the so-called aquatic capital of America and a city committed to being a healthy community and certainly our brothers keepers, it is in our best interest to encourage our young residents to become lifelong swimmers no mattertheir economic, cultural or geographic status. And for these reasons, council members, I urge an eye vote from you. Thank you, Mr. Mayor.Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce.Thank you, Vice Mayor Lowenthal, for bringing this forward. I have said repeatedly in the Belmont Pool discussions that I started participating in in June and have been very actively involved in until today, that I want the Belmont Pool and of course, any other facility we have in the center but in the city, but especially the Belmont Pool, to be a facility that every child in the city feels is theirs, regardless of it being in the third district, I want every child and family in this city to feel that this pool is their city pool and that they are welcome here and that there is no encumbrance to them being able to use the pool suchas a financial one. So I think this is a wonderful item and I encourage my council colleagues to support it as well.Q Councilmember Andrews.Yes, thank you, Mayor. I want to thank our Councilwoman Lowenthal for bringing me in on this also, because as we find out, a lot of in our cities, a lot of times the dollar doesn't sound like a lot.But when you have a family for a dollar an awful lot and I know, you know a Kings Park, we have a problem, you know, just with the kids being able to afford to go to the pool there.So, you know, like I said, I think that this is one of the great things because it provides fun and challenging ways our children stay fit. You know, one is swimming is probably one of the most athletic, you know, challenges that you'll go through.So I always my favorite saying is my kids, they are tired, kid is a good kid. And that will definitely keep them in good shape and keep him out of trouble. Thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.I want to thank you for bringing forward this motion. I think involving our youth in our community and specifically in swimming at a young age is a great resource for our community. And I support this idea.Thank you. Members, please go ahead and cast your vote.Bush and Kerry eight term.Thank you.

        "answer": "The meeting transcript is about a communication from Vice Mayor Sudhir Lowenthal, Councilwoman Susie Price, and Councilman Andrews with three recommendations. The recommendations are about making city pools more accessible to youth, expanding the summer fund program, and exploring the possibility of a dedicated bus service to and from Belmont Pool. The council members discuss the importance of these recommendations and their potential benefits to the community.Therefore, the summary of the meeting transcripts is:\nRecommendation to request that all youth under the age of seventeen (17) be admitted to Belmont Pool and other city pools for $1;\r\n\r\nRequest City Manager report back on the costs to expand the Summer Fun program to include youth from other community centers throughout the City if the demand is there, therefore, increasing the number of kids that can use the Belmont pool for free; and\r\n\r\nRequest further that City Manager explore with Long Beach Transit the possibility of a special bus or buses dedicated solely to taking people to and from Belmont pool similar to Los Angeles and Foothill Transit buses that take people to area beaches."

Any other questions or comments? All right. That was not called out. So we will go to the SEC. Go to the next one, which is bills for final consideration, which I believe, Madam Secretary. The first one was 620, caught out by Councilwoman Fox.What would you like for us to do with this, Councilwoman?Please put it on the floor for a vote.Certainly will. Councilman Brooks, would you please have 620 place on the floor for final consideration?Certainly, Mr. President, I put Council Bill 620 on the floor for final consideration and do pass.It has been moved and seconded. Comments. Councilwoman Fox.Thank you, Mr. President. This is the creation of an affordable housing funding mechanism. If you believe Denver should be funding affordable workforce housing, the fund is structured well. So my problem, my problems are not with the structure of the fund.My problem is that it has already been stated that the intention is to ask for general general fund money to go into it. Now, last year, general fund money was appropriated with the idea that a fund would be created.And at that time, I had thought I had a compromise with the administration that it would be a one time funding mechanism. And in fact, they are the ones that described it as one time. And now here we go again.So that that's a problem for me. If this is going to be a mechanism that just continually siphons general fund money off by using general fund people who earn less, like many of the people in my area will be seeing their city taxes siphoned off for housing for people who actually earn more than they do.Remember workforce housing. We're not talking about homeless. We're not talking about the poor, such as the Denver Housing Authority serves. We are talking about workforce housing. And I am not willing to short city services that people think they're paying for in order to siphon the money to an affordable housing fund for workforce housing, which the city hasshown it can put on some of the highest real estate in this city. So I will be voting no.Thank you. Councilwoman Foster. Any other comments from members of council? Seeing Madam Secretary role go.But no.Carnage. Layman Lopez Montero I nevett i.

Madam Secretary, I think the last one was Council Bill 629 called out by Councilwoman Ortega. That will not come to a question. Go right ahead.I don't know if we have someone here from our city's asset office sky. Can you help answer a question? So I don't know what the zoning is on this property. I know exactly where the parcel is and I'm just trying to figure out what it is that the buyer plans to do with the property.Do we have any idea?Lisa Lumley from Real Estate is not here this evening, but I'll have her get back to you. I think she has had conversations with the purchaser about what their intention is, but I do not recall that off the top of my head.Okay. Mr. President, I will vote for its passage. Well, it's it some final.It is.Mr. President, if I may. I'm sorry.Go ahead, Councilman.So I chaired a committee that this came through on consent, and I was actually going to ask Councilwoman Sheppard, this is in her district, and she did a little due diligence on it before we put it on consent.And I don't want to put you on the spot, Councilwoman Sheppard, but you may be able to answer the question. And if not, we can certainly.Thank you, Councilman. Can each councilman I tell you what I recall in the discussion was I was concerned about the historic property that is part of this parcel. And so I was asking what was going to happen to the historic property there.And I was not told what the larger redevelopment was, but I was told that the developer would continue to keep the historic property that it's there and incorporate it into the overall development. But I did not learn what the larger redevelopment was.So we don't know if it's a mixed use or if it's just housing or if it's going to be commercial.I don't know that at this time.Okay. I would appreciate hearing from our real estate office to learn more about what is proposed on the site.We'll get you that information here.All right. That was all of them, I believe. And I'll just quickly look up and down. I believe we got them all. So we are now ready for the block votes. All of the bills for introduction are ordered published.Councilman Brooks, will you please put the resolutions on the floor for adoption?Why, certainly, Mr. President, I put the following bills on the floor for resolution to be adopted in a block.

Councilman Clark?Yeah. I just wanted to also chime in and say thank you so much for your service, especially when it comes to our park ranger program. This is just an incredible asset to our city. These park rangers are out in our beloved parks and doing really hard work with people who get angry with them.And I have seen personally so many times them just be calm in the face of yelling people and really help make sure that all of our parks are safe and enjoyable for everyone. I can't imagine our city and our park system without this Ranger program.And so I just wanted to add my. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Clark. Councilman Lopez.I also wanted to just chime in on the thank you's and congratulations. Thank you for the hard work. I actually am very thrilled you are here in the council chambers celebrating and the proclamation. And not because I had a six pack at Barnum Park not too long ago.I was like, God, I swear to God, we drank that all medium and put it in. I'm just kidding. It's keeping you on your toes, man. No, I. It's. The Park Ranger program is so important in our city, and you all help keep the peace in our parks, help keep them pristine, but also help educate people onwhat the rules are and and what we can and can't do to our parks. And also because our parks are so historic. However old or however new they are, there are places for everybody and there are places for community gather and you all are the faces.And you all served this city with such with such dignity and with such hard work and honor. And I think it's it's fitting and congratulations and thank you so much for your service.Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman Ortega.Mr. President, I'd like to have my name added. And I just wanted to say, do we have Happy Haines here in the audience? Happy served on this city council. And back then we used to have parks police. It was before we had Parks Rangers and, you know, a lot a lot changes in the city.But I think the fact that we do have park rangers is so important, especially, you know, not just in the city, but in our mountain parks as well. And not long ago, a number of us had an opportunity to go do a tour of our mountain parks.And the amount of land that we have in our mountain communities is pretty, pretty massive. And so to be able to cover all that ground and deal with some of the challenges and issues that come up, I think is is important.I know that involves a lot of interface with Jefferson County where most of that land is located. But I just wanted to say, David, thank you for your 19 plus years of service and really appreciate your dedication and commitment to the city and just wish you Godspeed in in your retirement.Thanks.Thank you.

Don't suppose there's somebody you'd like to invite to the podium to receive the proclamation?Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to invite a Denver Parks and Rec leadership, along with Mr. David Stewart.So I just wanted to say a quick word. So, David. David has been huge for me. I mean, I've been in this job about four years, and I learned very quickly that when he's not the person you call, when something's going right, you call it when something is going wrong.And I'll tell you what. Not once did I ever call him, and he did not pick up his phone. He was always there for me, and he always gave me the sage advice. He kept he just kept things on the right track.And he made sure that I was doing making sure I was doing the things right and correctly, to make sure that we kept people out of trouble and we made sure that we were following protocol. As as Councilwoman Ortega mentioned, you know, we had an amazing mountain parks tour.And and on that great adventure, we had a little mishap on the way back to Denver on Sixth Avenue. And I'll tell you what, the first person I called was Dave Stewart. And I'll tell you what. Within 15 minutes, he was out there on Sixth Avenue helping us deal with that situation and taking care of business.So it is true. It is totally true. Dave created the park ranger program in 1999. He decided, we need a park ranger program. And it is true that when he started the program for at least the first month, he took his bike and he strapped it to the front of RTD bus and went around to Parks andand basically was our first park ranger. So I want our park rangers to stand up. I just want you to know, if it wasn't for Dave, we would not have a park ranger program. We probably have around 30 park rangers in the city of Denver right now.And to think that he was he did this and he envisioned this is pretty amazing. So I want to actually acknowledged Janet, his friend that's here. And thank you for coming. And all of our park staff has come to definitely recognize David because he's been a huge part of our department.So I do want Bob Tall to come up and say a few words.Good evening. I'm real proud to stand up here and to recognize Dave for his years of service. And I feel very honored to be part of the ceremony tonight to help congratulate him on all those years of service.A lot of things have been said already. They're all true, and I really appreciate all of council's support for the program and the kind words for Dave. They're well-deserved. Dave I don't know how to say it, but Dave exemplified and yes, he does answer his phone like Scott, no matter when you call.But Dave exemplified and promoted excellence in serving park visitors and protecting park resources and the finest park system in the nation. Denver His legacy of leadership and mentoring continues to inspire all of us and including myself and is very much appreciated.I feel fortunate to work the last three and a half plus years with Dave. So Dave, on behalf of the Denver Park Ranger program, congratulations on your retirement. And I'd like to present this little badge plaque for Dave.And let me just read it to you, maybe just a little bit of background. First, we always called Dave the godfather of the program because that's that's what he was. And so this badge plaque is presented to Dave Stewart, the godfather of Denver Rangers.Thanks for all the years of dedicated service.

So the community health centers serve as a beacon of strength, service and care in their communities.And this National Health Center Week honors those frontline providers, staff and beloved patients who lost their lives during the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic. From the very beginning of the crisis, community health centers began finding groundbreaking ways to provide preventative and primary care to their patients.And we know the incredible work they did in trying to get the vaccines out. And all of the health centers do great work that I know many in East Boston and the Mattapan Health Center really came together and did great work trying to make sure that the residents were educated and had access to that.And each day of the National Community Health Center Week celebrates the work and services of health centers provide to the unique populations within their communities, and highlights the innovative solutions they produce to address the most pressing health care issues that our residents face.So I hope it be resolved that the Boston City Council recognizes August 7th through the 13th as National Community Health Centers Week, which will honor our critically important health care centers that keep our communities healthy and thriving.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThank you. That concludes consent counter. We have two hearings, as you hear them. Item number 11.Report from Development Services recommendation to receive supporting documentation under the record. Conclude the public hearing. Adopt resolution approving and certifying the Environmental Impact Addendum. Declare ordinance approving a zone change on nine lots located at 2012245 West Pacific Coast Highway and 1827 Pacific Avenue.An An ordinance approving zoning code amendment to the Midtown specific plan read for the first time and lead over to the next regular meeting of the City Council for Final Reading District six.I'd like to think.So, but I'll let the. Here and go out and start stuff.Like to introduce Christopher Coons, the deputy development services director for this item.Good evening, Mr. Mayor, vice mayor and members of the council. This evening we're talking about an important housing project in the Sixth Council District. And it's also important because this is our first project brought forward pursuant to the land use element that was approved by the council back in 2019.So with that introduction, I'm going to hand it over to Patricia Defender, who is our planning bureau manager, and she will guide you through the presentation and take any questions.Good evening, Mayor and council members Patricia deepened over here. So this project, as Christopher noted, is a project located at 201 Pacific Coast Highway. I. The proposal is for a zone change and a zoning code amendment. This project was heard before the Planning Commission on November 5th of last year.At that time, the Planning Commission approved a site plan review for a new, new five storey buildings with 138 units, a mixed use project and a lot merger of nine lots into two separate lots. So at that time, they approved.They took those actions to approve the site plan review and the lot merger. And they also took an action to recommend that the city council approve a zone change, which I'm going to tell you more about, and also to approve zoning code amendments to expand the boundary of the Midtown specific plan.And that would be an expansion to one block west of the current boundary of Pacific Avenue. This is the site here in question at the corner of Pacific Coast Highway and Pacific. And you can see that the colored area on the map is the proposed extension zone change area and boundary extension area.This map here shows you the existing zoning. You can see from the map on the on the right that the zoning is a combination. The site currently consists of zoning. That is a combination of C, H.W. K and R2.And the first two zones are commercial zones that do not allow any residential use uses. And the second, the last of the zones that are two one is a low density residential zone. Important to note here, as Christopher mentioned, this is one of the first projects or the first project coming in using taking advantage of the newlyadopted land use element. The proposed zone change would go from. Sorry. The proposed the general plan land use element identifies this area as what's called Tod Yellow, a transit oriented district low. This place type encourages mixed use projects that mix commercial industrial uses.It encourages a development pattern that's designed to foster a pedestrian friendly and invite environment and encourage transit use. And it also encourages transition so that larger scale developments transition and step down to smaller scale developments that may be existing.The current zone being that it does not allow mixed use and each of those those zones allow only single use are inconsistent with the toddler place type. And as a result, you know, this is one of the reasons why this zone change is an appropriate zone change for this property.The general plan land use element map additionally permits seven stories at this location as you can see on the on the map shown here. The subject location is identified also in the U.S. as a major area of change and as seen on the map and as shown on the inset map on the slide, and is described asan area where transit oriented development is anticipated, given its location on a major bus corridor and its proximity to the airline station at PCH and Long Beach Boulevard. This slide here shows photos of the existing condition at the subject location.The photos are looking north at the north side of PCH and west of Pacific Avenue. The subject locations and under-used site largely vacant or occupied by surface parking. It also contains a longstanding vacant building. The site has been a nuisance attractor and contributes to blighted conditions in the area as shown particularly on the bottom photo there.The fenced off vacant lot. This slide shows the location of the proposed zone change. So the zone change would be to the Midtown specific plan, transit node low. That is the zone and it is a mixed use zone that is consistent with the Todd Low general plan place type and would be extended west to the subject site. To apply the zone. The Midtown specific plan would be extended to the subject site, as you can see here on the map. Consistent with the general plan. The table shows the consistency of the proposed specific plan, transit node, low zone with the Todd Allawi place type.So you can see the general plan identifies this area for mixed use at seven stories. The zone is a mixed use zone that allows five stories, and the project as proposed is a five story project. So this slide shows the general plan goals of the zone change helps to implement and is consistent with so it for there'sa number of different general plan goals and accommodate strategic growth and change. It encourages degraded and abandoned buildings and properties to transition to more productive uses and it diversifies and the housing opportunities and provides new opportunities for housing that is located on corridors and near transit.Likewise, the zone that is proposed better aligns the zoning of the parcels with the goals of the top low place type. It facilitates the construction of mixed use development consisting of commercial and residential uses, and it facilitates construction of new housing consistent with state laws, including Senate Bill 330, the Housing Crisis Act of 2019.And finally, it facilitates the citywide rezoning efforts to bring the zoning into alignment with the new land use element. The city is currently undertaking a systematic geographic rezoning program citywide to bring consistency between the general plan and the zoning.And this request in the meantime, is consistent with that effort to rezone in a manner that that does implement the general plan. Just a quick note on, you know, state law, this particular in particular this bill. Senate Bill 330 was passed in recognition of the current housing prices.The proposed zone change facilitates construction of new housing units consistent with this bill, which gives substantial weight to the general plan and essentially says that when the general plan, the zoning differ, the city is required to apply the objective zoning standards that are consistent with the general plan.Just very quickly, I wanted to kind of run through some of the benefits of this project and what this project does. It increases housing. It increases opportunities for access to shopping and services it will replace, as proposed the current grocery store, which is located on the site.It creates an active pedestrian environment with ground floor commercial uses and an activity to pursue. It promotes walking, biking and the use of public transit and reducing number of vehicle trips, which is something that the general plan aims to do.It replaces underutilized surface parking with new commercial opportunities. It reduces building massing adjacent to low scale residential uses by stepping down in height. And it improves safety in the area by creating eyes on the street. The this as I noted previously, the planning commission did approve site plan review for this project that's contingent on this zone changein the zoning code amendment. Just wanted to show a rendering here of the project. This is the front facade or elevation of the project that would be facing Pacific Coast Highway. This is another rendering that shows how the building steps down to a existing low scale residential use that is directly to the north of the project.So you can see that the building steps down to a height of as low as 19 feet as it approaches the single that the single storey residential uses to the north. This slide just summarizes some of the public comments.There was a significant amount of public comments at the time of the commission and some of those issues related to height and compatibility of the project to the to the neighboring development. In terms of noticing or pardon me, an addendum to the Midtown specific planning.I r was prepared for this project in accordance with sequa and it was duly noticed in accordance with the municipal code requirements and notices were mailed to owners and tenants and site was posted in publication in the newspaper as required by the code.So in closing the City Council, the recommendation is that City Council from approve an addendum to the Midtown specific plan IIR. They did approve his own change from the existing zoning to the Midtown specific plan transit node lo district and approve a zone text amendment to the Midtown specific plan to reflect the expansion of the boundary tothe subject area. With that, I'm happy to answer any questions that the Council and the Mayor might have. Thank you.Well, thank you for that. Let me first close out that part of the hearing. I don't believe there's any public comment for this hearing. Mr. Roberts. Oh, actually, I'm sorry. That's not true that you do have public comment on this hearing.So let me go ahead and have the court call the public comment and then we'll go back to Councilwoman Sorrell. So public comment, please.Mr. Mayor, this is Mike Brooks. Before we call public comment, just a reminder.We're going to need three separate votes.On this action. The first one is a resolution certifying the EIA and then a separate vote on each of the two orders and. Forward. Thank you.Well, we'll do that. Thank you. Madam Clerk, public comment.Our first speaker is John Dike's.Thank you, Mayor. City Council. I am the project manager for the project and we have been working on this for three years now and we're proud of the project presented to you. Architecturally, we think it's a significant move in that area and.We think it's going to make a big difference in helping the continued progress of that corridor, especially that Pacific PCH corridor. So those are the only comments I have. Other than we thank you for bringing this to council and we appreciate your support.Thank you.Thank you. Our next speaker is Rebecca Davis. Rebecca Davis. Our next speaker is Todd Loomis.Hi, this is Todd Lemons from Pacific six, along with John Bendis. We also are pretty excited to get this corridor up and up and optimized. You probably know our company, Pacific Six, we are we're doing the Breakers Hotel and the Ocean Center Building where we re recently negotiated to be the developer on this project.We're a Long Beach developer and we're really eager to connect with the neighbors and members of the community. And since we just recently signed on, we really haven't had a chance to do that yet, but we certainly plan to and are very excited to do that.And as with all of our projects, we are certainly committed to build a great project and and we believe that the project will be a real asset to the community. Thanks very much.Thank you. Your next speaker is Rebecca Davis. Rebecca Davis. That concludes public comment for this item.Thank you.Thank you. And with that, I'm turn it over to Montoro.Thank you, Mayor. And I want to thank all of the residents and many people who care about the current market. That's right there. It's a high personal market. And I appreciate Mr. Lim is calling in as well to introduce himself as the new property owner.I just wanted to share that, you know, the owner wanted to make a public comment but wasn't able to do so. But I just wanted to make sure that I hear that those who that he's been serving the community during this pandemic, as you know, essential business has been providing groceries as almost kind of a little bitlike a bodega in the neighborhood. Right. And so I know that he has expressed a lot of concern, as well as many who shops at his market, and that I want to make sure that he knows and many other knows that I'm committed to working with council members and danger as well, since we have, you know, residentsthat are just right neighbor that that are neighboring residents of this market and that we're committed to working together to ensure that we work with Mr. Specific six and anybody as well as residents to proceed in a way where we can continue to communicate about this development and this project as we proceed forward and just want tomake sure that, you know. That it is. We have new owners that that's how I would like to proceed and appreciate all the comments and concern people have shared and looking forward to hearing the discussion and conversation with everybody.Thank you so much. And that I motion to I don't know if we have to have a motion for a hearing, but I do want to express that. I do want to support this project and that it's bringing housing and affordable housing into our neighborhood and meanwhile, wanting to address many of the other public comments, concern thatwas provided in the slideshow. Thank you so much.Well, thank.Thank you. That's a motion for the hearing to approve. Can I get a second on the motion, please? Set in by Councilwoman Allen. Any comments? Councilwoman Allen? Councilman Allen, any comments?I do not have any comment.Customers and day has.Think, Mayor, I just want to say how grateful I am to Councilmember Sorrell for her partnership and her willingness to to involve me and my residents in this project. I am super excited about this project going up. I think it's going to going to be fantastic for District six, but not only for District six, but for Districtone as well as we are the neighboring district and we share a lot of the things across PCH. So and I also want to thank all of the residents that have gotten involved in in this project and that have been concerned.I know that it has been a great concern for us to see the displacement of a wonderful grocery store that has been providing affordable food for our our residents, both in the sixth District and in the first District.And I want to thank Mr. Kell for all that he has done. You know, up until now, providing our residents with with not only great food, but also being a staple in the community and serving our first district residents as well.I'm very excited that Pacific Six has come on. I know that they have great partnerships with the community and I know it hasn't been like that in the past couple of months and that the community has felt that they were left out from participating in this in this exciting project.So I just want to say how encouraged I am by Bay and Pacific six coming into this project. I think that they're going to be fantastic and that our community is going to absolutely benefit from having them. I think that, you know, it's it's really hard for my residents and the residents of the sixth District to seeour El Bassano market be this place. But I know that, you know, working with Councilmember Sorrell and working with Pacific Six, I'm hoping that we can provide some some good, good guidance and and maybe hopefully come up with another.I know that there's going to be an additional grocery store there. So I hope that it is tailored to our to our neighborhood. And I did have a question. When we send out notifications of projects, are those are those notifications also sent out in Spanish for the neighboring communities to understand what's going on?So Councilmember.Our.Notices typically include the bulk of a text is in English and then there is portions of the notices in other languages. And then on a case by case basis, we obviously have projects and locations where there's a lot more need for Spanish language.So when we have a meeting on those particular projects, we staff accordingly and have staff able to conduct that meeting in Spanish. When we do specialized outreach, we provide additional notification in Spanish, but the legal notice is provided in English with text at the end of the end of the notice that in Spanish and provides the optionfor the individual to request a translation. This is an area where the department, prior to COVID, was doing a lot of examination and looking to update our noticing and to to better multilingual our notices. That's a project that's on the shelf that as as COVID abates and we get back to staffing we can return to.So to answer your question, the notice is primarily done in English, but we do supplemental in situations.Where Spanish is helpful.Okay. And obviously it would, you know, in this area would be Spanish. And my so I thank you for that and for looking into that. And I thank you for for hopefully getting back to it. I think it's going to be important with other projects that may come along.And I know that there's a lot of development going on, so that's going to be very important moving forward. So I just want to say thank you to all of my residents that have been submitting comments and letting their their opinions be heard and also those that have continuously called my office and who have partnered also withwith District six. And I think this is going to be a really good project for for the city, but especially for District six and District one. And I look forward to supporting this site. And thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman. I think that concludes when we check here the council comment. We have a motion in a second. Let's do a roll call.Vote, please.District one, i. District two.I.District three. District four.I.District five i. District six. District six. I District seven. I District eight. District nine. My motion carries.Great. Thank you very much.

Her staff.We could have the questions and then Craig can answer them.Are you okay? Go ahead and start.Okay. Okay. Thank you very much, Mr. Vice Mayor. Um, so, Mr. Beck, I do have a few questions that have come up on this, and I'm hoping you could clarify them for me. Um, what's the Belarus Fund used as the primary source of repayment of the bond?Or were Mr. revenues used?Councilmember Price. We conducted a review of the Mallory's funding. It collects roughly, say, 65 to $70000, depending on where the assessment rate is set. Our debt service on our bonds is currently about $270,000, so it's really a mixture.The Melrose collected again about 65 to $70000, and then the rest of that is supplemented with parking meter revenue.Okay. So my understanding is that, um, the revenue sources for the annual payment obligations are 200,000 from parking meter revenue. And then the risk assessment. Is that right?Fairly close again. The Melrose Sets collected its first pledge to the debt service, and then the parking meter revenue makes up the difference, and that difference is roughly $200,000.Okay. Was the Belarus Fund used to pay back public works for the immediate improvement and instead of the meter revenue.Councilmember. No, that is not accurate. Again, the assessment for the Melrose is being used for debt service. We utilize parking meter revenue to do the improvements along the Second Street corridor that address the medians and the landscaping and the lights and some of the other enhancements that were made.Okay. I think that's a really important point. So it's it's a it's an unequivocal no. The reason the median repayment was budgeted as the parking meter funds budget, the Melrose Assessment was not used for the meeting. Is that correct?Yes, Councilmember, that's correct.Okay. Um. We have heard some concerns about that. There was supposed to be $700,000 in the Mallory's account. Can you shed some light on that?Councilmember I heard that, but as far as we understand, that is not correct. There was an initial bond offering of about $5.4 million when the bonds were issued in the Melrose was generated. Since then, we've been making repayments to the bond structure.And as mentioned, we're collecting roughly the 65 to $70000. What we are proposing with this action is that we would set the assessment at $0.14. This is a $0.01 decrease from the current fiscal year, which was set at $0.15.We anticipate that.Okay.So I was just going to say, we anticipate the $0.14 will generate roughly $69,000.Okay. So tonight's action would actually be decreasing it from the present 50%.That is correct. If Council approves this item, it would decrease the assessed rate from $0.15 to $0.14.Okay. What is the military spending paying for currently?Councilmember. Currently, all the funds have been expended except for roughly $70,000. It can be used for any parking improvement within the within the district. So most of the funding has already been expended. And at this point, we're just making debt service payments.Okay. And one of the requests that I had from stakeholders in my district was to continue this item to a later date. Is that possible? And if it's not, why is that?Councilmember Yes, we understand that request came forward. Unfortunately, we need to have this item addressed this evening because we have to have information to the county assessor by the end of the month to be able to put the assessment on the rolls.If we do not take action tonight, then the rate would stay at $0.15 for the next year.Okay. And then another area where we had a lot of concerns from some of the stakeholders was on the topic of notice. Can you please share to the best of your ability what the notice requirements are when there is a change in the rate?And, you know, maybe some historical perspective on when the rate has been changed and what type of outreach has been done.Well, I'll do my best. I don't have a long history with this item. I can tell you that the the assessed assessment rate was about $0.12 for a number of years. Recently, we were finding that there was a gap in the amount of money raised to be able to make the payments.So there was a recommendation to increase the $0.15. I believe city staff could have done a better job reaching out and educating the stakeholders about that increase. Unfortunately, that was not done. So you are trying to do that this year.There is not a noticing requirement, but it certainly is a best practice. That we would work with the stakeholders whenever a changes made.Yeah, I agree. And, um, this is obviously something that was initiated by staff and presented to our office as basically a. A necessity and not something that we had too much discussion or outreach on. So I think moving forward, it would be a best practice for us to engage a little bit earlier if there's going to beany rate adjustments. I'm happy to see that the rate adjustment that we're voting on tonight is actually a decrease and that it's getting us closer to the 12% rate that we had for a number of years. And in the future, should there be any sort of rate adjustment?I think it would be important for us to maybe have some discussions or or maybe even an outreach meeting in advance of it coming to council. But I know that you share that that intent with me. So moving forward will make sure that we do that.In regards to tonight's item specifically, are you able to give any sort of prediction as to whether there will be another rate change in the next year or two?Councilmember. I'm not in the prediction business, but my anticipation is that we would leave it at $0.14.Okay. So that so it would not be appropriate for me to ask you to predict what streets are going to get repaved in the next few weeks either.Maybe once you return from vacation, we can have that discussion.That sounds good. Excellent. Thank you very much. I have no additional comments or questions.Thank you, Mrs. Rice. Would you like to continue, Mr. Craig, with your report? Oh, is that it?Vice Mayor I think that we covered all the outstanding questions. I'm happy to go in more detail if the council would like, but I'm fine at this point.Thank you very much. Councilman Orson. Fine, Councilman Ewing. Okay. Do you have any public comment in this? Could you please. Come on. State your name. You have 3 minutes.Sure. Okay. Son I can feel District six. I'll be curious to hear from Mr. Beck about in regards to the roots of this area. You brought up the being decreased from $0.15 to $0.14. I just happened to find online the hundred and 12 page report done by the legal counsel that initiated the original one.I think it's Quinn Quint something Quentin related when you you know, I'm just curious about Proposition 218, which is how this even comes into effect when you change the the tax, the amount of tax for this, which is basically a parcel tax when you change the amount.Isn't there supposed to be some type of like a two thirds approval from voters? That's a question I have. And also, is this decrease within the tax? Because according to the series 29, the expectation for these bonds, it's supposed to be about 75,000 for 2019.Is there any kind of, you know, evaluation in regards to the new development on the second PCH that's coming along? Just curious about these things. Thank you.Thank you, sir. Did you want any answers to those questions or are you just. All right. Wonderful. Thank you very much. Anyone else? Fine. We can go to the vote. This is why.I did want to get some clarification.Okay. Councilman, Arson.City manager. Mr. West, can you answer the question regarding the requirement for a two thirds majority? Sure. Mr. Beck can answer.Sure. Council Member Austin Council Regarding the community's comment. This is an assessment for a specific number of parcels. This is not a citywide assessment. If you think of it, the mailroom is I like to use the term set up similar to kind of in a way where certain property owners are paying rent and those dollars are onlyused within within certain boundaries. And I think the question was put out, does does the development of the second impact have an impact to this? And as.Of now, this.Project is not within the jurisdiction of these properties.Thank you for answering that. And I was clear. I just wanted to make sure that the public was as well. Thank you.Thank you. I'm sorry I am on public comments on this item. If not, we will go to the vote just to go. District to district three.I.For.I5ii.Think District six, seven, eight, nine.

So, first of all, I want to thank Krystal de Herrera, deputy city attorney, for getting over an updated letter. It's actually a memo that was written by Mayor Hancock and addressed to the National Western Center Authority.Chairperson So this will go to the board when they are seated. But what it does is spell out the mayor's expectations of the board. And initially, when this was shared with the members of the Community Advisory Committee, it had the verbiage the authority should, and it was changed to will in several of these bullet points.And so I just wanted to thank her for this change that has been made. I'm talking about you as you walk in the door. And I think this is really important because it's it's not leaving it up to chance.It's it's pretty definitive that these things will be done. And that's an expectation from the mayor of the advisory board. The last thing I mean, advisory board, but the authority board members, I so when we had this discussion last week and we had the public hearing on this, we didn't know that the executive director of the NationalWestern Center, Kelly Lead, was going to be stepping down and moving on to other things. So I just want to reiterate my appreciation to you, Kelly, for the work you've done moving not only this project, but all the projects that you've started with the DCC.So, you know, you've got big shoes to fill. And Gretchen, you've been there every step of the way as well. So you'll be stepping into Kelly's role and the fact that you've been there means that you won't miss a beat.And so I wish you well and looking forward to the next meeting on the 28th and just appreciate all of the efforts.

That one, this isn't the end of the conversation, I think for the community piece that there's ongoing conversations.I've offered up my time as president to continue letting the mayor hear the feedback from the community. Specify criteria of the chosen selections on this board. So I still stand by that and look forward to meeting with the community on that.And thank you, Councilwoman, for for being there and walking with us through this whole issue.

Item number 41.Item 41 is a report from Public Works Recommendation to award a contract to raise Construction Inc for construction of the Colorado Lagoon Open Channel Phase two A project for total contract amount not to exceed 24 million. Amanda And will you between the public works and harbor departments and increase appropriations by 5.7 million District three.Understand this is a very big project. It's been moved by Councilmember Price before. Would you like to.I'd like to ask for a brief staff report, please.We'll have Eric Lopez, the public works director, give a brief staff overview.Thank you, Linda. Council members at the now we we are in a very exciting place. We're ready to award a construction contract for the final phase of the Colorado Lagoon Restoration Project. This is a project that's been decades in the making, and this is a project that's had countless community volunteers and residents that have both advocated andhelped with various parts of the restoration efforts. And now we're ready to kickoff the last phase, which is to reconnect the lagoon with a more natural open channel and reconnect the to alum, Marine Stadium and Alamitos Bay. This project that's possible through the creation of a mitigation bank, we were able to successfully work with the resource agenciesat the state and federal level and create a mitigation bank proposal that was approved that allows us to create credits that harbor department are our partners at the Port of Long Beach have agreed to purchase. So it's the project is funded primarily through that through the ad revenue sourced from the sale of those credits.That's why we have a memorandum of understanding and it and it allows us to move forward with what this project were. We also got a good partner with Reyes Construction and we're ready to work with them and the community on the details for construction, which we anticipate will start sometime in the fall.So we will not be impacting any summer related activities at Marina Vista Park. So with that, I'm here to answer any questions, if you have any. Thank you.So I don't have any questions because I did receive a briefing on this earlier in the week. And of course, today I just want to thank staff for their amazing work and collaboration just within the city team and also with the harbor department.I want to thank the harbor commissioners who have considered this project and been tremendous partners to the city on it, allowing us to create this first coastal mitigation bank in the state, which has been a huge opportunity for reinvestment into this environmental habitat by the Port of Long Beach.This is going to be an incredible project and it's a necessary project. A lot of people don't realize that for the long term benefits of this particular lagoon, we're going to need to have open access to the open channel so that we can have ongoing water circulation to allow for good water quality in this lagoon for forgenerations to come. And so this is a huge project. Staff has been working on it for a very long period of time. I want to thank the community who's also been involved and especially the friends of the Colorado Lagoon for being incredible partners on this project.We're getting a lot of calls from residents regarding the project and when it's going to start. I'm grateful that it's not going to start until after the summer because I know we already have a lot of programing for the youth and for the communities in the park space surrounding the lagoon and Marina Vista Park.And I look forward to the project's starting and I have committed to the residents and of course confirmed with our staff today in our Tidelands meeting that we are going to stay in consistent communication so that we can let residents know at every opportunity what is coming next in terms of the project and the construction so thateveryone can get ready for it. And this is an amazing environmental project for the city and I'm grateful for the work the staff has done. So Mr. Lopez and the entire Tidelands team, thank you for your work.Great. Thank you for those comments. Thank you for the report, Councilwoman. Your Honor.Yes, if I recall correctly, this project came before the Coastal Commission a few years ago and I was very happy to see the project going forward. I think we approved it and it's finally coming to fruition. If I remember correctly, it's it's quite a project that offers a lot of opportunity to activate a lot of the playareas and a lot of opportunities for for kids or for summer programing as well as throughout the year. So looking forward to this project being completed and to a ribbon cutting eventually some day early.I.Is in. And I'm told that this is one of a kind in terms of this is the only project that was happening in the state of California. So kudos, Councilmember Price, kudos, public works and Coastal Commission and everyone who had anything to do with this, any public comment.Dave Shukla and David.Paretsky.Wonderful piece approached the podium.Someone asked, and while they're walking up, I would be remiss to say I am the closer on this project. But Congressman Lowenthal, Gary DeLong, Frank Colonna and our mayor have had a tremendous role in this. I am just literally the closer of a project they all started, and I'm grateful to have been in that seat when theproject came forth.Dave Shukla.Quickly walk all the way back home using this very route. And it's. In the past 25 years improved, but especially in the past couple of years really improved. And this is a great project I'm fully in support of.It would be helpful if we already owned and operated all of our own utilities to be able to move projects like this one along faster. But that notwithstanding, there is a considerable amount of. Redoing of the natural landscape that was done in a very short amount of time to develop it.And this is one of the very few projects, not the only one actually in the state, just the only one that is coastal, but with a few projects in the state that's designed to actually increase and restore some of the natural capacity of from previously urbanized areas.With respect to the utility. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Good evening. Dave Peraza, board member with Friends of Colorado Lagoon. I've got so much to say that it would take 30 minutes, but I'm just going to say a couple of things. First of all, I want to thank the council and particularly Councilmember Price's leadership.It would have been easy to, at the beginning of her last term to say, you know what, we made great progress. Let's let's call it done. But she really made a priority of getting this last step done. And we are forever thankful for that work.I also really want to thank Public Works. We've been fortunate over this 20 year process to have had some incredible people to work with in public works, and we've had a lot of curves along the way. Obstacles came up in not just funding, but technical obstacles and things like that.And every single time, city staff, particularly in public works, has found a way to make this work. We've done this. Mr. LOPEZ. Correct. Can correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe we've completed every single step that was identified in our restoration feasibility study except for this open channel.And we've done so without using any general funds from the city of Long Beach. It's all been done by bringing grants into the city of Long Beach, federal, state and and even the original restoration feasibility study was paid for by a grant from the California Coastal Conservancy.So my hat's off to Mr. Lopez and his staff. Truly incredible work. And lastly, I'd like to thank the Port of Long Beach. They've been great partners throughout this process. They've saved our bacon multiple times. They have supported us financially.They have provided technical expertize, and they even bring their port volunteers down to events we have at the lagoon. They have been truly great partners. And this is one of the great things about Long Beach, if you ask me, is we've got a port, we've got great city departments, we have a wonderful city council that can seethese visions. And this is how over 25 years since we first started that we have arrived here today. So obviously I urge your consideration to approve this. We're very excited as the whole community is, to get this project going.There have been some wonderful renderings that have come out of the design documents, and when people in the community see these renderings, they get very excited. It's really going to be beautiful. Hope to see all of you down there when it's complete in what may be a year or 18 months.And again, I thank you all and please support this next.That concludes the public comment.Okay. Thank you. Is there any other comments from behind the rail with not let's vote on this momentous occasion. Members, please vote.The carry.\nReasoning:Reasoning:",

May we have the staff report?Savannah Jamison Community Planning and Development for the designation of 2 to 7 South Lincoln Street, the Glover Lynch House. The applicants are Terry and Gulliver. Gulliver and Nita Lynch, who are also the owners. This was brought forward by the owners and they diligently completed the application and did the research necessary for this designation.This may be a home that a lot of you are familiar with, as it does on the main thoroughfare to downtown Denver on South Lincoln. It is in the council district, number seven in the spear neighborhood, although it does border very closely the Baker neighborhood, as well as Walsh Park West.So it's in the little corner right there. And it is just for their property and their lot. Staff has reviewed this, as has the Landmark Preservation Commission at their public hearing and found that the application is complete and it meets criteria and two out of three categories.It is a distinctive queen and home designed by the prominent Denver architect William Leong. The home is recognizable from its prominent location on Lincoln Street and the West Washington Park neighborhood. Reconnaissance survey and history report listed the home as having architectural significance.2 to 7 South Lincoln Street meets the criteria for local designation in the following categories architecture to a embodying a distinguishing characteristic of an architectural style or type. This is almost classic textbook Queen Anne, and it's a regular form.Has the asymmetrical facade that you can see here, very distinguishing front and prominent front turret turret and a stiff steeply pitched roof also meets criteria. To be is a significant work of a recognized architect. This is the work of William Lang, it says so in the building permits, as are eight other homes along this street, which isvery rare. We have very few places where we have that many homes all together. By one architect. He was a prominent Denver architect from 1887 to 1895, and he was a partner in the firm Lang and Pew. He mostly did commercial as well as domestic and is mostly that eclectic styles.This is why it's unique that we have one where it's such a prominent just one style rather than a bunch of eclectic styles. Together by William Lang also meets Criteria three A having a prominent location or being established, familiar and orienting visual feature of the contemporary city.Many of us see it as an orienting feature. As you drive through the thoroughfare of Lincoln Street to downtown Denver, sense of public outreach went to the Landmark Preservation Commission before a public hearing, and the Landmark Preservation Commission voted unanimously to for the City Council with the recommendation of approval, also reached out to the registered neighborhood organizationswithin 200 feet and received a letter of support from the West Washington Park Neighborhood Association. Community Planning and Development and the Landmark Preservation Commission are recommending approval as application is complete and the House meets criteria for designation, meeting criteria and architecture and geography.Thank you, Ms. James. And we have three speakers signed up today and I'm say all three names and you all can come to the front pew Anita Lynch, Gertrude Grant and John Paulson. So you can make your way up to the beginning.Pew and Anita Lynch can go ahead and start whenever you are ready.Council Members My name is Anita Lynch and I own and live at 227 South Lincoln along with Terry Gulliver. And we thank you for this opportunity to submit this application and to preserve this gem of a house. It was totally refurbished about three years ago, and the integrity is there definitely on the outside and much of itis retained on the inside. And it has some interesting history. I did a lot of research on the people who lived there, and one of the families was the Nicolet family. Who? They lived there the longest. If you get a chance to ever read some of the history, it's kind of fun.And I think it's interesting as we talk about marijuana today, they were there during prohibition and we learned that they were involved in a little bit of bootlegging. So there's some real fun history from this. So we thank you and we hope you will be in support of it.Thank you, Miss Lynch. Gertrude Grant.Good evening, members of Council. My name is Gertrude Grant. I live at 224 South Lincoln, and I'm here in support of this designation. I moved into my house in 1977, and ever since then I've looked across the street at the row of Lange houses.I didn't know they were lying. I just thought they had cool little turrets and I thought it would be neat if they could be saved. But I wasn't willing to undertake it because I had undertaken a bigger house with a lot more problems than any of those houses have.But it's just really exciting. Over the 20, 30, 40 years that I've lived there, to see the houses across the street be cared for and have people who really care about preserving the historical character. And some of Denver's history.And I hope you will vote for this or this council bill.Thank you. Ms.. Grant Olsen.Thank you very much. My name is John. Also, I'm the director of preservation programs at Historic Denver. We're at 1420 Ogden Street. I'm very much in support of this designation. I first became in contact with with Nita and Terry when they were asking, along with other their neighbors about this block on 200 South Lincoln Street.They're not ready for a designation at this time. But I was very proud of Terry Anita going forward with a designation for their house, partly, of course, because it is a wonderful block. It has all of these wonderful William Lang buildings on them.Historic Denver has a great affinity for the architect, William Lang, as we are an owner of one of his more prominent and well-known one being the Molly Brown House at 1340, Pennsylvania. But as was mentioned in the staff report, this was when we were starting to do the research of this block of South Lincoln.We were very surprised ourselves to find out that there was this much concentration of William Lang buildings all together. He was very prolific architect, but he generally did buildings spaced apart all over the city and again in a very eclectic style.So this is a very rare case. We are also very proud of Anita and Terry for doing this, because designation, especially as a homeowner, is one of the most direct and long lasting things that we can do for our built environment here in Denver.And I think it really adds to the vibrancy and the richness that we have as an architectural climate here in Denver with that mixture of the old and new. So we're going to have this building for many, many years to come and hopefully they will be owners of that property for many years to come, but also forsubsequent owners of that building and that block. So we think it's a great thing for you to vote for the designation of this property and add to the richness of Denver. Thank you.Thank you, Mr. Olson. That concludes our speakers. So it's now time for questions from members of Council. Councilwoman Sheppard.Thank you, Mr. President. So I may have asked this question before. And John, I think you just alluded to this, but it would have been a nice block, too, to seek historic designation for the whole block. But why was that not there?Were there still some questions from the neighbors and homeowners about what designation means for their area? And so, you know, that's something that still has to play out. And we're still talking to the neighbors about if they want, that.They certainly are eligible for that for that block, because it is a great concentration, not only on the west side of the William Lang Properties, but also on the east side for some wonderful high end Queen Anne buildings.But it just wasn't the right time for them to go forward with a full designation. And because these these properties on this block are very significant in their own right, it was a definite option that Anita and Terry could go forward with the designation on their own.And they decided to do so not only because they wanted to save their own property, but also because they wanted to show their neighbors that, you know, it can be a wonderful thing for them.Since we have the ability to take a little bit of advantage of, you know, being on television. What might be some of the benefits to homeowners seeking a historic designation, say such in the way of tax credits or other things like that that might you know.Certainly, yeah. There's a there's a 20% tax credit for individual homeowners for any properties that are eligible or on a local or national or state register. And so the 20% tax credit is something that a lot of people actually aren't taking advantage of.But we're hopeful that more people will become aware of that the 20%. Tax credit allows for you to do investment into your properties for all kinds of different things. That's much more than just taking care of what people traditionally think of as, you know, historic elements of the property.It's also things like fax systems, plumbing, electrical things that make historic buildings livable are all eligible for tax credits. And that's a direct credit, not a deduction that you can take on your individual state taxes for that year and you can actually push it up for ten years.So whatever investment you put on your property, 20% of that comes off of your liability for your state taxes. There's also a much research that was done to show that property values actually go up at a greater rate, either from individual designations or from historic districts than do properties that are not historically designated.It's a something that allows for the stability of the real estate prices. And so historic designation has always shown to sell very, very well.And if I might ask one more clarifying question, the 20% tax credit that you referred to, is that also two contributing structures in the historic district, or does that need to be something that each individual homeowner applies for that historic designation individually?No, it's it does refer also to contributing buildings in historic districts. So if you are a contributing building in a historic district, you are eligible for that 20% tax credit. And that's something that can be handled through the Landmark Preservation Commission.And so you can put an application forward for tax credits and you can certainly talk with their staff about that as well as there's staff available at the State Historic Preservation Office, otherwise known as History Colorado, which you can find out all about what benefits the tax credits are for your property.Thank you so much. And in full disclosure, I own a property in a district, a district that is in desperate need of some help. So thank you.No problem.Thank you. Councilwoman Sheppard, any other questions from members of council? And seen nonpublic 39665 is closed time for comments from members of council. Councilman Nevett.Thank you, Mr. President. I'm happy to see this this historic designation come forward. I'm happy to see you guys stuck to your guns after the attempt at the historic district. You're doing your own house. So Team Gulliver Lynch is to be to be commended for for for bringing this forward.And it it make I bet it comes as a surprise to some people that there are these beautiful old queen ends on Lincoln. We don't think of, you know, sort of, you know, the Denver's finest buildings being right on a busy thoroughfare.And it's sort of one of the tempers of our car focus built environment that, you know, you want the the the nice houses to be away from the thoroughfare. But back in the day, they built those nice houses there because they were on the thoroughfare.They were there to be seen as people moved at a more stately pace than we do today. And so it's nice to have these buildings, which many people whiz by on their way to downtown from I 25, and now they're being called out.So thank you for.Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Sheppard.Yeah, I'd like to say a few words. So, you know, there's a tremendous amount of development happening all across this city. And there's a deep concern among many residents how we may be losing the character of our neighborhoods.And sort of the expression I hear over and over is killing the goose that laid the golden egg. And I just want to put it out there that folks it's for folks to understand that this is another tool in the toolbox for not only preservation of individual homes, but of neighborhoods.You know, if you do the proper research and have the proper input from neighbors and in the supporting evidence. And the other thing that is so interesting about that process is actually learning the history of your home and of your neighborhood.And I, I live in a small, historic district called Witter Coalfield in northwest Denver. It's three blocks by three blocks. But fortunately, my neighbors in the summertime, in the 1980s, went through the process for historic designation, and then they created a book about it that every one of us that who has a controlling structure in that districtowns. And I cannot tell you the amount of joy, you know, that we get reading through that and, you know, learning about the old, you know, interesting characters that, you know, used to listen live in our neighborhood and who, you know, who visited and what, you know, terrible loss of fortunes befell some and, you know, some ofthe rags to riches stories. And it's just fascinating. And I think it really it really adds to the quality of our life today to have this kind of understanding of, you know, where we come from. So I just want to make it clear to folks that are listening that this is another tool in the toolbox, you know, for that very important historic preservation, especially in the face of such a, you know, such a rapid pace of redevelopment in our city today. So thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman Sheppard. Councilwoman Ortega.I just want to add my thoughts as well. I want to commend folks in the neighborhood for working on this effort to sorry to hear that the actual district did not move forward. And I don't know if those efforts are still underway or not.But as we have seen development activity across the city, in my own neighborhood, the Highlands neighborhood, part of that community was created as a historic district a number of years ago under Councilman Sal Carpio. And. The development is not impacting the historic part of the neighborhood.It's impacting the area below that. So it's the lower highlands neighborhood. So it helps preserve the character of our neighborhoods because when it's all just open for, you know, the free market, if you will, you start to see drastic changes to the character of a community.And it changes the demographics, you know, the socioeconomic makeup of the community. And so by being able to create a of that kind of stability, it just, I think, preserves a lot of the quality that we have in our city of Denver.And so I just want to express my support for this application tonight moving forward. Thank you.Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega, any other comments from members of council? Scene on Madam Secretary.Raquel Nevett I. Ortega from Shepherd Susman Brooks Brown. I.

Your behavior is beyond unacceptable. Not only is the institution of policing fundamentally racist, but our BPD is a prime example. In addition, our police department honors and rewards officers involved in wrongful death and excessive force cases.Public records demonstrate that BPD showers, high pay, promotions and awards on its most violent and aggressive members. And in May, Long Beach City attorney Charles Parkin reported that the city has spent more than $31 million since 2014 to settle 61 excessive force and wrongful death claim lawsuits.Reimagining safety is about upending the imbalance of power and holding accountable those officers who act violently with impunity. This is all covered in the recent fourth article about the amount of money that is given out every year or over the past several years in these settlements.I have to ask, what do you expect to change if you're still giving this department a slush fund to cover all their murders? Why would they ever stop killing people if it's all covered and you get promoted if you kill or hurt someone?How does that disincentivize officers from reproducing this harm? Defund the police and take a bold stand against police violence, divest from BPD and invest differently in our community. Health and safety. Thank you.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nItem 15 Communication from Council Member Austin Councilmember O'Donnell. Councilmember Durango Recommendation to request city manager to include to schedule within 45 days an airport airport noise ordinance study session to educate the entire council as to the history, importance and background.Okay. Can I get a motion?So moved.Okay. There's been a there's been a motion. A second council member, I think. Austin O'Donnell.Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor. As we all know, we are pretty much at a critical juncture for the at the city right now as far as our airport is concerned. We currently don't have an airport director. And there has been rumblings in the press and throughout the community about a major customs facility potentially being developed atLong Beach Airport. This is this is a major concern to many of the residents who live in the impacted areas, particularly in and around the airport areas. And I think it merits our attention to to to to really focus on our noise ordinance and the importance of our northern ordinance, the history associated with the noise ordinance, thethe strengths of our working noise ordinance, the the opportunities and the the challenges that that may face our noise ordinance with with potential change at Long Beach Airport. You know, as I look on as you look at this this this diocese, I don't think other other than one city council member, most of us weren't here during themajor fights that crafted that noise ordinance that that actually dealt with airport the airport expansion issue. The the the the development of our new terminal and the noise ordinance is key to all of that. And so I'm asking the city manager to come back within 45 days with a study session for this council, this body.We've studied pension reform. We've studied our budget. We've done study sessions on our civic center and other issues that are very important to the city of Long Beach. And I can't think of any issue more important than our noise ordinance to the quality of life of our residents.And so I'd like to see a report back in 45 days, I mean, at least a study session within 45 days. And I ask for council support.That's been in motion in a second for the study. I know. Councilor O'Donnell.Yeah, I just want to thank Councilmember Austin for recognizing the need to protect our most vulnerable ordinance. It is sensitive. He stated pretty clearly that nobody was here when the airport wars were going on. I see retired council member Gavlak out there who was a full participant and engage with some of the folks out there in theairport wars. And you haven't seen anything until you've seen an airport war at this council because what what happened in the last round of the airport war and there has been more than one is people's homes are threatened.Individuals in this community came with came forward with a plan that was going to cost $250 million and probably invite more flights into the airport. And democracy won. In this case, the neighborhoods stood up. The council changed probably because of it or in part because of it.So don't underestimate the value of protecting this ordinance. And, you know, I urge you, don't put it in danger or you will be in danger. And what we ask is that the study session take place. I don't believe we want it in 45 days.I think we want it in mid-January. We want to get through the holidays and then bring the study session forward. So we're thinking about mid-January, January 15th ish. The city manager could could schedule this in the ask again is not just that staff give a presentation we'd like some of the community stakeholders to be able to dodo so as well. With that, I'll turn it back to you, Mr. Mayor. Is that a thank you?I just want to make sure not to veer off since I think mid-January. Okay. With you as concerned. O'Donnell stated.No, I don't want to disrupt anybody's holidays. And so I think January would be fine.I'm amenable to that. Okay.So that's that's the motion on the floor. Councilmember Ringa, any other comments from the council public comment? If you have a public comment on the item, please come forward.I got to do to make it one. Push a button.There we go.I think I can hear you. Like I say, my name is Larry Tree. I live in the flight path of the airport. So this is an important issue to me. I've lived in Long Beach since 1953, so the airport's important to me from just the citizens perspective.I'm really glad that you're having the study session. I want to thank Councilman Austin for putting it on the agenda, and I also want to thank him. Thank you, Mr. Austin, for the article and newspaper this morning to bring all of this to our attention.I think personally, I don't know what everybody else thinks by the customs facility could be really disastrous and start putting a real lot of pressure on the airport and Internet in the community. So this is a really vital interest.This, as Patrick was saying. I'm glad you're having a study session. I want to make sure that you put some thought into who's conducting this study session. You know, everybody's got a different perspective. So the person who's doing the presentation is going to have a perspective.You've got to make sure that you have everybody's perspective when you're doing your study session. You probably really ought to have members of the old wars. There was the organization called Hush. I think it was Patrick that you really ought to have somebody from Hush that that can stand there with the person, maybe from the city staffand tell you how the neighborhoods perceive this. So good luck with this. I'll be watching. And I can guarantee you all my neighbors will be watching. Thanks.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Ray Gavlak president president of hush to just calm I am they reappointed me. Okay. First of all, Al thank you so very much. And Roberto and certainly Patrick. But Patrick, I have to say to you, I'm going to miss you being here.You know, we had a great partnership and leadership to get this city to a side where we could build a terminal that serve the traveling public. And that did a fine job of it. We didn't build it too big.We could afford it. And it protected the.I believe it was modernized don't super sized.Well, that was that was on some of those. Yeah. But you know, I think it's important for the new council members really to understand that it's more than the noise ordinance. Everyone will say, but we want to support the noise ordinance.A JetBlue says we want to support the noise ordinance. It isn't about that. It's about look at the history, the litigation history and where it started. It started in 1981 when 13 airlines were suing the city of Long Beach.They wanted in here they go where it's going to be the most economically beneficial to them. And so what we have to do and what you have to do for us is to protect the communities that live underneath those flight paths.And ultimately, again, sort of like the whole the property tax revenue is the number one source to the general fund. Well, you want to keep those property values high. And if you allow a challenge to this ordinance and we lose that protection, we could be looking at really a devastating result for the city of Long Beach.So I look forward to the mid-January study session. And thank you again. And Patrick, good luck. And you might have to join me on this side when you're in town. Thanks.Thank you.Hi. My name is Jane Naito and I'm a resident in the eighth District and I was part of the war that Patrick talked about regarding the airport back a few years ago, before Patrick and Ray became council people.And I look forward to helping you guys learn about the noise ordinance and how the fight to the original hush group and their hush to helped educate the city. Because, as Councilmember Austin said, most of y'all don't know anything about how that all went down and the importance of the litigation on the noise ordinance and understanding theramifications if it gets changed. And like Ray said, JetBlue says that they want to protect the noise ordinance. And I think that's probably true because it helps them out with their mission to raise their dollars. So it's important for us to pay attention to the noise ordinance so that we can protect our properties and the well-being ofour children and grandchildren and keep the neighborhoods beautiful. So I'm glad you guys are going to do this and I look forward to working with you on it. Thanks.Thank you very much. I think that's all the public comment. I'm going to go back to Councilman Ross and then we're going to go to a vote. Got summarized a.Couple of things. I want to commend our airport staff because we have a great airport staff and they operate in the interest of this city right now. And so in no way do I want to say or anybody to imply or in for a walk away from here thinking that this council does not support its airport departmentbecause they do a great job and they are our our biggest monitors and defenders of our noise ordinance today. Secondly, I heard one of the speakers say, you know, he's concerned about who's going to be doing the noise the noise ordinance study session.Well, it will be our city manager, our city attorney, our city prosecutor. And in this language, it does say it leaves room for a lot of community input. And so I do expect to have a very robust conversation, a study session regarding our airport noise ordinance, and hopefully we can all walk away better educated and informed aboutthis very important issue. Thank you.Great. Thank you. We have a motion on the floor to have this study session. So all those in favor, please raise your hand. Motion carries unanimously. I think any of our positions are abstentions. None of it was unanimous.So obviously, moving on to the next item, which is item number 16.\nReasoning:Reasoning:",

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nCurran Gill is the executive's council liaison. I'd just like to particularly welcome, though it's unusual for me to do so. Mr. Gill to the call because he is spending part of his birthday with us. And with that, we'll move on to item seven on today's agenda.This is a proposed motion, 2021 391, which would express the Council's support for race and gender conscious affirmative action policies at the state and local level. Andrew Kim from council staff is here to provide the staff report. Mr. Kim, if you'd please, go ahead.Thank you, Mr. Chair. I hope I'm coming in. Okay. You are. Thank you, Mr. Chair. For the record and your campaign council central staff. Due to timing of this item, there is no staff report prepared. But the proposed motion language begins on page 323 of your packet.And I will actually go start with the the language starting on page 325. The proposed motion would declare that race and gender conscious affirmative action practices in the county are needed to combat discrimination that race and gender neutral measures have failed to eliminate.And in furtherance of the policy it would, the Council would urge Governor Jay Inslee to immediately sign an executive order rescinding governor's directive 98 or one. This governor's direct and then one was issued by Governor Gary Locke back in 1998 to provide directives on the implementation of 200, which was the 97 ballot measure that ended preferences basedon protected classes for public employment, public education or public contracting. The proposal proposed motion would also support, including an item in the Council's 2022 2022 legislative agenda to advocate for any legislation necessary to timely and fully implement an executive order that would rescind the Governor's Directive.94 one. The proposed motion would also support the recommendations included in the county's auditor report entitled Contracting Inequities Persisting Race Neutral Environment to Reduce Racial Disparities and Inequities in Awarding County Contracts. And as members are aware, this was presented to the Government Accountability and Oversight Committee back in in June.The proposed motion would also support county executive order entitled Pro Equity Contracting, which directs the implementation of most of the recommendations included in the County Auditor's report and as brief by some of them from some of the members at the Budget and Fiscal Management Committee yesterday.There are some budget items in the second omnibus that supports this executive order. The proposed motion would also support exploring the benefits of reestablishing a minority and women business enterprises office or program in the county to ensure consistency in contracting processes and criteria across county agencies and departments, and to also eliminate ambiguities regarding the county's commitment toeliminating racial disparities and inequities in awarding county contracts. And lastly, the proposed motion would support setting measurable countywide goals for spending with minority and women owned business enterprises to further the progress of eliminating racial disparities and inequities in awarding county contracts.Mr.. Cheryl, note that there is a title amendment for this item that was emailed to all members in the title land that would comport with the body of the motion. We also had Brooke Leary with the auditor's office and as you mentioned, Mr. Curran, deal with the Executive Office to answer any questions.And that concludes David Martin Fisher.Thank you, Mr. Kim. And I want to acknowledge and appreciate the cooperation, support and work of an executive, Constantine and his team in bringing us having the county is poised, as we are, to take this action and be as supportive a value of the partnership we have with the executive in doing this work and being where weare. Colleagues questions of Mr. Kim, Mr. Gil as Larry.Mr. Chair.Council members. Hello?Yes, thank you. I'd like to speak to this motion, please, before, Mr. Chair, I want to thank you very much for adding this incredibly important topic to your agenda. I want to thank Andrew Kim for all his excellent work, our King County Executive Branch, as well as the Washington Equity Now Alliance.For all of their advocacy we all know that I 200 and it's related executive order 9801 have had devastating impacts on women and communities of color in the two decades since they took effect. These laws have funneled billions, billions with a B of dollars out of these groups and also slashed many of their economic and educational opportunities. Some have estimated that prior to 200 state agencies and higher education institutions spent 10% of their contracting and procurement dollars with certified minority and women owned businesses. Since the passage of I 200, however, that rate has plummeted to an average of 3% from 10% to 3%.And this steep decline in economic opportunity at the state level is also felt locally. I think my colleagues remember the report that was released by our King County Auditor's office in June of this year titled Contracting Inequities Persist in Race Neutral Environment.It showed us that our own level of government has felt and dealt the painful consequences of a 290 801. So that's why this motion is before you today. It not only asks the state and our governor to rescind 9801, it also holds up a mirror to our own government and documents our own commitment to advancing contract equityat King County. So I think Andrew did a great job already of documenting what actions it requests that our King County government takes things like supporting the recommendations in the auditor's report, supporting the executive order from executive Constance, entitled Pro Equity Contracting also supports exploring and reestablishing a minority and women owned business enterprise office at King Countyand supporting and setting measurable countywide goals for spending with will be contractors. So colleagues I 200 and it's related executive order took away many of our tools for bringing about economic justice in our society. Our our region's economy has been booming in the two decades after these laws took effect.But not everyone has felt the surge in prosperity. Let's commit to our stated principles, pass this motion, and continue our work to make sure everyone in King County can thrive. Thank you, Mr. Chair.Thank you. Councilmember. Questions on the presentation. Councilmembers followed. Entertain a motion.So move, Mr. Chair.We have a motion before us to give it to pass. Recommendation to motion 2021 391. Further discussion.Mr. Chandler.Councilmember Belushi, followed by Councilmember Caldwell's.I want to also thank you for finding time on an agenda to move this forward and to have this committee discussion just as a matter of process. It's always, I think, better for us to have the opportunity to consider something and ask questions, even if we don't have all the answers right here, right now.And so I do appreciate your making time for this. The more substantively, I will repeat everything that Councilmember Zaha said, but we know at King County and in other parts of government that when we make an effort, targeted, non neutral effort to improve racial outcomes, we can move the needle.We can we can reduce disparities, we can bring up communities of color and businesses and people give them good jobs and opportunities that help to close that achievement gap that we see in every aspect of the lives in our communities.And so I think this kind of a step is really important and can make a really real world difference for people. It can help them get good jobs and economic opportunities that make our whole community better and and fairer.So I really appreciate this step. I look forward to learning more about it, quite frankly, because it's it's it's pretty it's moving pretty quickly. But I think that the sentiments stated in this motion are things that are absolutely aligned with our values and our stated goals here at King County Council.And I'm happy to be a supporter. Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember Coles.Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I first of all, I want to extend my appreciation of Councilmember San Joaquin for introducing this legislation. And I so say hello to my former colleague in the state legislature, former Representative Jesse White.And as Jesse knows, there was a lot of effort in the legislature to not have to go to the ballot. As I recall, it was an initiative to the legislature. And then when it did go to the ballot, we some of us were very active in trying to defeat it.And I bring this up because I think the history of this is important. And I ended.Up.Debating Ward Connerly, who was the proponent of Initiative 202, was the University of California regent at the time, and this is at Tulane University. There were 100 people in attendance. There were several of us on the panel. And it was one of the more noteworthy events in which I participated in my career.And frankly, I was absolutely appalled and I was very, very disturbed by the language of the ballot measure, which I thought was very deceptive and I think swayed the voters. But that's just a little bit of an aside here.And I, I had one I had been very intrigued about this legislation, and I was thinking about introducing Edmund Burke with our legal counsel, general counsel, Monique Cohen about it, because I wasn't sure whether it was something that we could really take up.And so I was very pleased when it was introduced and signed down, by the way, we worked in the legislature to try to ameliorate when we should have 200. We got some things through, but they did not make a sufficient difference.And I have long thought about, I think, the tragedy of it and should have.200.For the state and for people in it. But I am very pleased to join in, in supporting this request to the governor to rescind the Governor's directive 90 zero one. I think it can be very helpful. We are the largest county in the state and I'm.Hopeful that.Our support of this would.Be.Influential to the Governor's decision on what to do. And I also believe that with regard to what can happen at the county here, this would.Be.Very helpful. So I'm very.Pleased to support this. Thank you, Mr. Chair.Thank you, Mr. Kim. I see you turned your camera on. You did that so you can remind us that we have a panel amendment we need to adopt before we get to final passage. I'll pretend I remembered before I saw your camera.Come on and ask colleagues if there is any more speak cut remarks before we take up the title amendment. Senior nine council members are. Hello. If you would remove adoption of Title Amendment two one, which Mr. Tracy emailed to us at 804 this morning.So moved, Mr. Chair.The title Amendment two one is before a say no discussion. All those in favor of one please signify by saying i.I.Others opposed nay. The ayes have it. The title amendment is adopted. Thank you for your time. The reminder, Mr. Kemp. Further discussion. See no further discussion to close, if you wish. Council members. Hello.I urge your support.Without Madam Clerk. Would you please call the roll?Thank you, Mr. Chair. Councilmember building team. I. Councilmember Sandusky.I.Councilmember John.I.Councilmember calls Councilmember Lambert. I'm sorry. I as a member of the council.I.Councilmember one right there.

Is there interest in speaking to it or might we put it on consent?I'll put it on. I'll suggest we put it on consent and we'll always have the possibility of removing it from consent. All right. That concludes the action items in today's agenda. Before we adjourn, however, we missed a couple of votes due to technical issues.Madam Quirk, can you can we check with council members done in BAN right there for methods that are available?Absolutely. Mr. Chair. Council member. Done. I am missing a vote on 2020 10335.I think we've lost him again.And Councilmember Bond right now. I am missing votes on 2020 1033502880391.All right.

        "answer": "The meeting transcript discusses a proposed motion, 2021 391, which expresses the Council's support for race and gender conscious affirmative action policies at the state and local level. The motion aims to combat discrimination that race and gender neutral measures have failed to eliminate. The meeting also discusses the devastating impacts of I-200 and its related executive order 9801 on women and communities of color, which have funneled billions of dollars out of these groups and slashed many of their economic and educational opportunities. The proposed motion requests that the state and the governor rescind 9801 and supports exploring the benefits of reestablishing a minority and women business enterprises office or program in the county to ensure consistency in contracting processes and criteria across county agencies and departments. The meeting concludes with the council members expressing their support for the motion and adopting a title amendment.Therefore, the summary of the meeting transcripts is:\nA MOTION declaring that race- and gender-conscious affirmative action practices in the county are urgently needed to combat discrimination that race- and gender-neutral measures have failed to eliminate in King County."

We're going to go. There's been a request to go back to the hearing. To reopen the hearing. We got a motion.First, Mayor, we would need a motion to reopen. Reconsider. And a second on that. And then take a vote on the motion to reconsider. And then it would be as though we're starting the hearing again.Correct. So we're going to go ahead and do the motion to reconsider first. Can I get a motion, please?Motion to reconsider.I need to push the motion, please.I was that. But that's not the.There's a motion in a second to reconsider the hearing. Is there a public comment on the reconsideration? No.Not yet. This isn't the actual hearing yet. Just so you know.There's. Okay. So we're. We're okay. So, members, we do a roll call vote on the reconsideration.Councilwoman Gonzalez, Councilmember Pierce. Hi, Councilman Price. Councilmember Sabrina High. Councilwoman Mongo.I.Vice Mayor Andrews. Hi, Councilmember Arango. Councilman Austin. Councilmember Richardson.Hi.Okay. We're going to reconsider the motion. Councilman Pearce.Yes. First, I want to hear from the audience that's here. I don't believe that they heard the call for public comment earlier. And then I have some questions for Craig back after we hear from our constituents.Okay. Public comment, please.Hi. I'm back.I. Good evening, Mayor. Members of City Council. My name is Porter Golberg and I serve as co vice president for the fourth Street Business Improvement Association. We are incredibly thankful to Councilmember Pearce for her leadership in championing the addition of parking meters to our business corridor.We'd also like to thank the Public Works Department for their support in guiding us through this new venture for our association. Fourth Street is one of the most thriving business districts in Long Beach, and the addition of parking meters is a welcome addition to our business district, as it will increase parking availability to the many guests whopatronize our businesses, bars, restaurants and nonprofit organizations. Additionally, new parking meters will ensure our business association has a sustainable source of funding to support our efforts to continue to beautify Fourth Street, enhance public safety and increase promotion of our diverse array of businesses and nonprofit organizations in our district.On Fourth Street, we pride ourselves on our diversity and longevity as a small business and organizational hub. In an increasingly corporatized business environment, parking meters will only serve to enhance our ability to get out the message that by shopping, local patrons are not only supporting our thriving poor street community, but investing in the overall prosperity of LongBeach. Thank you again for your support. We are incredibly grateful and look forward to future partnerships with our elected leaders and with city staff. And with that said, the Board of Directors does respectfully request, based on previous conversations we've had with city staff, that the that the City Council consider amending the recommendations so that our meters areavailable for up to 3 hours for our patrons as a district that has both restaurants and the only single screen movie theater in the city of Long Beach, we want our parking meters to be available for folks to attend a dinner and a movie without having to leave halfway through the movie to refill their meter and alsoto consider implementation of parking meter fees Monday through Sunday. And in addition to just Monday through Saturday as Sunday is an incredibly vibrant shopping day for our local businesses. So thank you again for your support and we look forward to partnering with you on this new venture for Fourth Street.Thank you.Thank you very much. Any other public comment on this? Okay. I do have I do have a question and I'm obviously very supportive of the meters. But in light of that record, I just wanted to understand the three hour.Are we doing it anywhere else in the city currently? Just wanna make sure it's something that we can actually do. I'm assuming there's been some conversations already about that. Mr. Beck.Mayor, members of the council? No. Typically the parking meters are set it to our time limit. It's a challenge when we consider whether or not to meter on street parking. Certainly we do our due diligence and make sure that we're in a business corridor, that we're primarily adding metered parking for the business community.And one of the reasons that we do on street metered parking is to create turnover. So customers coming to frequent, those businesses have an opportunity to park and we don't see some of the long term parking that we are experiencing in business corridors that don't have parking meters.So all of our parking districts are currently limited to a two hour time limit. I certainly support the Fourth Street Group and all the wonderful things that they've done over there to promote business and become a thriving business corridor.But it would be somewhat of a challenge for us to extend to 3 hours. I certainly support the addition of Sun, if that's the way they want to go and we can work with them on amending the hours.So if they want to start earlier or go longer, that's certainly an option for us as well. But it would be a challenge to have one parking district that is different from our other parking districts. When you start thinking about it citywide.Okay. And I only ask a question because this is a first I've heard of the three hour chain. So I just want to make sure that I understand it because I also absolutely support the requests in front of us and the meters and everything else is because I've actually never seen a three hour common anywhere else.I just want to understand, Mr. Beck, I don't know that I've ever seen three or maybe it is common, but is there are there other beach cities or other areas that have three hour meters?I think what we've seen, Mayor, is that off street parking is usually longer, but on street parking is usually more limited. And so when I think about the fourth street corridor, I do believe we there is while it isn't as many parking spaces, there is an off street lot.Maybe that has an opportunity to extend the number of hours for the off street lot versus the on street parking.So do we know if there are other other metered parking districts anywhere that have 3 hours? I just I just.Don't know my knowledge on street.Okay. But this three hour issue was discussed prior to today.Not with myself, but possibly with my staff.Okay, Count Councilwoman Pryce.Well, I'm I'm hearing about this request right now, but I have to say, I want to hear what the rest of my colleagues have to say about this. But I think sometimes we push too hard to have consistency throughout the city.And in the process of doing that, we forget that we have different needs all throughout the city. I know, for example, in Belmont, sure, we wanted to extend our the five minute zone to a ten minute zone because it makes more sense for the types of businesses that we have on that street.And I think sometimes if there's something that's going to work better for one community versus another, we should be willing to, you know, go outside the box. These are smart meters. So unless I'm missing something, I don't know that it's going to be an additional burden on city staff to somehow and perhaps I'm missing it somehow beable to facilitate the three hour request. I think that's probably one of the advantages that was brought to our attention when we were considering smart meters is that we could have different programs in different parts of the city and tailor make them.And so I'd like us to be able to do that, if that's what the community is requesting. There is a movie theater in this stretch. There's no way a person can go in and see their movie and still be able to fall within the two hour time period.So I think allowing us to go outside of the standard parking hours makes sense in this community. And I understand there's a parking structure. I think I just heard someone say that. But I think this is something that's important to the to the businesses.And this is something they've talked about and this is something they're requesting. And we could at least try it as a pilot. And if it doesn't work out, if it becomes too burdensome for the city, then we can go to the two hour.Those are my thoughts.Thank you, Councilmember Pearce.Thank you. And thank you guys for coming and speaking on this. I do know that the 3 hours conversation has been a conversation for the last year, back and forth and. I kind of struggled with the idea of wanting consistency across the board.But I do think that this is the first time that we've had a bid this small decide to put meters there and that this is a request to make sure you can have dinner, go shopping and see a movie in 3 hours.Makes sense to me. My the things that I would like to see is that it'd be extended to 3 hours that we add Sunday. I know the time that we talked about was nine or ten. I think it's a residential area.I think it's 10:00 and is it 10:00 and in Belmont and everywhere else. So that would be I think if we went 3 hours, I would want to see us at ten instead of nine to make sure that residents can sleep in like me, who some days I don't have to go to work to 11.Those are the three changes that I would like to see. I respect staff's position on wanting it to be across the board. I think if we could reevaluate this in a year and look at how that has worked out, it would be ideal.I did have one question on the type of meters, are they going to be individual meters? Are they going to be one per ten spaces?Councilmember Pearce These will be single style meters, smart meters, similar to what we have in Belmont. Sure. So the programing aspect isn't really a challenge. I think as I mentioned, part of our review of the financial analysis and how much is this area going to generate financially to be able to pay off the capital investment took intoconsideration certain assumptions about turnover. And so certainly the three hour time limits change that turnover number. So I potentially anticipate that we may need to extend that repayment period for the capital investment, but that's something we can look at and monitor as as you suggest.Okay. Thank you very much. So those are my changes. I need to make a formal there.Can you make that in the form a motion councilmember?Yes, I would formally requested I hate doing these formal things to amend the motion to include extending it to 3 hours. Amend the motion to include Sundays for meter day. And that the start time for the program be 10 a.m..I don't know if that was in the thing or if it was nine. And thank you.10:00, right, counsel? Yeah. Okay. I think we're just that your second. Okay, great. So and again, I want to just again say I absolutely support this. I just want to understand the the three hour piece. So I appreciate the dialog, too.That was that was helpful. And Councilmember, I do think the idea of a pilot and checking how we're doing a year from now, I think is really smart. And that gives the ability of the of the association to the Business Improvement District to also evaluate.And and I want to thank you guys because not a lot of business districts voluntarily come forward and want to put in meters. And I think you guys get why it's good for the district and good for flow of traffic as well.And so thank you guys for that. There is a motion in a second to for for the motion, please, to a roll call vote.Councilwoman Gonzales, Councilmember Pierce, Councilwoman Price, Councilmember Supernanny. Hi, Councilwoman Mongo. Vice Mayor Andrews, I. Councilmember Durango. Councilman Austin. Councilmember Richardson.Cancer Council member Wangari there. I thought I heard you motion curious. Thank you very much. That is so.

Thank you, Councilmember Ortega. Your motion to adopt a move for the adoption of proclamation number 20 20041. Thank you. We've got the motion and the second to move the proclamation to be adopted this evening.Comments by members of Council. Councilmember Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. Typically we do this the week before the stock show actually launches. Somewhere in the communications we we missed that. So wanted to get that on our radar. Obviously, with COVID, you know, large crowds.The precautions have been put into place. And, you know, it was drawn to some of our attention that there was some language in part of the communication from a national western that said it would be lightly enforced. That has been taken out.It's been changed to ensure that the safety of everybody at this event is going to be taken care of. But this is, you know, National Western did not have a an event last year because of COVID. And this year, you know, because there had been more protections.Everybody we were assuming everybody is getting the vaccines so that we're we're all protecting each other. But this event really does bring the urban and the rural communities together. It's a great education opportunity, especially for our kids. I don't know if DPS is taking kids out there this year, but for for many inner city kids, they've neverseen farm animals up front where they can pet some of the small chickens and, you know, some of the the potbelly pigs and other animals that are brought to the event. This really gives our economy a shot in the arm every January when the economy seems to decline somewhat after the holidays.And so, you know, those revenues will stream in to our city coffers and help offset the costs of some of our other services that we provide back to the community. I understand Councilman Herndon will be making an announcement that I don't want to steal his thunder, but I think you'll have something fun to share with us anyway. I just would encourage all of my colleagues to support this tonight. I see Councilman Hines is wearing his cowboy hat. But you know, this this is a fun event. The precautions are being taken. If you have an opportunity to go and take your families, just make sure you mask up and, you know, wash your hands.Use the sanitary products to keep your hand sanitized and. We'll all keep each other safe. So. Just hope you all support this tonight. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Ortega. We've got Councilman Hines. You're next.Thank you, ma'am. I, I, i live. You know, as everyone knows, I live here in district ten, right in the center of the city. And before I forget, I actually got the idea of wearing the hat from Councilmember Black.She she did it first. But I actually grew up in a small town in East Texas or acts outside of a small town in East Texas. And I was kind enough to be invited to attend a national Western.Go to the National Western facility on Friday. And it reminded me a lot of where I grew up and hadn't really thought about the Expo Center and negative negativities, which had the the rodeo and the socks show for for East Texas.But it was a whole lot of fun and brought up a whole lot of memories. So I want to thank the National Center for all you do and and particularly this talk show, because it brought back memories of childhood.Good memories of childhood. So thank you so much.Wonderful. Thank you. Councilmember Hines, Councilmember Herndon.Thank you, Madam President. I want to thank Councilwoman Ortega because I thought about that last week and said, hey, we didn't do the stock show proclamation, so I'm glad that we're able to do it. Sadly, the weather and the cold temperatures didn't allow the parade to happen.But excited and moving forward and not not an announcement, but I am I'm very excited that my son C.J. will be mutton busting in this stock show season in a couple of weekends. And he is more excited than I am.We've been practicing on some pillows here in in the Herndon household. So we're excited to participate and look forward to that. And I want to wish everyone a great stock show season. Thank you, Madam President.Thank you. Councilmember Herndon I wondered what the announcement was going to be and that couldn't be any better of an announcement. What a memory for for both you and him. And so good luck to C.J. on that. I know when they used to when somebody used to win it, you might get some animal like a rabbit ora chicken or something. And I think they just give trophies. So thankfully, you're not going to go home with any additional pets. Councilman Herndon, this evening, I am more than happy to support this proclamation as well and will go ahead and follow through with the vote here.Madam Secretary, roll call, please. Ortega. I. Sandoval. I. Sawyer, I. Torres. I am black.I see tobacco.I.Clark.I.Flynn.He ha. I.Herndon.I. Can, I. Can. I.Can eat. I. Madam President, I. Madam Secretary, close the voting and announce results. 13 Eyes. 13 Eyes. Proclamation 20 2-00 for one has been adopted. We have 5 minutes for a proclamation acceptance. Councilmember Ortega, we'll go ahead and start that five minute timer.And it looks like we've got both of your speakers there. And so I'll go ahead and let you introduce them. Yeah. So I want to introduce Paul Andrews, who's the CEO of the National Western Stock Show, and then Tony Frank, who is our CSU chancellor.If you walk and if the floor is yours.Well, thank you. Members of council, can you hear us okay? We're both in my office. Okay. All right. Well, first of all, thank you. That is quite a moving proclamation. Uh, on behalf of the board of directors of the Western Stock Show Association.And I sit here next to Tony Frank, the Chancellor issue, but he's also a board member of the nation of Leicester and stock shall be wholeheartedly accept the proclamation. And thank you for your great dedication to the National Western Stock Show and your great dedication to the City of Denver in these trying times over the weekend wehad 86,000 people attend in two days for the National Western. I think most of you know that about 60% of our show is outdoors, so we feel very good about what we've done here. Working with Denver Health and the Mass of the Doors, both signage in Spanish and English.And I can tell you from personal witnessing, 99% of the people that come through those doors have a mask on that they brought from their their place. And if they forgot it, we've got one for them. So we feel good about that.And boy, we're off to a great start. Three nights of PBR bull riding start tonight and the crowds are coming in strong for that. And our rodeo series starts up again here this Thursday night, and our horse shows start up again this Thursday night after the PBR exit.So thank you again for all that you do. And let me now turn to my colleague, Tony Frank, so he can tell you all about the CSU buildings that have the grand opening as well. First of all, thanks to all of you for the proclamation.Thanks very much for your service to the city of Denver. We're proud to have to have been a longtime partner with the stock show literally since the stock show opened. As Paul continues to remind me. The president of CSU used to pay students a quarter to come to the stock show.We no longer pay students to come, but we still love the partnership. We're very proud to be partners in this project. The neighbors of Globeville, Elyria and Swansea have been very welcoming to us, helping us to get on our feet as an anchor institution, and we look forward to being partners there with them for for a very, very long time. You heard mentioned in the proclamation of the scholarship, which is something we're also very proud of and look forward to expanding. Our Vina building had its ribbon cutting on Friday, its grand opening. It's on Saturday, which is CSU day at the stock show.The Terra and hydro buildings will open later in this year. And we hope you'll all have a chance to come out and see these facilities. We think that over their lifetime, they'll make a big difference for a lot of young men and women paving a pathway to college for the next generation.Thank you so much.Thank you both. Thank you both. Thank you, Councilman Ortega, for sponsoring the proclamation. And Chancellor Frank and Mr. Andrews, we appreciate all of your work on behalf of the stock show and this important event, but then also economic driver for not only our city but the surrounding cities in Colorado and even outside our state.And so thank you very much and good luck to all of the rodeo contestants out there and especially C.J. Herndon. We'll be rooting for that little buster as he does the button bustin. All right. Very good. Thank you, Madam Secretary.\nReasoning:Reasoning:",

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nCouncil. Royal Council. Meet here. Council. Anyone else. Okay. Docket 0634 will be assigned to the Committee on City Services in Innovation Technology. Mr. Clerk, please read Docket 0635.0635.Councilor Fernandes Sanderson offer the following order for a hearing to discuss ways of creating a partnership between colleges and high schools that will create jobs and academic supports for students.Thank you. The chair recognizes Counselor Fernandez Anderson. Counsel Fernandez Anderson. You have the floor.Thank you. Earlier, I just so you know, I forgot to do my slogan when you said Councilor Fernandez Anderson aways, it means I was going to be like where the money resides, where the money resides. But then I forgot and then it's just too late.So I'll just go on to talking about this one now. So I think that, you know, the possibility of getting academic support to our high school youth via partnering between area colleges and high school is super exciting. I wonder if we can discuss at this opportunity in terms of how we can hold colleges accountable by way ofsome sort of community benefit or pilot program where they can compensate lower socioeconomic class or lower income students to tutor high school students and then create and also creating jobs to our high school or stipends as a compensation.So creating this incentive to get high schools. The two would get compensated of consequence compensated and the tutor would also be employed. And so a partnership between the city and area colleges and high schools to get academic supports to our high schools is important and vital.And I hope you guys can support this idea. Thank you. Oh, and I'd also like to add Councilor Resolution and Councilor Mickey to this order. Thank you.Hearing, hearing. No objection. Council illusion and councilman here. So, so added. Is anyone else looking to speak on this matter? The chair recognizes Constitution. Constitution. You have the floor.Thank you, President Flynn. And thank you, Councilor Fernandez, and for offering this. Many of the students in our city have no choice but to work and sometimes have to choose work over school because of family situations, especially for our black and brown students, especially for immigrant families.And so it's whether, you know, and we see this all the time, and sometimes it's just because of spending money. A lot of us here started early. I started as soon as I was able to work, I was working.That is why I think this is a really great idea, so that we can provide stipends. I'm a big fan of learning and earning give jobs to folks who are young kids, where they are able to learn and able to put some money in their pocket.That was a big benefit for me and all of my sisters who started working when we were 14. Um, so we know that a lot of our students are dropping out. They're not finishing school as the rate of at the rate of their white peers.And we know that a lot of them suffer from entrenched poverty that's rooted in cycles of structural racism. And so they can't afford to test for test. And we know that all of our wonderful and really wealthy colleges have the capacity to give back more and be better neighbors here in Boston to our students who need itthe most. A stipend for studying program, as the counselor has offered, would be a win win win for our students, for our schools and for our local colleges. And universities would pay dividends for the students who need resources to move and motivation to continue their academic pursuits and choose learning over, you know, a just a regular jobif every college students take a leadership role and to really be invested in the city of Boston. So I think this is a really great idea and I'm looking forward to partnering with Councilor Fernando Anderson on this to make sure that we are incentivizing our young kids and really doing the work of making, giving, giving them moneyso that they can so that they can learn. Thank you.Thank you. Counsel. Again, the chair recognizes councilman here. Councilman, here you have the floor.Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you to my colleague for adding me. What a beautiful surprise. So I just thank you. And I just would offer that, you know, I always talk about the fact that I had three jobs when I was in high school.So working wasn't something that I felt was a privilege. It was really more about survival. And I think the more opportunities that we can create for young people to earn while they learn and also create a pipeline of being able to give back is important.So I'm I'm happy to support this and look forward to having this involved in any of my committees, both as the Chair of Education and Workforce Development. This is a nice intersection of both. I really do appreciate your leadership and your creativity about thinking outside the box.So thank you.Thank you, councilman here. Would anyone else like to speak on this matter? What? Anyone else like to sign on to this? Please raise your hand. Mr. Kirklees. Council. Royal Council of Balk Council. Brighton Council. Councilor Fernandez Innocent Council.Florida Councilor Laura. Councilor Murphy, please add the chair.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nRecommendation to amend the contract with clean lakes to increase the contract amount by 99,000, including contingencies for vegetation management.Is just a question. So if you answer it, then I guess we can move on. These are the lagoons that back in the summer there was a lot of unpleasant aromas that came out of these lagoons and we received a lot of complaints.There were signs during the 4th of July parade and so on and so forth. So I wonder if you can just address what, if anything, we can do about that and if this contract is something that will help impact.Shore for that particular by the way, I've Liam Garland with the Public Works Department for that particular question, I'm going to turn to our odor expert, Aaron. Aaron Smith, our public works coordinator.That's not a title I've had for years. I'll take it. So the aroma that we're speaking of is in the park, Otis kind of South Shore area. A little more pronounced this year than I think in past. Couple things at the edge of Park City, at the shoreline.I think a lot of you might have noticed large excavators there. So there's a separate project that's going on that's being administered by the East Bay Regional Park District called the Groin Extension. So the groin is that cement structure that goes out into the water.It's a it's a. Crown Memorial Beach is a human made beach. And so it requires structures to keep the sand in place, so it prevents the migration of sand downward there, extending that growing project, which requires the deep digging and the exposure of decomposing matter, and that causes the aroma that kind of mucky base smell so thatthis mucky, mucky, yeah. That this year is a little bit different than in prior years. And that commenced in mid-summer in regards to lagoon three. So we have five lagoons that run from. West to East Lagoon three is the one that has the end at the Park Goodison intersection.That one in and of itself has had its own challenges and. The design of it. Each lagoon flows from one to the other and the outtake pipes for lagoon three that has a an area that we call the armpit because it's past the outtake pipes.And so the water normally would flow through and you have moving water that covers up underneath lagoons they don't smell. So there's this area that's called the armpit that the contract that you guys are speaking of has been doing additional cleaning efforts, as well as our maintenance staff to address the accumulation of the debris.Our engineers are also looking at additional dredging of that material. There was some attempt to do that in the past and the Regional Water Board had put a stop to that due to some chemicals that were found in there.But we are pushing forward on trying to re dredge that material out. Typically when the lagoons are high and the material is covered, the smell is not there. It's when the lagoons are lowered. So also adding to it, we had some atypical construction projects this summer that we needed conducive groundwater conditions, so we lowered the lagoons inthe summer again, causing the aroma that was noticed by citizens.Okay, so can we tell our constituents that next summer will be better or worse or the same?I hopefully our maintenance efforts will decrease the smell. We don't have intentions to lower the lagoons in the summertime unless some unforeseen conditions allow for it. I don't have a tentative date on the dredging. I think there always will be aroma.We live in a salt marsh bay environment. We're always going to have some level of smell, but I think we're giving it our best efforts from a maintenance perspective to reduce it.But. Thank you.QUESTION Well.Vice Mayor.If if if your intention changes with regards to lowering it next summer, will there be a process for notifying the nearby neighbors because it was a chief concern for many of the people living nearby?Yep. And we heard the citizens concerns. We actually established a website on the Public Works page just dedicated to the South Shore Lagoons, where we post any upcoming lowering dates. We also have an email distribution list that we're able to send out any notification for lowering schedules.Move upriver.A second. Did any of the council members have comments? I wanted to share that. During that time, myself and staff members met with many of the concerned citizens. We held at least one meeting and they I think you were there and we came up with an email list as well as some ideas to work with the community. So there was progress made. So I want to thank staff for participating in that. Thank you. All right. All those in favor. My motion carries unanimously. Thank you to EFF member.I pulled F and G kind of together. So it was just more of a kind of another update about the same area because that's Park and Otis. And if you could give a brief status update on where we are on the sewer replacement because during periods of heavy rain it was last week, we still see a lot\nReasoning:Reasoning:",
        "answer": "The meeting transcript discusses a recommendation to amend a contract with Clean Lakes to increase the contract amount by $99,000 for vegetation management.

You know, as the council representative on the League of California Cities, they are moving forward in Sacramento with a with the legislature and the governor to develop a funding mechanism that will help fund our streets and highways throughout the state in a significant way.This campaign to support our Fix Our Roads campaign, which has legislation attached to it. And and there is there are a number of moves being made in Sacramento to to appropriate funds and identify new funding sources for for infrastructure, which obviously is extremely important to each and every one of us as council members in our districts thathave significant needs for for road repairs throughout our communities. And so I want to thank Councilmember Roberto. You run efforts for signing on understeer. Obviously, he understands the importance of this. I would ask that the entire council support this thing and send a strong message to Sacramento that we are on board with the legislative and governor's plansto to fix our streets and roads. And I'd like to get a staff report on this from Diana Tang.Sure. Mayor and city council, as the councilman had mentioned, and the mayor was in Sacramento just yesterday actually advocating for funding for local transportation projects. This is the part of the state legislature special session. So while the special session while the normal session ends on September 11, this could or could not proceed beyond that time.I think that there's a general agreement that it will take about $6 billion for the state annually to maintain the existing streets and roads and state highways that are already in existence in California. And so the challenge now in the legislature is to find an agreement on how to raise the $6 billion a year.And in LA, which has been continually advocating for a 5050 split of those funds between the state and local governments. With that, available for questions.Councilmember Austin.Thank you, Ms.. Tang. And I also want to acknowledge Councilmember Gonzales for signing on to this a measure as well. I had the wrong one in front of me, so thank you very much as well. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Ranga.Thank you. And I, too, want to. Extend my thank you for including me in this. Love to partner with with Al. All with Cosmo Gonzales on this effort. You know one of the most. Frequent questions I always, always get is, What are you doing about my streets?And sometimes I have an answer, and most times I don't because the money is just not there. So I'm really appreciative of of this effort here that we need to get more funding into Long Beach. We need we have a lot of streets we need to fix.And I'm very happy to say no to this proposal.Councilwoman Gonzalez.Just want to thank Councilmember Austin for this. I know he's taken a lot of a a lead role in a lot of our state legislative matters. And I also want to thank Diana for her leadership in this as well.And I think we do always get that question. What are you going to do with my street? What are you going to do with my alley? What are you going to do with my anything related to infrastructure? So I think it's important that we're looking outside of the box aside from our our city general fund.Thank you.Councilor Austin.Hey, listen, I wanted to acknowledge our public works director and the great work that our public works department actually does on behalf of the residents throughout the city. We are making progress with our streets, with the limited funds that we have to work with.But I'm sure he would acknowledge if we were to get a windfall from Sacramento, it would make our situation much, much better here in the city of Long Beach. So I wanted to make sure I acknowledged the hard work of our public works department.Councilman Longo.I, too, want to echo the compliments to our public works director, and I do see this as a potential first step of outside funding. Should this get through. We would still be ten years away from where we need to be and we need to continue to look inside as well of what else we can do within thefifth District alone. We have $40 million of needed street repair, $40 million of needed street repair. And so while this could be a starting point, I think we have a lot of work to do.

As described in the staff report, staff has found that the proposed rezoning is consistent with these five strategies from campaign 2000 relating to infill development, mixed use development, providing services and neighborhoods, and being consistent with the thecharacter of existing neighborhoods of which the proposed use next to would do. The second plan is Blueprint Denver from 2000 to the concept plan used for this property is single family duplex, which calls for primarily residential but with complementary small scale commercial uses, such as those that would be allowed under the proposed U.And Next two zoning. There is also an area of stability which calls for maintaining the character of an area while accommodating some new development. As I mentioned, Baker has this pattern of small commercial buildings on corners, and this property is a nonresidential property already.So this would be maintaining the existing character of the area. Both a lot of Street and Fourth Avenue are designated locals consistent with the proposed you elected to zoning. The third plan is the Baker Neighborhood Plan from 23.In general, the Baker plan calls for providing a mixture of uses and providing services for the residents in the area. This property is in the single family and row house sub area, which calls for re-using vacant or underutilized commercial buildings which the proposed rezoning would allow and for removing non-conforming industrial uses.As I mentioned, this used to be a fortune cookie factory and industrial use. The rezoning to use mix two would remove the possibility of that going back as an industrial use and instead allow compatible commercial and residential development.So staff finds that the proposed rezoning is consistent with the adopted plans and first criterion that the second criterion is uniformity of district regulations. Staff finds that the proposed rezoning would result in the uniform application of the mixed two zone district.The third criterion is to further the public health, safety and general welfare of the city. Staff finds that the proposed rezoning would do so by implementing the city's adopted plans and facilitating the re-use of an existing building in a currently vacant parcel.The fourth criterion is justifying circumstances. Staff finds that the proposed rezoning is justified by the changed conditions, and there's been additional development and redevelopment in the Becker neighborhood. The population has increased. The demand for these kind of neighborhood services has increased.And so it's appropriate to rezone to allow for neighborhood serving commercial uses and residential on the property. And the fifth criterion is consistency with neighborhood context, zoned district purpose and intent. As mentioned, the existing context is urban neighborhood.The proposed context is also urban neighborhood. This is a good example of an urban neighborhood context in daycare. So it's consistent with that. And the Annex two would allow development consistent with the purpose of the intent of that zone district so that staff finds all five criteria and recommends approval.I'll be happy to answer any questions.All right. Thank you, Mr. Robinson. We have two speakers this evening. Bruce O'Donnell, you have 3 minutes. And Chairman Sekou, you have six.Thank you. Mr. President, members of council, I am Bruce O'Donnell, 386 Emmerson Street, Denver.

Want to say. We appreciate the work that. City planning and. Folks do as they go about putting this kind of stuff together. Because you go to certain rules, regulations to do this.And this clearly comes in line with all that. Like all the others before us. And the truth is at this point as we speak. From the public's point of view. It becomes one of those. What I was going.Because you're ain't going to. Nothing. And we ain't gonna get nothing out of this. Nothing. We're not going to get the housing needs that we need, that we can afford, that you consider affordable. Thanks. I have. It's going to be passed on and looked over.And we have other conversations and you know, y'all gonna put stuff in the board and you're gonna give them stuff to work with and then, hey. Nothing's going to happen. So if I can just stop posturing. We can start coming up with hope plans.And then we can start voting for things that you morally don't agree with. Just let it roll through. Just let it roll. Because when it's all said and done at the end of the day. Very few really. One solution for all this for you.And that's revolution. That's it. And it just came down to that because we run into a wall and we keep getting different variations of themes in this saying stuff. But when it comes to actually having the people that are committed to make it happen and give up the vote and take a risk to where they're going tobe reelected, did not and somebody is going to like them were not intended to do. And the mayor and the king look. How much longer do you think we going to put up with this? And why should we even put up with it?Chairman Sekou for 22.So you know what? Just so you can go home and rest, so you can silence the voice of the public. We're going to say, hey, we're going to go along with this. We're not going to postpone. I mean, everybody can go home quicker.And good luck, whatever you do, because we're going to do what we're going to do. That's it.All right. Thank you. Questions by members of council. Scott, let me ask you a quick question. This looks like a downed Sony.In terms of height. Yes, it goes from two and a half storeys to two. In terms of allowed uses, it increases the allowed use as the you are h 2.5 is strictly residential. This allows both residential and commercial.Yeah. Is this is this supported by other neighborhood groups?Yes. There's a lot of support from the big historic neighborhood association. There are only two are nos in the area of Baker. And I can.See this and I didn't hear you on the planning board.A passive unanimous support from. Correct?All right. All right. Any other questions by members of council? All right. This concludes Constable for 22 comments by members of Council.Jasmine Clarke Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you to Scott and staff for putting together that report. I think it's been clearly demonstrated that this meets the five legal criteria for rezoning and I will be supporting it. I also just wanted to give a shout out to Bruce and the team for working so closely with this.Within the the baker has talked neighborhood association are no boundaries and that's always sensitive is one of Denver's biggest historic neighborhoods and I appreciate all the time and effort working with their zoning committee, working with their board to make sure that this was also a good fit for the neighborhood.And so I want to say thank you for that. And I will be supporting tonight. Thanks.All right. Thank you, Councilman Clark. Seeing all the comments. I'm Secretary Raquel.Clark. All right, Espinosa. Hi, Flynn. Hi, Gilmore. I Herndon.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThank you. So that concludes public comment. So we're going to go a little out of order. We have a I know there's a lot of people waiting here, but we have one more brief item to get to before that item.So we'll take item number 11, please.Communication from Councilman Austin, Councilwoman Gonzalez, Councilman Andrews and Council member would UNGA recommendation to refer to the Parks and Recreation Commission and the Housing and Neighborhoods Committee. The request to consider naming the park at Del Amo Boulevard and Oregon Avenue after C David Molina.Thank you, Councilman Austin.Thank you. And I want to thank council members Gonzalez Andrews in Urunga for signing on in support of this item. As many of you may know, we will start very soon work on a new 3.3 acre park at the southwest corner of Delano and Oregon Avenue in a district.The neighborhood has been anxiously awaiting this park ever since it was originally acquired by the redevelopment agency almost a decade ago. Now, thanks to the actions of this City Council last year in the partnership with Integral Communities, this park is about to be built.This park will provide athletic fields a lot and a playground walking paths and access to the Dominguez Gap wetlands to an underserved community. After discussing this issue with many people, I would like to recommend for consideration that we named this park after someone who was a pioneer in the health care field and left a lasting legacy notonly for Long Beach but throughout the nation. Dr. C David Molina was born in Yuma, Arizona in 1926, and he studied education at San Diego State University. He began his career as an elementary school teacher at Yuma Indian School and later taught in Long Beach.After earning his medical degree, he set up a private practice in Long Beach in 1962. He started Long Beach's first intensive care unit at Pacific Hospital, where he also served as the director of emergency department of the emergency department for 21 years.He earned a grant to develop a paramedic system for the Long Beach and trained the city's first firefighters to become paramedics. Dr. Molina noticed that low income, uninsured and non-English speaking patients were coming to the emergency room in need of general health care services.So in 1980, David Molina opened the clinic to Long Beach to provide low income families with a place to get personalized health care. He soon found it Molina Medical Center's and served as its president and chief executive officer.By 1994, Molina Health Care was a licensed health care plan in California. Dr. Molina, unfortunately, passed away in 1996, but his legacy continues. His children Mario, John, Martha, Josephine and Janet and the extended Molina family continue to serve this city in a number of fields and endeavors.Two of them are joining us today. John and Janet, thank you. Today. MOLINA Health care's a Fortune 500 multi-state health care organization. It serves more than 5 million individuals and families. Melina Health care is still headquartered in Long Beach.And David Melina's grandchildren I'm sorry, his children now run the company. His grandchildren are still involved in the city as well. Given the lasting contributions of Dr. David Melina to the city of Long Beach and his legacy of providing critical medical services to underserved communities throughout the nation, it is fitting to consider the new park at theAlamo, an organ in his honor. I move to refer this recommendation to the Parks Recreation Commission and Housing and Neighborhoods Committee for consideration and recommendation back to the City Council. And I would ask for my council colleagues for support in this endeavor.Thank you.Thank you. Council member. Would you like to make the motion this item? Is there a second? Great. Next up, Councilmember Ringa.Without question, the Molino family has been a staple and a steady source of hope here in the city of Long Beach. Their philanthropic endeavors in Long Beach and elsewhere is unquestioned and welcomed. And I see no cause to name this part anything other than the Sea Molina Park.Thank you, supporter.Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.I too am very supportive of this. I think that they are a staple of our community.And when you go to anywhere.Else, Washington, D.C. or otherwise, and people.Say, wow, Long Beach is not only.Diverse, but one of the largest Hispanic owned businesses in the country is right here in Long Beach. And it's not just about being the biggest for them. It's also about providing quality. And I think that they provide not only quality to their customers.But knowing people that work there. They really provide a quality work environment and a lot of jobs to our neighbors. So we appreciate.All of that. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Andrews.Thank you, Vice Mayor. You know, I want to thank Councilman Osman bringing this item forward. You know, I have a lot of respect for the Parks and Recreation Commission. I hope they take into consideration this suggestion. John Molina was a wonderful person who looked out for the underserved.His legacy carries on, but we should honor him in a special way. And this park will be it. And I want to thank you guys again and thank you again.The stars of the great news for.Thank you, Councilmember Pearce.I also wanted to say this is a great item. I think honoring people that have done great work in Long Beach is always a great opportunity. A park where we talk about health as as we try to engage our youth to be active is also really important.And I also want to thank the Molina Foundation for their support of things like the aquarium, places of education. I think that you guys are doing a great job and we're really lucky to have you in Long Beach.So thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman Price.I want to echo everything that my colleagues have said, and I want to thank Councilman Austin for bringing this item forward. It's fitting and appropriate. And this is exactly the type of situation that we should keep in mind when we're talking about naming our public spaces.So thank you very much. And thank you to the Molina family for all they've done and all that you continue to do for our community. It's very much appreciated.Thank you, Councilman Andrea.So I mentioned John, but I know it's David was just trying to name a park after you already, so just stick around, buddy.Thank you. And I'll just add congratulations and thank you to Councilman Austin, everyone who signed on this, I think. MOLINA It's no secret these folks are very present in the community and this just sort of reaffirms that commitment.So you'll have my my clear support on this. So is there any public comment on this item?Hi. I'm Janet Molina. What? I just wanted to say thank you for considering.Honoring this our father by considering naming this park after him as one of five children. Parks are very important. Growing up, we were at Eldorado.Whaley taking different parks and.Rec classes from when we were growing up and then to our families. Now we still use the parks our kids ride, their bikes, their walk, their Greenspaces are so important.To the livelihood of communities and the health and well-being of.Everybody. So we really consider this an honor. Thank you.Thank you. Any further public comment? Is this the last public comment? If so, we'll close it after this.Good thinking, honorable mayor and members of the city council. My name is Rita Cox and I live in the eighth District and in Long Beach all my life. I love Long Beach and everything that it has to offer.I treasure the city's past, and I'm confident the future holds many positive changes. One of the positive changes that I'm happy to speak to you about tonight is the importance of the new 3.3 acre park at Alamo Boulevard and Oregon Avenue and the naming it in honor of Dr. Molina.This is an exceptional, wonderful opportunity for the community of the eighth District. There is more to a livable community than the development of property for residential and commercial uses. There is a need for parks, libraries and open space.Parks and open spaces are necessary components of a healthy, well-balanced community in the eighth District. There is just this need. As you're probably aware, the district is a high density residential community with mixed commercial uses. This new 3.3 acre park will improve and add to the quality of life for many.A place where people can go and get away from the everyday hustle and bustle. The location is ideal next to the Los Angeles River, with its additional benefits of walking, hiking trails, horses, ducks, a bike path to the beach.Just as importantly, I sincerely hope the park will remain open space now and in the future for the people. We need to protect our parks and open spaces for the precious resources they are. This is truly a win win situation.More open space for the community and also importantly, no fiscal impact for the city. I hope input from the surrounding community will serve to be a valuable part of the planning process and I hope plans will be available online along with the new library and the improvements of the first wetlands.This new park is a much needed and welcome addition to the district. Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.CARROLL Sean and I live two.Blocks down the street from this park. And what better.Way to remember somebody.Continually by naming a park after them, especially since they've done so much for this city. Thank you.Thank you. And we have someone queued up up top to speak next. Wave your hand if you queued up to speak of top. Okay. Seeing none will move forward. The next speaker here.And Control. And no, I don't live in this district, but I am very happy to see that there is going to be another park in Long Beach. When this was being proposed. The developer who is providing the money for the park said that.The city wanted to put in artificial turf for the sports complex or the soccer field there. And he. Would be willing to put in natural grass with all of these people talking about open space. I hope you will consider putting in natural grass instead of artificial turf.As you are aware, artificial turf has to be fenced so that there is no damage to the field with food, with chewing gum, with bicycles, all the things that can tear up artificial turf. And so the general public is not going to have access to this section of the park that is going to be a soccer field. That's I'm glad that you are naming it after Dr. Molino, but I think you should also be considering having open space for the whole public. And this would be accessible to everyone, not just soccer. Thank you.Thank you. I don't see any other public comment. I'm going to turn this back over to council member Austin.Thank you. And I want to thank my and my colleagues for all of the supportive comments. I've heard a lot of supportive comments from the public as well. I want to make just a couple of points on this.This park has been been the long awaited resource for for the city. Again, it's been almost ten years getting to this point. And we have a lot of great assets that are connected to this park, including the DeForest Wetlands area, which is beautiful, natural open space just across the Alamo.We are developing the the Forest Wetlands Restoration Project, which is going to be beautiful, natural open space. It's right along the L.A. River, where people have the access to ride their bikes through recreation. And in the future, we hope to have uses of the L.A. River as recreational opportunities for for the public.And so when we talk about creating open space, that's exactly what we're doing in the eighth District in North Long Beach. There's going to be acres and acres of open space created. This is going to be an active, mostly active recreational space, which I think is going to be a tremendous addition to this community.And so, again, members, I would ask for your support.Thank you and great recommendation here. So we're very happy about this. Please go ahead. Cast your votes.Motion carries.Great. Thank you. And that moves on to the Parks and Recreation Commission. And now we're moving back over to item number ten.\nReasoning:Reasoning:",

This ordinance would also require regular updates on progress made regarding diverse hiring and promotions and require that the Chief Diversity Officer work with officers to make surethat there are fair hiring practices in place for family members of current employees. During the working session, the committee heard language suggestions on and speaking to collective bargaining agreements, which would not be subject to this ordinance at all.All collective bargaining agreements supersede this. There was further discussion regarding the duties of the Chief Diversity Officer and the language suggestions on how covered employees would receive a promotion, upgrade or reclassification.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nOkay. Moving on to consent, calendar item number five, Councilwoman Price.Thank you. I wanted to pull this item. We received a number of emails today from residents in the third district who were concerned about this particular item, specifically the planning of the demolition, the truck routes, the traffic related concerns that would arise as a result of the demolition.And I'd like to ask staff to address some of those concerns. I have forwarded several of the emails that I received today to members of our staff, and I'm hopeful that they can help address some of the concerns raised.Mr. WEST Mayor, council members, I'm going to turn this over to our development services director, Amy Bolduc, to respond to those issues.Mr. Mayor, members of the City Council and Mr. Mays. Hello.Sorry for that. We. A couple of the issues that were we've addressed.Related to the truck routes. That is something that we are working on with our Department of Public Works Traffic Engineer. That truck route will be something that is.Responded to and dealt with through our traditional process. In general, when we deal with demolition of buildings, there are a number of protections.That are required of any demolition site or any construction.Site, and that does include things like haul routes, how.How the construction activity is staged.How the area is fenced off and protected.So that.Members of the public that do not access the construction area and how we protect the surrounding environment. We have a number of municipal code regulations that also dictate how those demolition.Activities also occur. Back in April, to a point that was raised in one of the emails that Ms.. Price is referring to, back in April, the City Council executed an adopted a statutory exemption under the California Environmental Quality Act.So for all intents and purposes, CEQA has been done and and the.Project has complied with Sequoia.In order for us to proceed with the demolition phase only. I want to make it clear that we are only talking about the demolition of the existing pool. We are not discussing the new construction of the new pool because we don't yet have a program that has been approved by the City Council for us to move forward. Any discussion about the.Long term location.Or quantity or quality of vegetation, landscaping and the eventual construction of the pool, all of those issues get vetted through a separate, secure process for the new construction of the new pool. So related to the demolition, we have cleared the demolition project under Sequoia.And the item before you tonight is allowing us to issue a coastal development permit because this project is in the coastal zone and because it is in dual jurisdictions of both the city and the California Coastal Commission, there is a process that allows us to request that only one coastal development permit be issued, and we give ourauthority to the Coastal Commission that does streamline the process and it does make sure that the conditions of approval that are placed on a project are consistent. If we were to do this separately, we might put on one condition of approval and the Coastal Commission may have the ability to put on a separate, conflicting condition of approval. So by doing.A.Consolidated coastal development permit process, it does streamline that process and allows us to act as one agency. If you proceed with the adoption of the resolution tonight, we are hoping that we would go to the California Coastal Commission in October, and if they approve the coastal development permit, then we would initiate demolition activities by mid to lateOctober. We have committed to the Coastal Commission that we would maintain protections above and beyond those required at this time for the vegetation surrounding the area, particularly related to trees and bird species. And we have done surveys on what birds are out there, whether they are nesting or roosting.And we have also had a certified biologist go out to the site as well. All of those issues have been cleared. We've shared all that information with the Coastal Commission in anticipation of of their reviewing this item in October.Hopefully that addressed the issues that were raised. And I'm here to answer any.Questions you may have, Councilwoman.In terms of the truck routes necessary for the demolition process, will there be obviously we want to make sure that we pick. Roots and a path that's least invasive to the residents there. So what kind of meetings or discussions are we going to have to make sure that we pick the route that's least invasive?So typically the traffic engineer looks at the existing truck routes within the city and we try to keep the all the trucks on those mapped existing truck routes. Clearly, there is not a direct truck route that goes to this facility.So the.Traffic engineer.Is tasked with coming up with options to get the trucks to the closest truck route possible. It will go through a couple of local streets, but that is the discretion of the traffic engineer to look at the various options and pick the route that is least invasive to the residential neighborhood.Thank you. I have nothing further.Thank you. Katherine Mongeau.I just wanted to comment on the path that's used in my district for another project that the city traffic engineer has been instrumental on, and that the residents have been very appreciative of the responsiveness and the penalties to contractors that do not abide by the guidelines and rules.I think the city has been very proactive to make sure that the neighbors are kept apprized of the situation and it seems like we've come to a great resolution. So when our area was destroyed, we're actually under construction now.Everything went very well and everyone was very responsive. So I look forward to that same thing with the blah blah.Thank you. Can we get a motion to approve some? There's been a motion and a second. Any public comment on the item? Very good. Clark has the address. So if I understand this correctly, what we're but what we're dealing with here is only only only that which is related to taking down the building and working out thetraffic patterns. Is that correct? Of how the what is removed goes, which is which is central? We've been through that with the Terminal Avenue Storm Drain Project. And just in case I'm not here, when other items come up, the import of this is obviously it's going to take more than a fortnight to get this done.And history demonstrates, quite frankly. And some people may take it personally. Sometimes the staff can't be trusted. The majority of them can. So what we will end up with, what I want to try to avoid is a year from now, two years from now and down the pike, they have a permit for X, Y and for one, two, three, four components and then slip in six or seven. That might be contentious and people may try to slip that in underneath the radar. And that has happened. And we don't have to go too far back in history to see that.So as long as we're confident, as long as there's an understanding now that this just has to do with the removal. That's fine. The only other comment I would have made, I would hopefully deal with that. We take a look at maybe just putting that stuff on a barge and taking it whatever it is, and remove itfrom our area that way and obviously not dumping it in the water, but maybe instead of a truck, we use a barge. We've got a pier there. Run the truck out there. Thank you. And they won't have any traffic lights.Thank you. No other public comment on the item.

Staff members address these concerns and explain the process for obtaining a coastal development permit. The traffic engineer is tasked with finding the least invasive truck route possible, and the city has committed to maintaining protections for the surrounding vegetation and bird species. The council approves the resolution, and the item is set to go before the California Coastal Commission in October.Therefore, the summary of the meeting transcripts is:\nRecommendation to adopt resolution allowing for the initiation of a Consolidated Coastal Development Permit process pursuant to Section 30601.3 of the Public Resources Code (Coastal Act) in connection with the demolition of the Belmont Plaza Pool facility at 4000 East Olympic Plaza.

Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThe report The Housing, Health, Energy and Workers Rights Committee Agenda Item seven Council Bill 119 319 related to the City Department's Advanced Metering Infrastructure Program, adding a new section 21.40.9.0 95 to the ceremony. Speaker Committee recommends the bill pass.Casper. Mesquita.Thank you, Mr. Chair. First, I want to say thank you to our friends at the ACLU. The folks at ACLU, specifically Shanker and Orion, has been working to make sure that we put into place advanced meter infrastructure technology that protects the data of all consumers.Councilmember O'Brien has been working on this for a while, and I want to thank the folks at Seattle City Light and the Office of the Attorneys, the city attorneys as well. We have been able to craft legislation that I think accomplishes the following.We want to make sure that an AI led technology is implemented in a way to make sure that we can monitor energy efficiency and improve the collection of actual data so that our bills reflect the actual usage and that we can identify ways to improve energy efficiency over the long haul.What we know is that because of Councilmember Brian and the previous council here, there has been policies put into place in rules that do protect consumer data. What this legislation does is it codifies our commitment to making sure that all data is truly protected, that we as a city and our subcontractors don't share, disclose or make availableconsumer data in a way that would be inappropriate. We want to make sure that every customer, every resident in Seattle feels comfortable using the AMI technology and for those who don't. This legislation also sets limits on the fees associated with opting out, making it clear that they can be no more than the cost of actually reading thealternative meter. So that I think that we create a little bit more parity here. Again, I think that this is important for us as we get into new areas where we're using technology in different ways, where we're collecting data that we haven't collected in the past.We need to step up and make sure that our contracts and our commitment to protect data reflect each other. So I'm really excited about the type of commitments this will put in place for contracts in the future. We also want to make sure that the customers feel that we have responded to their concerns with urgency, and Ithink that this legislation does that. So I appreciate the past steps that Seattle City has made, and I really hope that the Council will adopt this resolution or sorry, adopt this ordinance today to codify these rules into statute.Again, I want to thank Councilmember O'Brien. Thank you to your staff, especially Lakeisha Farmer, who's been working with us on this. And I look forward to working with you all to make sure that we implement these councilmember action.Councilmembers have been very helpful as well in our committee as we talked about this issue multiple times over the last few months. So thank you to all of you for your collaboration and for helping us to find the right path forward on AMI protections.Thank you. Customers get any comments?Councilmember Yeah. Thank you. I want to go right back at Councilmember Mosquito. I really appreciated the time you've spent on this and bringing Seattle City Light to the table. But also, I think importantly, a number of our I would consider them to be some of the loyal opposition around privacy that they wanted to make sure that wewere not going in and getting data from people's homes and businesses that they felt was personal. And the fact that we had ACLU involved in the conversations and that at our last meeting, I asked one of the speakers directly.Are you supporting this legislation as is? And the answer was yes. So thank you so much for the work that you've done in pulling this together. Thank you.Q Councilmember O'Brien.Thank you for your comments, Councilman Muscat. I appreciate the recognition, but I want to say that to get it to this point required a lot of work, and it was just a lot of back and forth on nuances of working with attorneys in the department.And I want to give credit to the city attorney's office and Seattle, see the light for them showing up for those conversations. But I know you and your team put a lot of time into getting it here, and I'm grateful to get the chance to work with you on this.I'm really proud of this legislation and thank you for doing that.Very good. Just like we got a couple of votes and the other was okay, please call the roll on the passage of the bill.JOHNSON Macheda I. O'BRIEN Hi, Sergeant Bakeshop. Gonzales Hi, Herbold. President Harrell.

Committee on Civil Rights, Immigration and Immigration Advancement. Docket 0324. Mr. Clarke, please read 03240324.Council Illusion offered the following order for a hearing on the civil rights and liberties of returning citizens and reentry into their Boston communities.They did she recognizes counsel counsel Luann and and on docket 0324.Thank you very much, Mr. President. I offer this order, hearing orders that we can really evaluate and see what we can do more to support our returning citizens. Many of us participated in various forms of the budget listening tour that the mayor held, and we heard again and again the ones that I attended from returning citizens themselvesabout the lack of resources and lack of. And what we have we now have an office of returning citizens. What we can do to further buttress that office, to support the more than 3000 people a year returning to the city of Boston from prisons and jails who are in need of permanent housing or in need of employmentor in need of driver's licenses. The very basics. And sometimes we need more than just referrals. We need people who are actually able to do case management and, you know, help people interact with them through the process. And we know that this is an issue that disproportionately affects our black and Latinx residents who are overrepresented and disproportionatelyrepresented in our criminal legal system. And we know that there are particular burdens, burdens that are that returning citizens face when it comes to placement in public housing because of because the very stringent rules around who can reside in public housing.And we also know that the prison system has long housed and held a significant portion of folks out front for mental health issues. So this is really when we're talking about folks returning our returning citizens, we're talking about connecting them to the mental health resources that they should have gotten in the first place.I had clients as a housing attorney who were I had to go visit in jail when they really should have been receiving services from a psychiatrist and got caught up in a very, very punitive system. So this is a hearing order to bring together voices in this space, a lot of them being led by returning citizens toreally put our money and focus on really helping people to become whole. We too often are focused on individual decision making by a by an individual and not systemic problems and not bad policies that lead to people making sometimes decisions that are that lead them to this to places of incarceration.So this hearing order, I hope to discuss these issues and bring our office of returning citizens together with a lot of folks just for housing has been very active in this space and a number of returning citizens are hoping that we can get this out as part of the discussion to also talk about it as part ofthe budget. Thank you.Thank you. Counsel. Which and would anyone else start? Sorry. I'd also.Like to add Councilor Ryan.We're out to this to this here in order.Thank you. Sorry.Council of Wirral has added Council. Where would you like to speak on this matter? The Chair recognizes counsel role. Thank you.Chair, and thank you, counsel Louis.Jahn for bringing this quorum.Issue to the floor. And with the shadows, mass incarceration.Has cast upon too many of our communities.Especially.Black and brown neighborhoods.In our city. We need to ensure that those who have served their time.Can return to their communities with the opportunities, services and support they need to reintegrate successfully. Too often, residents end up in our correctional facilities because our city has failed to deliver them. The Education Economic Opportunity. As Counsel Louise Diane said also said mental health.Services and stable housing.They need it and to which they are entitled to. These systemic failures are exactly why we need to assess.How we can ensure every returning citizen has a.Civil rights restored and that our reentry efforts adequately address the root causes of criminal criminalization incarceration. I'm proud to support this here in order to better support our return to citizens and in assess how we interrupt these cycles.Thank you. Thank you, Counsel. Earl. But anyone else like to speak on this matter? The Chair recognizes counsel of our counsel. Why? You of the fourth.Thank you, President Flynn. Well, that feels nice. Thank you, Counselor Eugene and Counselor Morel for bringing this hearing order onto the floor. In a previous life, I served as a street worker and a direct violence intervention worker here in the city of Boston, first in Mattapan and then in lower Roxbury and in the South End.A large part of the work that I did was to support young people and young men and women who are not only systems involved, but who are currently and previously incarcerated. And so this is an issue that's very near and dear to my heart.I think when we're having conversations, particularly around the civil liberties of people who are currently or formerly incarcerated, we need to expand what civil liberties are afforded to them before they become systems involved and also after they come home and want to expand the way that we think about reentry, not only with a problem, with a problemfree solution frame, which calls on whether they have education, have a house and so on and so forth. But to think about the emotional well-being and how they are reintegrated into their community and into the civil process, whether it be through community organizing, voting and so on and so forth.So I'm really looking forward to this hearing. I'm looking forward to hearing from folks who are currently or previously incarcerated on what the levels of support they need from the city of Boston. And I would also urge us to look beyond the supports that come from city government and look directly to communities to offer the support tothese folks. So thank you.Thank you. Thank you. Counsel. Laura. The chair recognizes Counselor Arroyo. Counsel Royall, you have the floor.Thank you. President Flynn. And thank you, Counselor Louis Gen and Counsel Ralph for offering this. Over 90% of our incarcerated population returns back to our communities. That's that's the number. And so often what they need and what led them into the to be system involved in the first place is stabilization and resources.And often when they are entering or exiting, they are not receiving those resources. And that's actually a detriment to our public safety, a detriment to them, a detriment to their families. And if we are serious about ending cycles of trauma, ending cycles of of harm, we're going to have to be serious about providing resources and dedicating resourcesto folks. I know this deals specifically as well with some of their civil liberties in the actions we take there. But I also know that it has to deal with and does mention the things that we have to do to make sure that we take care of them from a resource standpoint.And so this is incredibly important work. This has a direct impact on so many people's lives and family's lives and a direct impact on ending cycles of harm and trauma. And so please add my name. Thank you for your leadership on on presenting this.And I look forward to hearing not just what comes out of this hearing, but what we do from the from that hearing on. So thank you all.The the chair recognizes the council region. Okay. Anyone else like to speak on this matter? The chair recognizes Councilor Baker. I just want to say. Okay, please. That council. Baker's name, please. That council box name. Buxton, Councilor Brading Council.Royal Council. Edwards. Councilor Fernandez Anderson. Councilor Clarity. Councilor Laura murphy. And please add the chair. I also wanted to highlight that myself and Council have already had several hearings in the past on quarry reform, which is also a critical part of this as well.Governor Patrick did an outstanding job working with the legislature in making reforms to quarry, but we need to go even further than that. As a as a former probation officer, there's nothing more frustrating for someone coming out of jail or coming out of prison to have that quarry hang over their head for their entire life, not beingable to get a job or get into housing. But just want to say thank you to my councilors, fellow colleagues, for the incredible work that they've done on this work, on this issue. Docket 0293.

My name is Libby Adams of Community Planning and Development, and I'll be presenting the MAP Amendment for 1880 South Monroe Street. This application is located in Council District six in the University Park neighborhood. The property is located between Bucktown Boulevard and I 25.The applicant is requesting to reason from urban edge single unit D two Urban Edge single unit RD one to allow for an accessory dwelling unit. The property was red zone from ESU D X to ESU D in 2019 as part of a legislative rezoning in University Park to eliminate the suburban house building form within the neighborhood.The site is currently occupied by a single unit home. You can see its mostly single unit in this area, but then multi-unit directly east and south of the site. This slide shows the residential nature of the area with the subject property on the upper right hand side and then some of the single unit residences and then multi-unitresidence just to the south. A postcard notifying neighboring property.Owners was sent out.Within 200 feet of the site on February 25th. To date, staff has received a statement from the registered neighborhood organization and three comments from neighboring residents, all in support of the proposed rezoning. Although one comment did note that while they are in support of the rezoning and abuse, they encourage staff to look at the design and thenshort term rental regulations around abuse. The Denver zoning code has five review criteria which must be met in order for a rezoning to be approved. The first criterion is.Consistency with.Adopted plans, and there are three plans that are applicable to the site. This application is consistent with the strategies.In the.Comprehensive plan, as it will create a greater mix of housing options in the University Park neighborhood and promote infill development where there are already services and infrastructure in place. The future neighborhood context in Blueprint Denver is urban edge.These areas contain elements of both the urban and suburban contexts and are mostly single in two unit residential areas with some multi-unit and mixed use embedded throughout. Blueprint identifies the future place type as low residential. These place types are mostly single unit residential uses, and there are areas where accessory dwelling units are appropriate.And then the future street type for Monroe Street is is local. And these are mostly characterized by residential uses consistent with what the applicant is proposing. The growth area strategy is all other areas of the city. This is where we anticipate to see 10% of new employment and 20% of new housing by 2040.And then blueprint also includes specific policy recommendations. So the land use and built for housing policy.For strategy.E states that individual rezonings to allow aids are appropriate and should be small, an area which is consistent with this single site adu rezoning. And then the University Park Neighborhood Plan is also applicable to this site and designates this area as single family residential, stating that new development should be integrated into the existing character of the neighborhood. And this is consistent with the proposed rezoning, says ESU. D1 is a single unit district. Staff also finds the requested zoning meets the next two criteria. The rezoning will result in uniformity of district regulations, and it will further have a public health, safety and welfare.By providing a new housing unit that is integrated into the existing character of the area and implementing Blueprint Denver. Staff finds there's.A justifying circumstance for.This MAP amendment with the newly adopted plan guidance in Blueprint.Denver to allow aid to use throughout all.Residential neighborhoods. And then lastly, the proposed rezoning is consistent with the urban edge neighborhood context, the residential zoned districts purpose and the specific intent of the ESU de one zoned district. So based on the review criteria, staff recommends approval of the proposed rezoning.And that concludes the stock presentation.And I am available for questions.All right. Thank you, Libby. Tonight, council has received one written comment on Council Bill 464. There is one suspended comment in favor of the application and no submitted comments in opposition of the application application. All members of Council that are present have certified that they have read each of the submitted written comments.Do any members need more time in order to read all of the written testimony that was submitted? CNN council secretary let the record reflect that all written testimony, both in favor and in opposition of Council Bill 464 has been read by each member of council and all written testimony will be submitted to the official record of thehearing. We have this evening, one individual signed up to speak and our first speaker and only speaker is Tyler Higgins. Sorry for mispronounce you anyway.So that's perfect. Thank you. Hi, I'm Tyler Keegan's. I live at the property address. Just wanted to follow up real quickly that similar to the last applicant we're looking to, has a mother in law to live with us in the back of the property.It's pretty much straightforward like that, but I just want to join, say hi and and see if there are any questions as well.All right. Thank you. That concludes our speakers questions from members of Council on Council Bill 464. See no questions. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 464 Council Member Cashman.Thank you, Madam President. I do believe this application meets the requirements with with some comments in that our plans talk about ideas being appropriate to maintain the residential quality character of the neighborhood. They say its priorities are appropriate to add to our housing stock.What I'm asking is that our community planning and development folks get to work on a and a a an option where this an idea can be approved but without allowance for short term rentals. I would really like our CPD staff to do a merge with the list of accessory dwelling units with our short term rental licensing list. So we get some information to find out how these units are being used. I'm getting increasingly cranky at not having that option.

        "answer": "The meeting transcript is about the passing of Council Bill 20 1-0461 and the discussion of Council Bill 464, which is a MAP Amendment for 1880 South Monroe Street. The staff report presented by Libby Adams of Community Planning and Development outlines the request to rezone from urban edge single unit D2 to urban edge single unit RD1 to allow for an accessory dwelling unit. The rezoning meets the review criteria and is consistent with the adopted plans, including the Comprehensive Plan and Blueprint Denver. The public hearing for Council Bill 464 is open, and there is one speaker in favor of the application. Councilmember Cashman expresses support for the application but requests that the CPD staff work on an option to approve ADUs without allowing for short-term rentals. The bill is ultimately passed with nine votes in favor and none opposed.Therefore, the summary of the meeting transcripts is:\nA bill for an ordinance changing the zoning classification for 1880 South Monroe Street in University Park.\r\nApproves a map amendment to rezone property from E-SU-D to E-SU-D1 (allows for an accessory dwelling unit), located at 1880 South Monroe Street in Council District 6.

Councilman, New York, your question?Just a question, Aaron. There have been a lot of discussion about the extension of this first phase of evaluation for the Great Hall, and I didn't know whether this additional funds was related to that extension is yes.Aaron Barraza, Denver National Airport. This is adding funds to the KPMG contract as part of this extension.Okay. And in the discussion we had earlier about the reasons for the extension, I wasn't really sure what those reasons were. Could you elaborate on that?Sure. So our whole our whole idea of this pre-development phase has been to really get this done right. And so we're taking our time with this. And we've taken this project in different phases. So right now, in trying to do this right, we need to we need to go through the process about a month or two longer. And once we do that, we'll be ready to submit a development agreement to the first City Council approval. But in extending that time, we do need more funds for the KPMG, KPMG contract and for the Norseman contract.And what were the issues related to doing it right?So there was a there's three major issues. One was security. We've we have we've had some turnover in the TSA. So working with our partners at TSA and reeducating them on the project that we're doing was one of them.Customer service was another one. We don't want the Great Hall to become just another shopping center, so to speak. So we wanted to make sure that we incorporate a lot of customer service into the projects. And the third one, sorry about that, customer service security and bracing in the Great Hall.So when it comes to construction, there was a lot of unforeseen that came up during the during the pre-development phase. And so we want to make sure in doing this right, we kind of took all that bracing of construction into consideration.So these were all unforeseen issues.They were all unforeseen issues, unfortunately.Is this the total cost, the additional cost for this extension?Sorry. Can you repeat is.This the total cost for this extension, just this additional money here or thousand, or are other costs are going to be related.To this? No, they under $1,000 is the only additional cost.Thank you very much.Thank you.Thank you. Councilman new Councilman Espinosa. I see you.Might as well since you're up here. Thank you.

I wonder if there's an element there that we should be talking about in committee as well, you know.And I'll work with our committee chair as well.Wonderful. Thank you.Thank you.All right. I know, Councilwoman Ortega.I just want to say that before the construction contract comes forward, which is going to be a big contract, it will absolutely come to committee so that we can get an update of what that's going to look like.So I don't know that the project is there yet in terms of all the details. But so I'm Sabrina, uncommitted. Councilman Herndon and I are both on the committee for the Great Hall and excuse me. So I just think it's important to know that this is still part of the pre-construction.But when they get ready to bring forward a contract on the construction, we'll see all those details.And Councilman Espinosa, do you have any?Yeah, no, I certainly appreciate that. And the airport has briefed me as well in the progress. And so I'm happy to hear some of Aaron's response to sort of about the sort of over commercialization that was maybe part of previous drafts.And so because that's one of my observed concerns is where we were and where we sort of ended up. And maybe as a step back, I would love for us to see it in its evolutionary stages so that we're not getting so we're getting something akin to what I think makes Colorado a special place and a andour airport a sort of modern landmark. And we're not just converting it into something that is totally commodified. Yeah.Well, Councilman, I think I think we're definitely going to have these presentations in the business committee will definitely have them to any presentations that the councilman needs.

Parks and Public Works. Please send that to the entire council so we can look over that. Thank you. Okay, let's pull up. 778. Councilman Herndon has a comment. Go ahead. Thank you, Mr. President.I want to to invite somebody up from Catholic Charities if they're in the chambers. And I believe I see Larry in the back, if you want to come to the podium. I just I didn't have the opportunity.To come to committee for this, but I wanted to point this out. 778 is an agreement between the city and county of Denver and Catholic Charities for another homeless shelter. And two things I wanted to point out about it.One, it's in District eight. I think as we are trying to house those who do not have housing, those are the surrounding districts need to be a part of that as well.And district data is no stranger to shelters. The we have the emergency shelter has been in my district for a while but.Even more I appreciate about this. It's more than just housing those without homes. It's also about helping those. And so I want to invite Larry from Catholic Charities just to take a quick minute to describe how this shelter is different.And it's something I'm really excited about.And I appreciate the city's partnership with Catholic Charities in making this a reality. So I wanted.To give you an opportunity to speak to it.Briefly. Thank you, Councilman Hernan, and thank you, City Council. We've been working with the Office of Economic Development here at the City Councilman Herndon, a number of other Councilman Flynn in order to try and provide additional shelter for and obviously Councilman Brooks for homeless women in the city of Denver, which there is a significant need for anda growing need, unfortunately. And one of the problems that we've seen is in trying to help some of these women exit homelessness. We're running into a real struggle, a more difficult struggle than with some of the men. So in this new shelter that will be building and developing over the next several months, we're going to add anew program that hopefully will allow these women to get a leg up on exiting homelessness by giving them an additional period of recovery from substance abuse and the homelessness that they're currently experiencing, where all they have to do is come into the shelter and be safe and sober and let us take care of them for 30 dayswhile they recover from what's been going on. And what will what we're hoping to have happen is that in doing so, we'll see a much greater success rate in helping these women exit homelessness. And today, that is a very broad swath of women that were experiencing homelessness due to three primary reasons the loss of a job increasein housing and a break up of a relationship. And when that happens. And they find themselves on. The Street's very bad things happened to them. And now getting out of that becomes a real, you know, downward spiral. So this new program in shelter, with the help of the Council and the Office of Economic Development and Denver's RoadHome and Bennie Milner has been very helpful in working through this, will hopefully allow us to begin to increase the number of women who'll be able to exit homelessness successfully. So your vote and support tonight would be very helpful in helping us get there and helping these women in a service that is greatly needed right now inthe city of Denver. Thank you. Thank you so much.And Mr. Perez, I just wanted to let I know I saw a lot of all councilmembers attended, but certainly a great model for success. And I hope it's something as we prove it's successful, you know, shelter and services in one location, it certainly can be replicated.So kudos to Catholic Charities and Ed for helping with the finances to make this a reality.Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Herndon. I think we have Councilwoman Ortega.Yes. I have a couple of questions for you. Can you tell us how many shelter beds this will provide? How many women can be served at one time?Sure. Currently, we serve about 100 women at the Holy Rosary at Samaritan House in partnership with Denver Road Home. We're operating a shelter on Pecos that serves somewhere around 100, 220, 130 women a night. That building is going to cease to be available to us as a shelter.And so the Smith Road Facility, which we are purchasing and renovating, will allow us to serve 150 women every night, which will be an additional 30 women on average. And then we have other facilities that we're bringing online over the course of the next several months and year that will give us group home capacity as well tohelp these women exit homelessness.Right. So I wanted to ask a question about. How the outreach is happening that will target the people who the women who actually need the services. I walk Sloan's Lake every morning and there's an elderly woman who literally sleeps under the bridge and gets up and has her own cart and has been there for a number ofyears. And, you know, I know that historically our street outreach has primarily concentrated on the downtown, but we have some of our chronic homeless that, you know, have have left the downtown. They're in our parks. They're they're kind of hidden a lot more so now.And my hope is that these are some of the very people, because when they end up in our emergency room or in our detox facility, it actually costs us a lot more than it is to house them. And so I'm just curious how that piece of it is going to be handled so that it's not just peoplewho are downtown.Right. Well, thank you for the question, first of all. And secondly, I would tell you that we work with Denver's Road Home on an outreach program. Since we opened December of 14, 2014, since the very day that we opened the first Holy Rosary Women's Shelter at Samaritan House.We have not had an empty bed, and many nights we wind up moving chairs and tables out of conference rooms so that we can facilitate these women. I'm happy to say, unfortunately, that we've never turned a woman away.I say unfortunately, because that means that, you know, there are so many out there that need help, but we're always there to help them and we will put them up no matter when they come in to the facility.The Smith Road facility, you know, is a bust in facility. There's no walk up. So these women will gather at Samaritan House where we provide a hot meal in the evening. Then the women that can fit into the Samaritan House shelter at on Lawrence, of course, will stay there and the rest are then bussed out to thefacility on Smith Road. But no walkup traffic is allowed out there from an outreach standpoint. You know, we do there is a street traffic network that these women know about. And as soon as we open up new beds, they're immediately filled.And the other thing, Councilman Ortega, it's important to point out is that we have an extended stay program that once they are sober and are able to, you know, recognize their plight and reach out for help to get out of it.We have a four month program that we move these women through very successfully. Once they get past that first 30 day period, we're seeing a success rate in the high 80th percentile who live with stable income. Unfortunately, housing is a bit more of a struggle because of the increase in housing in Denver.So I'm also happy to tell you that Denver Catholic Charities has 27 apartment buildings that we manage, and now we're working with HUD to develop a housing first initiative for the homeless that will allow them to get first in our waiting list for our newest property, which is over on South Federal and Councilman Flynn's district.It's called Golden Spike. And we're setting aside 40 units for women and homeless people in general who are exiting homelessness will then be able to move up on that waiting list. The actual outreach, though, is done through a network of street communication and then also with Denver Road Home, where they send people out to to find thesepeople that are homeless. And we can always expand that and try and do a better job in the outreaches of the city.Well, I just want to commend Catholic Charities for their efforts in moving this project forward. We absolutely know the need is incredible, and I'm sure the women just can't wait for the facility to open. Thank you.Thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega and Councilman Herndon. Okay. All right. We can bring up Bill. Council Bill seven 5778 on final. And Councilwoman Ortega wanted to put this on for Councilwoman Sussman, will you please put council bill 757 and 758 on the floor for final consideration and do pass?\nReasoning:Reasoning:",

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThank you. By your vote, we've given a do pass recommendation to a motion 2020 299. We will expedite that to full council next Tuesday and place it on consent. It takes us to item ten. Our final agenda item for today is a motion that would revise the appointment process for the District and Committee, which redraws the CountyCouncil district boundaries every ten years informed by the annual the decimal census. Patrick Hamacher, the director of Council Initiatives, is here to provide this report. Mr. Hamacher, the screen is yours. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and council members. Good afternoon.Patrick Hamacher, Council Staff. The materials for this item are at the end of your packet and they begin on page 163. The county charter, as you noted in.Your introduction.Requires that the district for the offices of County Council member be redrawn every ten years. The next time they need to be redrawn is by the end of 2021. So coming up prior to 2008 and the passage of Initiative 26, the office was actually a partizan office.So council members would run as as a representative of their political parties. Council Initiative 26 made the offices nonpartizan. However, the code has never been updated to remove the partizan references from the code section pertaining to redistricting and actually calls for PARTIZAN appointments to the District and Commission to fully understand what the district doing process requires.You actually need to reference state law, the county charter and county code. And so just by way of background, a quickly go through that state law and the charter. And now on the bottom of page one, 63 state law and the charter both require require a district due process every ten years.RTW 29 876 actually lays out criteria that any district team process must meet and the highlights of those districts district requirements are laid out on the bottom there. I'll go over them very quickly. The population in each district must be as equal as possible.Districts must be as compact as possible. Districts must be geographic. Must be a geographical contiguous area. Population data cannot be used to favor or disfavor one racial group. Population data must be not used to favor or disfavor one political party.And to the extent possible, districts should use existing natural boundaries and preserve existing communities of related and mutual interest. So those are the criteria laid out in state law. And largely what that does in Washington state is prevent some of the kind of crazy, crazily drawn, gerrymandered districts that you might see, particularly with congressional districts and otherstates. The district can process also has criteria laid out in the county charter. So I've now moved on to page 164. On the top of the page there, Section 650 of the county charter lays out the criteria of the district being process, and it requires a district in committee to be appointed every ten years.The next one, as we noted, coming up at the beginning of 2021. The council under this process appoints four members, and those four members appoint the fifth member who serves as chair of the district being committee. The committee also needs to select what the charter calls a district master.In this case, think of it as a person or firm that actually is responsible for drawing the maps and coming up with coming up with a district to report which which approves the new districts. And the work must be complete by December 31st of the year, the committee begins.So in this case, it would need to be completed by December 31st of next year. Finally, the part that is covered by this ordinance, Section 122 of the King County Code places additional criteria on the membership and the appointment process for the district in committee.There are two key provisions there. Each council member may nominate someone from the council members political party and the county council shall appoint two Republican and two Democratic nominees to the committee. So those two provisions are essentially the bulk of what's in Section 122 of the code, and both would be changed by the proposed ordinance as beforethe before the committee now just four years. And because it's a relatively straightforward matter, I've actually included towards the bottom of page 164, I've included how each section would look as affected by this ordinance. And so the first section would be amended to add a little bit of process around the appointment process, and it would include newlanguage that it would see by December 1st, December 1st of the December preceding a district in committee process. So that's a little clunky, but it's because of how it's drawn. So it would be this December by written notice to the chair of the council.Each council member may nominate a person to serve on the district committee. So what gets removed there is of the council members political party and that the chair of the council show cause to be introduced or introduce a motion for consideration and action by the Council that appoints the District Committee as described in the next section.So that would be the process where the Council would appoint the four members that are the council appointees. Those four members would then go on to appoint the remaining member. The moving to now, page 165, the second section of KCC 122 would be amended to remove, as it's shown there, the requirement that two appointees from each ofthe Democratic and Republican Party parties be nominated and instead replace that language with language cover that states. In appointing the members of the committee, the Council should consider equity and attempt to represent the demographic, geographic and political diversity of the county, and also that appointees to the committee should have a history of civic or community engagement andhave the necessary background and skill to actively participate in the district due process. So those are the bulk of the changes. Those are all of the changes actually that would be made by this ordinance. And it would bring the.Remaining section or the King County Code in compliance with the Charter as it was amended by Initiative 26. So taken together in the last section of this staff report, I just want to cover what the new process for districting would look like if this ordinance were passed.So step one, by December of this year, each of the County Council members may nominate by, in writing to the chair of the council, someone to serve on the committee. The Council chair would then introduce or caused to be introduced a motion appointing four four members of the committee.The charter lays out that those members must be appointed by the end of January of next year. So sometime between December and the end of January, you would need to appoint the four members. Those four members will then vote to pick the fifth member of the District Committee who would serve as chair.By April, the committee, the district committee should appoint the district master. And by the if for some reason the District Committee can't appoint the District Master by April one. The Council is then charged with selecting someone by the end of May.Hopefully that wouldn't come into play, but it's at least in the code structure, a section of the charter. And then by December 31, the District D.M. submits a plan to the committee. The committee must then adopt the plan with or without amendment within 15 days.So technically, this process could trickle over into the very early part of 2022 if the district master does not submit the plan until the very end of 2021, and that once the plan is approved by the committee and submitted to the clerk, the those become the new council districts.So in terms of the election schedule, these would probably not be the council districts until the 2023 council elections, unless somehow the district committee completed its work incredibly quickly, in other words, before the open enrollment or the registration period for the 2021 elections.Which seems incredibly unlikely considering the work they would have to do. That concludes my staff report. Mr. Chair. Leonard Cohen from our legal counsel, it makes sense from the prosecutor's office, did a lot of help in helping to prepare this ordinance.So I just want to recognize their work as well, and I'd be happy to answer any questions. Thank you, Mr. Hamacher. Questions, colleagues. Councilmember Balducci for a motion.Thank you, Mr. Chairman, of adoption of proposed ordinance number 2020 DASH 0298 with a do pass recommendation.Councilmember Bell Duties Moved Adoption of Motion 2020 298 with the due pass recommendation. Discussion.Let me speak to it.Councilmember Banducci.Mr. Harker covered this really pretty well, but just for the purposes of those following law, this comes forward because we do every ten years adopt district boundaries for the districts within the Kane County Council. And ten years ago our charter had been changed to remove reference to these positions as being partizan, Democrat or Republican.But it wasn't fully implemented yet. Half of the council had switched over to nonpartisan, but there were still members on the council who were nominally Democrats and Republicans. And so the last charter commissioner and chair of the last District Commission retained this language around appointing two Democrats and two Republicans.But we are fully nonpartisan now, as is the rest of all of the elected officials in acting, as are the rest of all the elected officials in King County. So this proposal thinks our ordinance and our process with our charter, and because the only requirements to be appointed in the ordinance prior to this change were that twoof them be Democrats and two of them be Republicans. We have added some some language that is flexible enough that we can select people who are good and who bring a variety of backgrounds, experience, etc.. But, you know, also tell us a little bit about qualifications.So I urge your support and will be as we get through budget and all the other budgets that Councilmember Caldwell's was laying out today, we will also be starting to stand up our redistricting committees.Thank you. See no further questions. And would you please call the roll?Thank you, Mr. Chair. Councilmember Belushi.Hi.Councilmember DEMBOSKY.Hi.Councilmember Dunn.I.Councilmember calls I council member Lambert high council member of the growth I. Councilmember one right there.I.Councilman Rizal.I.Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, the vote is 19 zero noes.Thank you. By your vote, we've given a do pass recommendation to motion 2020 298. We will expedite that to full council next Tuesday and put it on consent. That concludes the action items in today's agenda. I want to make sure that we haven't lost any votes due to technical difficulties.Madam Clerk, do you have all votes recorded?Yes, Mr. Chair. All votes have been recorded.All right, with all votes recorded and knowing of no other business to come before the council, I want to thank everyone who has participated in today's council meeting and we are adjourned. Thank you, everyone.\nReasoning:Reasoning:",
        "answer": "The meeting transcript discusses a motion to revise the appointment process for the District and Committee responsible for redrawing the County Council district boundaries every ten years. The current process is outdated and needs to be updated to comply with the County Charter, which requires that the district for the offices of County Council member be redrawn every ten years. The proposed ordinance would remove partizan references from the code section pertaining to redistricting and replace them with language that considers equity and attempts to represent the demographic, geographic, and political diversity of the county. The meeting concludes with the council voting in favor of the motion with a do pass recommendation.Therefore, the summary of the meeting transcripts is:\nAN ORDINANCE revising the appointment process for the districting committee; and amending Ordinance 5327, Section 1, as amended, and K.C.C. 1.22.010."

And now let's move to proclamations. We have two proclamations this evening, and I have the honor of reading the first one Proclamation 449 Honoring Philip s miller, M.D. f ACP fh ed on the occasion of his retirement, whereas Dr. Philip s Maler began his career 27 years ago with Denver General.We all remember it as Denver General, during which time he has served in many assignments, including staff attending physician Glassman, Professor of Medicine and Endowed Chair Denver Health and Department of Medicine. University of Colorado School of Medicine. Associate Dean.University of Colorado School of Medicine. Professor of Infectious Disease and Medical Director and Chief Clinical Officer. And. Whereas, Dr. Miller is nationally renowned as the expert in eating disorders and has saved many lives of people who have suffered from this disease.And. Whereas, Dr. Miller is a prolific academician, having published over 350 articles in peer reviewed journal journals and also is an accomplished professor of medicine with an international reputation for excellence in research, education and clinical care. And. Whereas, Dr. Miller has trained hundreds of interns, residents and fellows to be physicians of medicine.And. WHEREAS, Dr. Mailer's leadership abilities have led to the creation of a world class facility supported by world class physicians and staff, many of whom have devoted their entire careers to Denver Health and its patients, providing compassionate state of the art and equitable medical care to thousands of patients, including the current mayor, Michael B, Hancock governors andcity council members. And. Whereas, as a result of Dr. Mailer's work, Denver Health became a truly integrated health care system, which resulted in it becoming a model health care organization for the nation. And. Whereas, Dr. Mailer has received many awards and commendations, including being on the list of Denver's top doctors of internal medicine in our 50 to80 magazine, who's who among executives and professionals, the best doctors in America and internal medicine, just to name a few. And. Whereas, this city will miss his leadership, his ability to create the future of health care, and importantly, his constant dedication to our patients and the true mission of Denver health.Now, therefore, be it proclaimed by the Council of the City and County of Denver, Section one, the Denver City Council hereby recognizes Dr. Mailer for his contributions. To Denver's communities in countless ways, personally and professionally, to keep Denver's residents healthy.And for his professional and personal dedication to the city and county of Denver, the state of Colorado and the nation.

And a fix the seal of the city and county of Denver to this proclamation and that a copy be transmitted to Dr. Philip s mailer, M.D. Frcp an faa e d and having read the proclamation, I move the proclamation 449 be adopted.Second, it has been moved and seconded. We now have comments from the council members and I will go first. I am very, very happy to be able to do this for Dr. Mailer. He is my constituent, so that makes him even more special.But your history and your career are amazing. Outstanding, excellent. That service that you give in our city is above and beyond. And we can't thank you enough. We will miss you greatly. And I'm so glad to be able to do this proclamation this evening.And I see no other comments. Madam Secretary, roll call. Oh, no, I do see a comment a little bit coming in late. Councilwoman Ortega.Thank you, Madam President. Sorry, I was trying to switch from one screen to the other. First of all, I want to ask that my name be added to the proclamation. Certainly. I just want to express my gratitude and appreciation to Dr. Taylor for his 27 years of service to the city of Denver.It takes very special people who want to do this work and commit their profession and their lifetime history to working with the population at Denver Health Serves. And I think we all owe a great debt of gratitude to you.So thank you very much.Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Madam Secretary, roll call.Madam President, high growth round, high fat.

The proclamation is adopted, and I would like to call on Dr. Gonzalez, I believe, to the podium. I think you have a few words to say about Dr. Mailer.Madam President, members of council, it's a delight for me to be here and join you in this proclamation. We've had several ceremonies and events for Dr. Mahler honoring him, and it was a real pleasure to see all of his colleagues, his former students, all of the employees come and visit and wish him well wishes.I think the proclamation speaks for itself in terms of all of his accomplishments as a researcher, as an educator, and also, first and foremost, his love of taking care of patients. But the one thing I'd like to add is I've gotten to know him over the last 18 months, and he's a person of very high integrity andcharacter, caring deeply about the work that he does and about the patients that he takes care of. And as someone mentioned earlier, that it's a special calling for someone to do that and do that so well for so very long.Finally, it's my pleasure to announce to you that after a lot of conversations with Dr. Miller that he will be staying on at Denver Health in a part time basis, post-retirement, after he enjoys a little time off with his family.And he'll be still the director of the Acute Eating Disorders Center. And it's a pleasure to be able to retain him for the benefit of all in Denver, who needs his service and those from around the country who come as well.So we certainly wish him our very best and it's a pleasure to be able to be here and celebrate this with him tonight. And some of his family members are here, too.Thank you. Dr. Gonzales, sounds like we don't have to go cold turkey and without his services. Dr. Miller, would you like to come up to the podium?Good afternoon or good evening, I guess. Thank you for this honor. I'm a native Denver. I was born in St Anthony's and grew up in the west side of Denver. Went to see you night school. I worked as a butcher up in 50th in Washington for five years when I was going through night school.And then I went to see U. Medical School when I was a resident and then joined Denver General at the time. I walked into Denver General for the first time when I was a third year medical student in 1982, my pediatric rotation and fell in love with the place and never left.So it's been a 34 year marriage for me, including residency and student time. And it's truly been a an honor and a privilege for me to serve the institution, to serve its patients, to serve its medical staff and all the other staff.5500 people that work at Denver Health. Denver Health is a jewel locally. It's well acclaimed nationally and deservedly so. We practice terrific medicine there. We have a wonderful nursing staff. We have a wonderful administrative staff and medical staff there.And Denver really can be very proud of Denver Health that although we've taken care of the DISENFRANCHIZED for many years, we've never lost sight of the fact that our sacred pact in life is to heal and to heal everybody, regardless of their ability to pay.And that's been my calling in life, and I'm very privileged that I've been able to spend my entire career there. And with the exaltation of Dr. Gonzales and his staff, I'm going to be staying on on a part time basis, continuing to take care of the folks that I've worked with for about 30 years, those with severeanorexia nervosa and bulimia. And we have a center at Denver Health Medical Center that has no replica in the United States. It's the only medical stabilization program like itself in the United States where we take critically ill patients and restore them to life.About 30% of our patients come by air ambulance from other cities and states in the United States. And it truly speaks volumes about the quality of care of Denver health. So thank you for this honor. I'm eternally grateful for Your Honor, and I'm eternally grateful for the opportunity that's been given to me to work at Denver Healthfor all these years. Thank you very much.Thank you very much.Madam President. Yes? We will get a chance to meet.Whose family didn't get a chance to meet his family. Would you like to hear what? The family with the family members of Dr. Miller, please stand.One family member is. Very, very. Thank you very much. Thank you as well.Okay. We have a second proclamation number for 77 and I'll call on Councilman Brown.Thank you, Madam President. This is a proclamation recognizing the 80th anniversary of Southeast Denver's Bonnie Breed Tavern, where as local diners have always played a vital role in the economic and social life of a neighborhood.

Item 11.Communication from Councilwoman Mongeau, Councilwoman Zendejas Councilmember Your Urunga recommendation directs city manager to review and report back within 90 days on parks, roadway and parking lot maintenance.Councilwoman.Thank you. I was trying to text. Motion to the Q. Thank you for everyone who has contributed to this item. Our community has really reached out related to some challenges that we have found in understanding how. Potholes that are not on residential and commercial corridors, residential streets, commercial corridors or the other types of public streets that wehave actually get filled. We've been working on a particular pothole for months, and sometimes these potholes get reported through the garbage out hundreds of times and still no resolution. And that's just not acceptable. I know that interior roads and our park facilities and our our parking lots often have some of the worst potholes in the city.And while I'm not looking to pull resources from one area to another, I think it's important for there to be a united method in which people can communicate with the city about a pothole and the need to repair it.Because what's happening is a pothole reported at a small size left unrepaired for months on end, actually grows to a size where the cost of repairing that pothole has grown exponentially. So we really need to figure out how to pull together a united pothole program.I think that's kind of the theme of my two items tonight, which is understanding that within our city we do a lot of great things, but sometimes they're broken up into different departments and this is one of those times.And so I'd like the city manager to look at that and come back and. He's already committed to filling the pothole issue that we have. That's been an ongoing issue, but that issues like this should not be bounced around from public works to Parks and Rec for months on end, with residents feeling totally disenfranchized and frustrated.So I appreciate everyone's support on this important item.Thank you. Councilmember Zendejas.I just wanted to say thank you to Councilmember Mongo for bringing this item forward, and I just wanted to second her motion.Thank you.

Honoring Transgender Day of Remembrance and celebrating the contributions and resilience of Denver's transgender community. Whereas Transgender Day of Remembrance will be observed on November 20th, 2017, to honor the memory of those whose lives were lost in acts of Anti-Transgender violence, an annual event which began in 1998 with a vigil tohonor the memory of Rita Hester, a transgender woman who was killed and which now honors all transgender people lost to violence. And. Whereas, a formal vigil honoring those who were lost and the loved ones they left behind will be hosted by the Gender Identity Center on November 20th at 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. with a reception tofollow at East High School. 1600 City Park Esplanade, Denver. And. Whereas, our entire community is diminished when we lose the talents and contributions of any member of our community prematurely, whether due to direct anti-transgender violence or due to suicide or other health effects resulting from trauma or discrimination.And. WHEREAS, Denver honors the bravery and resilience of the thousands of transgender individuals who live, work or play in our city in their authentic gender. And although we are proud of the existing protections we have in place for transgender individuals to pursue their lives free from discrimination in Denver and in Colorado, we reaffirm a commitment to ongoingefforts to promote full inclusion of transgender individuals in the city. And. WHEREAS, we honor the outstanding organizations that serve as resources to transgender individuals in Denver, including the Gender Identity Center of Colorado, which specializes in providing critical supports and services to the transgender community.The GLB Community Center of Colorado, which opened in 1976 and has grown to become the largest community center in the Rocky Mountain region and provides social, educational and support programs for the transgender community. One Colorado, a leading advocacy organization for LGBTQ Coloradans and their families, which works to expand health care access for transgender Coloradans and to removeother barriers they face in everyday life and the work of our own LGBTQ commission, which partners with the community to advance social, economic and political equality through their unique position within the city and county of Denver. Now, therefore, be it proclaimed by the City Council of the City and County of Denver, that section one that the citycouncil, the city and county of Denver solemnly declares November 20th as Transgender Day of Remembrance and Section two that the Clerk of the city and county of Denver shall a test and a fix the seal of the city and county of Denver to this proclamation, and that a copy be delivered to the LGBT Community Center of Colorado, the Gender Identity Center of Colorado, one Colorado and the Denver LGBTQ Commission.Thank you. Councilwoman, your motion to adopt.I move that proclamation 1287 be adopted.It has been moved in second comments by members of Council Council McNeish.Thank you, Mr. President. It is with mixed emotions that we consider this proclamation tonight. According to the Human Rights Campaign funds, there have been 25 murders of transgender individuals in our country so far this year. That's an uptick from last year, which was an uptick from the year before.The vast majority of these victims have been people of color. And even more disturbing disparity of race in the gender identity homicides that have occurred. The loss of these lives, these talents, these contributions is a tragedy for the victims and their loved ones, and it highlights significant failures in our country.The epidemic of transgender violence, unfortunately, begins young. About 16.2% of transgender students experience physical assaults at school, while 32.5% experience physical harassment. But in the midst of all these threats, there is hope. There has been so much this year that has been demonstrating the bravery of our transgender community.Coming on the heels of Veterans Day, we have out transgender service individuals who are fighting and so far winning in the courts to keep fighting for our freedoms. At a time when the civilian leader of the military has tried to kick them out and terminate their careers.They are fighting and they are winning. Danica Roem is poised to be the first transgender individual elected and to serve in a state legislature when she takes office in the Virginia House of Delegates. She defeated a legislator who tried to stoke fear and deprive transgender individuals of the basic right to use a bathroom that matches their gender. Now here in Colorado, we have a long, good history. Demonstrate discrimination based on gender identity or expression has been prohibited since 2008. Brave transgender children, their parents, teens and adults continue to work for greater inclusion in schools and in health care.There are trainings that are happening every day. There are inclusive health care policies available on the exchange right now today because of the work of these families. But what we know is that misunderstanding and fear still exists. We know this because subtle and overt discrimination still occur in our city, in our state.So in addition to the violence the state was founded to bring attention to, yes, this proclamation is a tribute to those who've been lost or harmed. Yes, it's a celebration of the bravery of transgender people who go to.Work, go to.School, walk down the street, serve in the military, run for office, seek shelter, or do anything they need to do in their daily lives, in their authentic gender. We celebrate that. But it's also a call to action. What are we doing to expand our own understanding of transgender neighbors and coworkers?How do we understand the terminology and use the proper pronouns when we are talking about friends or loved ones? Are we actively supporting the fight of our community to be both? To be able to adjust birth certificates? There are bills at the legislature that have been shut down for several sessions to do the simple thing of changingsomeone's birth certificate so they can match their gender. The state has not yet passed that legislation. Are we helping? Are we are we writing our legislators? Do we challenge derogatory language or rigid gender expectations when we hear it in our everyday lives?So I'm really proud that our council is not just hosting this proclamation tonight, but we're going to work to educate ourselves better. We're going to hold a training in a few weeks open to all the city council family to learn more about this piece of our community and to understand what their needs are and how we canbetter serve them. And so all of the organizations that are here today are resources to you. If you think you might want to do some of the same training, I encourage you to reach out. So I think these community serving organizations and I think the brave individuals who live their lives each day in spite of the challengesand give us hope to continue to work towards that future that we all believe in. And with that, I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to bring this proclamation forward tonight.Thank you, Councilwoman. Can each councilman. Clerk.Thank you, Mr. President. I can't say anything better than what the proclamation did or what you just did. Councilwoman Canady. So I just wanted to say thank you so much for bringing this forward, for leading on this. And I'm very proud to sit up here with you today and support this proclamation in this community.Thank you.All right. Councilwoman Ortega?Well, I want to say ditto to that, but I also want to acknowledge the body of council that sat here and adopted the original ordinance that created equal protection for. Everyone in our community, especially our LGBTQ community. And Kathy Reynolds was the catalyst that brought that legislation forward.Her staff person, Judy Gold, worked very hard with the community to get that legislation passed. As you know, it was challenged all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, and we prevailed. And so I just think it's important to always, you know, remember some of the folks that did the heavy lifting on what has been duplicated andreplicated across the country, where folks recognize the importance of honoring the contributions of everyone. Thank you.Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega, Councilor Lopez.Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for bringing this proclamation forward. I think it's a very powerful statement from the council. It's a statement of solidarity and which I am proud to stand in solidarity with the community. I think it's super important that we not only passes, but we communicate this in a way so that other cities mayaspire to do the same thing in not just in Colorado, but around the country. I think Denver is a very important regional city. And people people follow our lead when it comes to stuff like this. They're just waiting on some cities to take the first step.You know, we're not the first step, but I think we're an important step. And with this proclamation moving forward, I think, you know, councilman can use this. This is a very strong moment for us. But also, I think I can only think of one word when I think of this struggle and that self-determination and the right toself-determination. Right. There's no human being in this world that should be stripped of that right, of human, of of self-determination, let alone in this country, where we have a constitution that enhances that empowers us self-determination. So here's to that solidarity.Thank you, Councilman Kenny, for the proclamation.All right. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Thank you, Councilwoman Canete. Let the church say amen. Madam Secretary, roll call. Say louder.Can each.I.Lopez I knew.Ortega Hey, man.Sussman.Sussman My black eye.Clark Hi. Espinosa.Flynn, I.Gillmor. Herndon. Cashman.Hi.Mr. President.Hey, man.

The Gender Identity Center of Colorado is going to represent all of the organizations being honored. Is Jesse here or Karen and Julie, do you want to go up?Okay.Please. Right to the microphone there. Thank you.Thank you council members.For the proclamation. Hmm. You know, there's nothing that the transgender community needs more than support from everyone else. If it's the one thing that we lack, we are center can take care of helping people.We can give counseling.We have support groups. But what we don't.Have sometimes is.Support of other people in the community. And if there's anything that's really important, that's it. And so this proclamation.While it may not seem like a lot.Means a real lot to us.And if from my.Hand because it helps raise the poker public awareness of the violence and discrimination that our community.Experiences pretty much every hour of every day, not just here, but also across the world. So thank you so much for.Helping us do that. And I also want to mention, and I think you did mention that we're having.The Transgender Day of Remembrance at.East High School at 630 on Monday the 20th.And can you share who the keynote speaker is?The keynote speaker is going to be Leyla Ireland. And for those of you who may not know who she is, she's a veteran. That's a trans woman. Her husband is a serving veteran that is a trans masculine person.So he's in jeopardy of losing his job. And they're doing a lot to fight for that.Thank you. We got your back. All right. Great. Thank you. Excellent. Thank you, Councilwoman. All right, we're on to the second proclamation. I'm going to have Councilman Ortega please read Proclamation 1290.\nReasoning:Reasoning:",

The city council directed staff to do a three week request for qualification for the development of West Midway. And that and that was for the three development teams that had responded previously.And we're still interested in being involved in the development. On March 9th, SAP issued an updated RFQ, and on March 30th, staff received two developer statements of qualifications, one from a partnership.At Personal Properties in September.And another five for equity investment. A city selection panel review to the two. As of Tuesday, April 9th, we did an interview with each developer on.WebEx.And tonight recommending the team of Brookfield to tell us about the development process. By the way, project and for the following reasons they were selected. First, they demonstrated that they spent a significant amount of time evaluating and planning the land uses and basing concepts that would meet both the goals of the Reshape and the West Midway Project. And they engaged a significant amount of time with the collaborating partners in discussions. They also demonstrated a well informed grasp of challenges and issues that were.That could they.Could face and possibly came up with mitigations that were that could possibly.Address them.

Although Alameda Point Collaborative recused itself from reviewing the proposals due to conflict of interest, the remaining collaborating partners provided feedback and ensured that the selected team has the capacity to complete the needed infrastructure work.We were impressed by the thoughtfulness of the Brookfield Cattell proposal and we look forward to working with them to revise our vision of rebuilding the existing supportive housing and creating a vibrant new community.

But I don't want the public to know that even though we may not talk a lot about this, we've all given a lot of thought to this. I mean, we had four developers come as finalists that staff could not recommend a while back, and I couldn't even pick between them. And we had a subcommittee and, you know, the two people that we did want to move forward fell through. But two of the other finalists, you know, are the two that are still here today. So they've gone through this not once, but twice.So I appreciate that they hung in with us. And I'm glad that we not.Only.Didn't have to choose between them, but now that we're going to get the best of both worlds and that they're going to be joining forces. And between their equity and their experience and their know how.

Councilmember de. So give your hand that.It's just a quick comment. I just want to say through the RFQ process, I appreciated how certain concepts that Councilmember Odie and myself had raised were included in that. Councilmember O'Day, for example, raised the notion of that the developer will build in financial and market flexibility into the project, and that's in the RFQ.And then I had raised the notion of wanting to see how the developer, what kind of plans that they have with regard to achieving social justice goals. So as we move forward and the specific plans, I look forward to seeing how those are fleshed out.Thank you. Thank you. Vice Mayor, anything from you? Briefly.I will just say that I am excited to see this moving forward to Councilmember Otis Point because of all the thought, you know, just making sure it's clear, you know, there are lots of reasons we want to see this moving forward.The RESHAPE program that this will support, I think is another one. Also, one of the two folks that we're moving forward has had by far the best tagline of the entire RFQ process here. So do we know your dirt?I have never forgotten that. And you know what? Marketing wins, I guess.And and for me, I am just so pleased to see this move forward. This the reshape neighborhood has been such an important, integral part of what we do so well in Alameda. We when the Navy base closed, we didn't say that we would pay money to have homeless individuals not in our backyard.We said, nope, we'll we'll provide housing. Now, all these years, it's been not that most ideal housing, but yet roofs overhead. And we've sheltered many families and individuals in need and we continue to do so. But I'm very I'm very pleased to to support this.And I think all of your comments just really capture the important work that we.Are.Moving forward with now. And as I have said, more than once, this COVID 19 crisis has only highlighted our state, the Bay Area's dire need for more housing. So let's get moving on this as quickly as possible.

The chair now recognizes. Councilor Flynn. Councilor Flynn, you have the floor.Thank you. Thank you. Counsel. Royal counsel, royal counselor Fernando Fernandez Anderson as an original co-sponsor.Seeing no objection, she is now added.Thank you. Many, many know that I represent the largest AAPI community in Boston. Mostly in Chinatown, but also in the South End in itself, Boston as well. Outside of my district, we have a vibrant Vietnamese community that's in council, a baker's district.Um, and Councilor Braden also has a large Korean community as well. And council has a large AAPI community, as do other councilors. There's a large Cambodian community outside of Boston, up and up in Lowell. Um, over the weekend, I had the opportunity to attend.The Asian Jade Banquet, which is a celebration of Asian police officers throughout New England. And they came together and talked about the important role of Asian and Asian-American police officers that play in our cities and towns. And they do an exceptional job.But I always come back to. A story that I have said several times. But when the Chinese community first came to the United States. They helped build the United States, literally with the transcontinental railroad. And Chinese laborers along with Irish laborers.Connected the East Coast and in the West Coast, and they connected up a bit outside of Salt Lake City. And there's this there's a famous photo of kind of a ribbon cutting ceremony completing completing the railroad. And there's about 200 people in one of these old photos.And of the 200 people, there's not one Asian person in the photo, even though they practically built and built the railroad. And after that, after completing the railroad, what did the U.S. government do? We enacted the Chinese Exclusion Act.What Chip scored in Chinese from coming to the United States was the first time that the United States intentionally excluded an ethnic an ethnic group from coming in here. We also during the during World War Two, we imprisoned Japanese Americans, mostly out in the West Coast, in California, in some other some other states as well, even thoughthey were born here. Um. During this pandemic. We actually held the first public town hall meeting on COVID 19 in the country. And there was a Josiah Quincy School, and there was a young woman. She was a student at the Boston Latin at Boston Latin Academy.And this was in January 2020. And. COVID really didn't hit this part of the United States yet. But we we knew it was coming. And this student got on the train heading to school when she got on the train.She walked into the train and all the other people on the train got off the train. Because they associated her with with COVID 19. She was a young kid, probably 16 to 17 years old, telling telling me that story at this at this town hall.And then I thought to myself, you know, we're going to see a lot of anti-Asian racism in this country. anti-Asian hate hate crimes. That have happened here in the city of Boston, not just with the AAPI community, with immigrants, with communities of color as well, LGBTQ as Council of Clarity, as I mentioned also, um, and these, thesehate crimes against immigrants continue to this day. I was at a hearing the other night and an elderly Asian woman was visiting Boston. I think she lived in Somerville. She was probably 80 years old. She got punched in the head by a young guy, probably, probably 20 years old, just just because she was Asian.But what I but what I want to do as we celebrate AAPI. Certainly we have to deal with the discrimination and the hate crimes, but also to celebrate the important role the Asian community has played in the United States, the contributions and the sacrifices that they made for our city and for our country.So I'm proud to partner with Counselor Fernandez Anderson. But I also want to say to my colleagues, I know you, you have also supported the AAPI community, not just today or this month, but for all of the year.So I want to recognize my colleagues for the tremendous work they do in this field. And I also want to recognize our first mayor of the city of Boston, Mayor Malveaux, who with have partnered on this resolution many times before.But I just want to say thank you to the mayor for her important work as well. So thank you. Mr.. Thank you also for giving me the opportunity to speak.Thank you, Councilor Flynn. The Chair now recognizes Councilor Fernandez Anderson.Thank you. Uh, Councilor. Sorry, President Flynn, for filing this resolution. And I just wanted to take a moment to just, you know, sort of now go by the formalities and just express my sentiment around this. When I arrived to the United States and did not and I was looking for a job to save money so that Ican bring my brother or sister. And I would save every little bit. And I didn't have a green card, so I would I found a way and there was a few friends in Cambridge that I met some Bengalis and and other Nepalese friends that had hooked me up with some jobs and we would all work together.And of course, the joke was that immigrants that we work two or three jobs and sometimes we're called, you know, people would say, are you Jamaican if you work more than three jobs, right. So we all share this culture of working hard and being disciplined and putting out, you know, a lot of work because of our, youknow, ethics or work ethics in terms of being disciplined in putting out work. But I a lot of my friends also share the sentiment. And as you know, Muslims being highly Asian or Asian Pacific Islanders share this expression that or the sentiment that.Because where because they work very hard and because they are disciplined or humble in the way that they ask for recognition that they are not recognized as human beings for the work that they put out. And not to repeat everything that often has said.But I was really happy that you mentioned all of the different historic contributions to the United States and building this country, but also all of the hardships that people have gone through. And I think that a lot of the times we human as human beings, we're not very good with the unknown.So we wait for this paradigm shift to take us to, oh, wait, it's wrong to discriminate against LGBTQ. Ah, oh, wait, it's wrong to be. To discriminate against blacks. Oh, it's wrong to be this way or that way.So I think that we should try to get into the culture of being open and understanding that there are nuances. As and as Counselor Laura has mentioned, we're not a monolith. So that's not to any and that's to every group.Everybody. There's nuances and culture and differences and music and food and everybody's different. And I think what happens is we we tend to clump up people in one category or one bucket Asians, that's it. But there's so much beauty and diversity and language and culture that comes with the different type that different Asians and Asian Pacific Islanders. I'm so happy to partner with you in this and thank you so much, so much for your work. But not just because you're not just because you represent a lot of Asians, but because you're you are a very kind man.Castle Flynn. And I really just appreciate you for taking the time and not it's not about faults for you. It's like this. These are people I represent and I'm going to do that to the best of my ability with heart and passion.And I appreciate you for that.Thank you. Councilor Fernandez Anderson.

Alameda Strong Community Relief Campaign as follows 60% to small businesses, 20% to nonprofit organizations, and 20% to Alameda renters.All right. And who's presenting on that, Mr. Burton? No.Yeah.Oh, did I miss Potter? Hi. Here you are. Um. Uh, can't hear you. Yeah, it's.It's, um.How did you do it before? Did you style it? It just. This is Louis Butler. I'm here to see Ty Keller, Community Development, Economic Development Division. I am prepared to give a brief staff report if you'd like, or I can answer questions.I know it's getting late. Yeah. Counsel, um, do you. Do you know my brother? Just for the sake of the public? If you could go quickly. Operative word being quickly over a staff report, they'd be lovely. All right, so on April 21st, the city council approved a $600,000 COVID small business relief program.At that same meeting, the city council was concerned that the demand and the need would far outstrip the strength of council directed staff to create a public private partnership, to solicit tax exempt donations to supplement the Small Business Relief Grant Program.At its May 19th meeting, the City Council approved the creation of a Alameda Strong Community Fund to provide emergency grants.To.Small businesses, nonprofit organizations and residential renters economically impacted by the COVID pandemic. Through the website that has been created for me. The strong people can and companies can donate to the three funds previously mentioned, or they can donate to a one fund that will be dispersed as the fund wide fund and staff is recommending that the CityCouncil approves the.Distribution.Of the fund at 60% to small businesses, 20% to nonprofit organizations, and 20% to eliminate it renters.Alternatively.The City Council could authorize the city manager to.Disburse.The general contributions using a different formula to disperse the zero contributions in the same rate so that the funds are received in the individual funds or.Directed staff to return to City Council to.Determine the allocation of the funds once a.Threshold funding level has been.Achieved. That's my report. Thank you, Ms.. Butler and Ms.. Potter, are you still struggling there? So are you. I'm sorry. Oh, I know. I'm in there. You are. But all I wanted to do is hand it off to Lois, so it's perfect.He just gave a nice overview of the council. So we're here to answer any questions. All right, I appreciate that. Um, and I would just like to say, I'll just lead off really quickly and say that I think this is a wonderful idea.The Alameda Strong Fund, I think it's been a little bit of just it's been impacted by so many other things going on right now in our city. Just, you know, on a greater national level, we're we're dealing with a lot of crises, but this fund will be here.And so when hopefully things settle down a little bit, the need is not going away. Our small businesses, our ranchers, we are doing things to help our ranchers. But, um, the longer the shelter in place goes on, the, the more help people are going to need, which is, again, so important to wear your mask in public.Um, we, we can, we can really reduce the spread and help get businesses back to, back to work. But anyway, this is, this is what's in the fund right now. And we are asked to vote on, you know, approving the recommended allocations.And Madam, quick, I forgot to ask, do we have you you said there were some public comments.We had on this.One. Did you.Two.People who submitted comment. But we think they might be on the zoom and raising their hand and wanting to speak directly.Adam Kirk, are you muted?Oh, I'm speaking into the mic.This city manager has his hand up. I do believe that we have two submitted public comments will double back on that. So I Mr. Leavitt.I'm just going to clarify the city council that there's four funds within this relief fund. One is as as Lois has said once, one is for small businesses relief fund, one is for renters assistance and one is for not for profits.And then what we're talking about is the allocation. If someone does it to the general fund at this time, we have very little money in the general fund. Most money donated has been specifically to one of those three specific 500.Okay. Thank you. Okay. Um, and do we know the total amount that's been donated thus far?Yeah, um, the last estimate I have and I, I can go ahead and I just got it tonight. The last time I had was and I'm just giving you round numbers about 30,000 and the business relief, the it's about two or about 6000 for renters assistance and about 2000 for not for profit.And it's less than a thousand that I received that I received in the report for the general the general allocation.Okay. Thank you. Okay. And Madam Quirk, did we get you back to hear the public comments?Hopefully you can hear me now, can you? You can't hear me muted. No, I'm not muted.I am.Speaking into the mic.Loudly.That mis texture really quickly. Cause if we have public comment we should hear them.I stop working?Um.Okay, we're switching mikes because maybe my mic went out. Can you hear me now?You still can't hear me now. Okay.Counsel, does anyone have any questions or comments? Oh, boy. Um. I am calling the city clerk. Maybe I better call her. Now the mayor, councilmember and councilmember Jay Thug. Councilmember, they said, are you muted?Sorry. Yes. Can you hear me now?I can.Okay. When people make contributions to the East Bay Community Fund as the I guess the fiduciary agent of this, are they being given some kind of sheet or something slip that allows us to be some kind of tax deduction?Yes, definitely. The funds are tax deductible and they are giving an electronic supply like that. I think that says how much they have donated. I think letters. Can you give me that?Okay, great. Thank you. Appreciate that.Natalie, can you. Oh. Oh, yes. Can you do that? Okay. Okay. We are trying something creative. The city clerk is having trouble getting her connection. She's going to try to read the letters through my microphone. Let's give it a shot.We have got clothing. Oh, hi. Okay. Can you hear? Councilmember, give me a thumbs up if you can hear. Okay. Go ahead, Mr. Bowling.Okay. Let's see if it works. Uh, yeah. I just wanted to say quickly that I think it's a really good program. I think one of the things that I would ask is I don't think there's been a lot of like marketing around this funding specifically.I think I don't think many people know about it. I think I can probably help with that a little bit, um, through my channel. But I think, uh, the $30,000 is really, I think we can do a lot better than that, especially with, with, we saw the community come out outpouring for a member of our community thathad his car vandalized and within one day had $10,000. So I think there are there is funds in our community. I think if we just get the word out about it. And I think on the this if you look on the Web page for the city, the general city funds the way the buttons are set up onthe Web page, it's different. So I think people are having a hard time finding that. But outside of that, I think I think this is a great thing for our community. And I just wanted to, to, to to make that comment and yeah.Thank you for for the comment staff. I will just say note that name. Okay. Um, let's see. So we are, we, let's see if I can call back. So I think we have one more or if it's a live speaker.Is that what. I don't know. It's just at the bottom of the screen is. Uh, Mr. Potter, is that you? Is that your number? Oh, uh, well, okay. Let me try. Um, Madam Clerk, I know you can't communicate.I'm going to call you on your cell phone again. And if you've got a letter to read, hold my phone up to your microphone. Uh. Uh, uh. Better yet, um. The clerk has emailed the letter to Assistant City Manager Bowden, who has disappeared.It is on mute. Um, there you are. Did you get the email Abbott kept on me? There you go. Though he looks like a well-oiled machine.It. I just have to find it. So let me let me just grab it here for my inbox.So severe the top. I'm just.Sure. Here we go. Here we go. Ben Kaleka. All right. All right. So at the meeting of Waba Darbar GABA and the Chamber of Commerce and City of Alameda on May six, the issue was brought up about not preventing sole proprietors to count as employees and the criteria for qualification for the next series of grants.This was widely considered as a significant oversight in the first set of grants, and we had been informed that we would have a chance to address this in the next round. The group universally agreed that this restriction should be removed from the grant from the next grant, particularly when it came to brick and mortar retail shops.The recommendation was quotations. The applicant must be a small business or nonprofit with up to 25 employee employees, end quote, which removed the doesn't count as one problem. However, that was done instead. What was done instead was to take sole proprietors of restaurants and put them in the You Are Fine group, but put the retailers into agroup that would at least be qualified but for half the amount everyone else could get. Why is this important? Many of the businesses that are that are an important part of what makes Alameda unique and attractive are these kinds of businesses.They include little jams like the sewing room and yes, 20 games. We serve hundreds of kids and adults in Alameda, giving them a place to learn kindness and mutual respect. And we have we have between three and five part timers on staff, usually having their first jobs in high school, giving businesses like ours a chance to survivethrough. This is exactly why the city why the city has done these grants. We are we are most we are some of the most valuable. It is, however. Good, good. The intention was the first the first time around.The distinction between a sole source, proprietor and employee is a matter of accounting. Choosing to take a draw is often what sole proprietor does so they can make sure that the business has what it needs to survive before they take out anything for themselves.Frequently they will have a couple of part time employees, but they tend to work far more than full time themselves to keep the business around to serve. Alameda The state has made changes to the unemployment criteria to acknowledge the illness of work that we sole proprietors do.A couple of years ago, an issue with a landlord put put us in a situation where we could have closed our doors. There was such an outpouring from the community that I knew I could not take away something that meant meant that much to them.I could I could make more money doing something else. But I choose to work my heart out for the community that has cared so much for me to be told now that all the work I do only counts as half a business is dismissive and dismaying.This is a simple, unnecessary issue. Please repair it this time around. That concludes that. Next we have Ronald Mooney, Honorable Mayor and City Council. I hope you will clarify the issue of sole proprietor business applying for funds from the Alameda Strong campaign.I believe a brick and mortar store proprietor or one that works out of commercial unit for clarity should be eligible for a full grant even if they have no employees. I certainly would agree a sole proprietor working out of a residential property should be eligible for the reduced 50% amount.And that concludes the public comments.All right. Thank you. Thank you for your assistance, Mr. Bowden. Okay. And so we finished public comment, and I think you saw the vice mayor stand up, did I not?Yes, yes. Yeah. Thank you. I think they have the assistant city manager. I'm not sure who to ask this question, but actually both those letters that the last one, what was described there, I thought was what we did.I thought we made it clear that there would be a half you could get half the money if you were a sole proprietor working out of your own house because you didn't have the same rent. But the sole proprietors who had brick and mortar stores, regardless of whether they were commercial or whatever else, would be eligible forthe first. That's not the case. I guess I'm a little surprised.By the reaction. Yeah, that is the action that the council took in May and that is the way we interpreted the direction and that is how the program funds will be disbursed.Great. So for Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Mooney can feel confident that what they were concerned about is not five, seven, eight, 916 is a part of the current program.Has been right. Mr. Mooney's characterization is absolutely accurate. Sole proprietors of bricks and mortar businesses will be eligible for. A full 7500 sole proprietors that work out a home based business will be eligible for one half of the amount.Thank you.All right. Just to clarify, because we set up a meeting, we were interpreting that as 50%. So now we've gotten the clarification. It will be what what Mr. Potter just mentioned. All right. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Butler. Thank you, Mr. Potter.Any further questions from staff? Okay. Have it in motion. Mr. Counselor Rody has had it.Thank you, Madam Mayor. And thanks. In this butler, Ms.. Potter, for your presentations, I would move to give the city manager authority to disburse the general contributions 60% to small business, 20 to nonprofit, and 20% to either renters.So we had a motion. Vice mayor has his hand up. We have a motion. It's been seconded. Any discussion thing then maybe we have a roll call vote, please.Councilmember de.SAG.Hi.Yay! I'm back.Madam Clerk, are you going to be able to? You know what? I'm sorry she called in. Okay. I kept seven white guy. He's right by that last time. As we are back. Hi, Carrie. Sci, five eyes.

The structure has been unanimously recommended by both the King County Regional Policy Committee and this committee. Of the whole ordinance, 18139 created a leadership group that is charged with finalizing the recommendations that will be included in the Strategic Plan Process Report.This report will be submitted to the Regional Policy Committee, the County Council and the County Executive by May 31st of this year. The leadership group is made up of three county council members, various city council members, elected public safety officials and several peace up representatives.A table on page eight will outline the membership for you ordinance 18139 also identified as the three King County Council members, the chairs of the Budget and Fiscal Committee, Law and Justice Committee and the Council Vice Chair of Regional Coordination in support of this ordinance, the County adopted on December 14th Motion 1448, which officially appointed these membersto the leadership group. This brings me to the ordinance before you today. As the chair mentioned, this ordinance would add the. Vice chairs of the aforementioned groups to the list of individuals who can be appointed to the leadership group.The voting structure of the leadership group would not otherwise change if the County Council chooses to pass this ordinance. It may need to make a change to the motion that makes the appointments the Council introduced yesterday.

Members of the City Council.Back in April, the City Council asked for a.Short term moratorium.For us to look at the process, for.Us to issue conditional use permit exemptions for very specific uses that allowed alcohol sales. Those uses were essentially restaurants with alcohol, beverage service with meals, florists with accessory sale of alcohol, existing legal nonconforming uses in certain grocery stores if they were of a certain size.Since that time, we have done some research on what other cities have have in place for their issuance of conditional use permit exemptions and are suggesting that we come back to you tonight with a one change that would not allow us to provide any more exemptions for grocery stores of 20,000 square feet or more.That category seemed to provide the most room for interpretation, since there are a number of other retailers out there that may not be classically defined as a grocery store, but do carry grocery and HomeGoods components. So with that, we are suggesting that we still have the ability to continue to to issue conditional use permit exemptions for restaurantwith alcohol beverage service related to meals that we would still issue them for florists that we would still issue them for legal nonconforming uses that may be in place, but that we not allow grocery stores to receive these exemptions.I can give you any more details.

I believe we gave them three months to get it done.

May we have.The staff report?Good evening, Teresa Lucero with community planning and development. I can get this open. We can get started. So this is an official map amendment. It is a rezoning of 46, 50 and 46, 98 Central Park Boulevard. The request is to go for a master planned industrial mixed use eight storeys to campus hospital.The property is located in City Council District eight in the Stapleton neighborhood, and this just gives you an overview of the area. The request is for about four acres, 183,000 square feet. Currently vacant property. Again, the request is to rezone from master plan context industrial mixed use a stories to campus hospital to redevelop the property for arehabilitation center. So subject zoning again industrial mixed use eight storey surrounding properties industrial mixed use eight stories to the east and west north is industrial mixed use five stories and then 12 stories to the south. Industrial mixed use.Again, subject property is vacant to the east and north is also vacant. South is an office building and west is a hotel or commercial use. This gives you an idea of these surrounding properties a lot of vacant properties, a hotel and an office.The campus is own district. One thing I forgot to say earlier is that the proposal is because the hospital use is not allowed in other zoned districts except the campus hospitals own district. That's part of why this is a requested rezoning.But the campus context is for those institutional uses medical, educational, entertainment, large, usually large sites. But again, that medical use is only allowed in c mph. There is a it would be a general primary building form and this is just intended to promote maintenance and concentration of health care facilities.So the process, initial information I notice went out in August of last year. Planning Board was duly posted in at their hearing on December 5th, unanimously voted to recommend approval of this application. Ludie heard this item on December 18th of last year and of course you're here tonight and this hearing has been noticed as well.So there are several are in OWS. We have had no comment from an R.A. or general public on this application. So, you know, the criteria, the plans that apply are current plan 2000, Blueprint 2002 and the Stapleton Development Plan of 1995.Current plan as detailed in your staff report. Staff believes that this application conforms with environmental sustainability strategies, land use strategies, legacy strategies and some of the neighborhood strategies talking about the location of facilities, particularly medical facilities in our neighborhoods.So Blueprint Denver This isn't within an area of change and this is where, of course we want to channel growth. And it is a blueprint land use concept of employment where we want these types of uses and very few residential uses and some of our institutional uses and commercial uses to go into these areas.The Stapleton Development Plan of 1995 calls for this area. It's in districts six and seven in the Stapleton Land Use Plan and calls for this area to be residential and employment and oriented to 49th 47th Avenues near I-70 and should be where there's business, retail and services for the northern portion of the Stapleton area and close, ofcourse, to the transportation calls for improvements of the major highways in the area and of course, to the Stapleton way of developing integrating parks and drainage and natural areas into the community. And then there should be, of course, special sites for institutional and corporate uses according to the plan.So staff believes that the criteria is met, that this is consistent with the adopted plans, with the standard zone district, the campus zone district that we are implementing, the Stapleton Development Plan, as well as as we're developing this complete community in Stapleton.And the justifying circumstances are changed conditions as our former airport redeveloped. And then of course, the consistency with the intent of providing a place for these institutional uses in our campuses and promoting the maintenance and concentration of our health care facilities.There is also a Stapleton GDP. This site is within an area called office. However, there is text that you may find by text within the GDP. Speaking specifically to Central Park Boulevard, saying a variety of land uses are appropriate for the Central Park Boulevard Corridor.Institutional employment and commercial uses are especially encouraged along this corridor south of 49th Avenue, as they will easily be accessible to transit services and Central Park Boulevard. With that, staff recommends approval of this application.Thank you very much. We have five individuals signed up to speak this evening. I would ask that if you're signed up to speak this evening, that you come up to the front bench. When I call your name, your time will start.I want to make sure that you get all of your time at the microphone. First up is Jeffrey Jones.My name is Jeffrey Jones. I live at nine Bretton Woods, Dallas, Texas. I'm here to answer any of your questions regarding this project or the rezoning.Thank you very much. Next up, Mariana Thompson.Console people. I did not see anything there that said subsidized housing or attainable housing. So, you know, until that comes on the table. No. Thank you.Thank you. Next up, Jerry Burton.Well, I'm always happy for progress. But the number one thing. Yes, you're building more apartments. But I must ask you this question. Who are you building them for? The point is, we need to be building more apartment for the bottom, bottom third of our society.0 to 30% is what we need. And I would really love to see either one of these places to be designed for that. You know, we all got to get along here. We all we got number one country.It's not like I get up and move and go stay on the moon, which I probably could do if I if I really wanted to get away from the heartless people. But we've got to look out for each other.We got one. We got one world. We got to share it. We got to be together in all of this, you know? And right now, we you know, we are all in crisis. I'm for it. We are all in crisis for there.But we need to be thinking about the bottom one third of society, the one that is on fixed income right now, the one that working a minimum wage job or someone like me that is homeless, that I will be sleeping outside again tonight in protest, as always.But we got we got to be all inclusive. We can be about the top two third of society. It take all of us to be one society, and that includes one third. Thank you.Thank you. Next up, Jesse Paris.Jesse Pearce. Represent for Denver homicidal Black Star Action Movement for self-defense and positive, active commitment for social change. And I'm also an at large candidate for 2019. I am against this based off the grounds that we have a crisis in this town.And to say that you are prioritizing health camp is opposed to an encampment, tiny home village sites, actual affordable, attainable housing site. It's just very misfortunate to see and hear that this takes precedence over all of that. So, yeah, we're definitely against this.The city really needs to get its priorities straight on who it actually wants to help and service and actually live in this town. Thank you.Thank you. Next up, Chairman Sekou.Yes, Chairman Seiko. Founder Black's lyrics and movement self-defense and the next mayor of the city county of Denver. It. Appears. On the surface that. This is something that is needed for this community in order to consolidate and find a place central where the residents can get the health care that they need in an area where they don'thave to go helter skelter and all over the place to get services. And that's a good thing. That's a good thing. And yet. What concerns me. This as we continually eat up the land resources in this town. At what point are we going to run out of land so that you can't do the things you need todo for the increasing population that's coming? It's a. And what this really represents. Growing up in this town, you have two different communities having to write their own food back in their stable to know it. That Stapleton area was primarily developed for white settlers coming into the neighborhood during gentrification.And when you look at how the services were provided west. Of Central Park. You see dilapidated buildings. Eminent domain. One, two, three, ABC. And yet it becomes more dire about when you see the plan that as you remove one population ethnic group and bring in another.All of a sudden, this is a booming area. But when you had those existing folks who had been here for years, it wasn't considered worthy of the attention of the city for development, to have them have anything. And a good example of the just shopping center stable.You don't have one not one business in that whole thing that's black owned or leased. Imagine that. Yet. Right across the street is Woodlawn Black Community. This is done by a black man. Yeah. Now. So listen. I know you guys are going to go for this.Because the criteria is consistent. The orientation of city council is to remain in the lap of the mayor. So the no one's consequence and then I know you guys are going to do that. They call you vote for my job of yours.Would I agree with it or not?I'm sorry, but your time is up. Thank you. That concludes our speakers. Are there any questions from members of Council on this item? Councilman Espinosa.Now, one quick question. I think it's for CPD. Is the is this is development on this side of Central Park subject to Stapleton Design Review? Yes.Yes.Thank you.All right. Any other questions on this item?Councilman hundred. Yes. Mr. Perez, just one question and quick question for the applicant. If you could briefly describe where we're focusing on the criteria before us. But since there are no other speakers, just want to ask one question for my colleagues questions of my better understanding from my colleagues what the use will be for this site shouldthe rezoning go through.This is an acute care rehabilitation hospital, so it's after you go to an acute care hospital. Any of them in in the entire city, when they're when they're ready to leave the hospital, but they're not ready to go home.And the average stay in our hospital is around 13 or 14 days. Some people are there for 30 days. This is not a drug rehab. It's a physical rehab speech and occupational rehabilitation hospital.Perfect. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Herndon, Councilman Espinosa.I'm just curious for the applicant. Based on what you just said, described as the use. We have done a really you know, from the get go, Stapleton has been designed with affordable housing as a crucial component. I've developed some of the affordable housing in the neighborhood and it reaches some fairly low income levels as well as veterans. How do you guys have any programs to administer to households with low income, low incomes or no insurance approximate?Well, I would say about 90% of our patients are 65 or 70 and older, up to 100 years old. So Medicare is taking care of about 70 or 80% of of the cost of this service. So in commercial insurance takes care of the balance.Are any of your programs subject to Medicaid insurances?No. No. This is not a classification. This is not a skilled nursing or nursing home. We we usually have one or two patients during a month where we're bringing them in. They may not qualify for one of those, but we bring them in as an accommodation.But it's under strict Medicare guidelines.I think we I think we may have done this near 29th, but that was so long ago. Do you know in your analysis of the market, is there maybe not a need today, but will there be a need for that level of care?I mean, care at that level to retain a complete community out there.We think there's a need today. The the closest rehabilitation hospital in that part of Denver is one in Aurora that's approximately 40 years old. One of the neighborhood association members actually told me that she had to go to a rehabilitation hospital in the last year or two.And the only hospital she could get into was near Porter Hospital, and she lives in Montebello, which is probably for her family. She said it was quite a burden even driving down there. But there's there's really not a hospital rehabilitation hospital near there other than maybe downtown.In Aurora.And just for again, for our information going forward. Is there benefit for you? Got any are you better off having sort of your zone lot being sort of an island or are you better off if there are some companion medical uses in the vicinity?Well, we have we are zoning the entire block for medical campus so we can accommodate one or two other uses on that block in addition to our hospital.Right.

The staff report provides details on the proposed rezoning and its compliance with various plans and criteria. Five individuals signed up to speak during the public hearing, expressing concerns about the lack of affordable housing and the prioritization of health care over other needs. Council members asked questions about the proposed use of the property and its potential impact on the community. The council ultimately approved the bill, citing its compliance with the relevant criteria and the need for a rehabilitation hospital in the area.Therefore, the summary of the meeting transcripts is:\nA bill for an ordinance changing the zoning classification for 4650 & 4698 Central Park Boulevard, Stapleton.\r\nApproves an official map amendment to rezone property from M-IMX-8 to CMP-H (master planned, 8-stories, to campus, healthcare), located at 4650 and 4698 Central Park Boulevard in Council District 8.

I wanted to convey my appreciation for the city's efforts to move our successor agency process forward.

Please vote.I, i.Those opposed vote no. Okay. The amendment is adopted. Go ahead, Councilwoman Mosquito.Thank you, Mr. President. As we discussed over the last two weeks, there's been a number of individuals that we've heard from that have come forward and really have brought up some legitimate concerns, questions, and asked us to consider the process that we're using at the city council level for considering potential nominations, thanks to council members who wantfor hosting a number of meetings where individuals have the chance to come forward and raise questions about process. It really underscored for a number of us on council the desire to make sure that moving forward there was a clear and robust understanding of what the council's expectations are when it comes to new nominees for leading our incredibledepartments. I want to reiterate what I've said over the last few weeks, that this is not a substitute or does not specifically pertain to the conversation regarding each of HST or Human Services Department. In fact, it is about a larger conversation, a desire to make sure that we have a clear and transparent process, that we clearly setout our understanding of what Council will consider and would desires to consider in evaluating nominees from the Executive for future department heads. The resolution in front of you formalizes a process and formalizes conversations that many council members in the executive expects when putting forward nominations.And it also concretize some of the desires that we've heard from Silence Breakers, from members of the labor unions who've been involved in conversations about how they want to have a seat at the table for new director discussions and includes ideas and feedback that we heard from members of the change team and other employees.As we evolve and our country evolves, we begin to understand best practices a little bit better. Traditionally, as we all know, having worked on the front line, managers are hired and they're put into place and employees are expected to serve those managers.But today, I think we're leading by example. We're showing that our best practice should include all parties at the table. It should include making sure that the manager and the selection process is inclusive of individuals who have a direct impact on the lives of individuals they serve and who they work with.The selection, confirmation and reconfirmation process that's outlined in this resolution affords the City Council and the public an opportunity to hear directly from the executive and the mayors in the future. Goals and visions for department heads as well as the desired qualifications, experiences, accomplishment, leadership concerns or other qualities that the department head needs to sort of outlinefor us, or that process should outline for us as the Council considers these nominations. The resolution before us helps Council better understand the process that the mayor will use and the engagement sessions that will be held. And really specifically asked whether the racial equity toolkit and racial equity analysis was used and who had a seat at thetable. I'm really excited that this has been drafted together. Again, I, you know, understand that our conversations are separate, but I think that the conversation that we have had in the past few months has really underscored the desire for a more transparent, inclusive and actually just a greater understanding of the background and the inclusion of folks atthe table. So I'm excited that you see in front of you a few changes that came directly from council members and our community. If I may, Mr. President, I just want to read through for small changes.Please do council members get.In section one? A You will see. The amendment clarifies that this resolution outlines the council's expectations and sets forth a more collaborative process from the onset. Thank you, Council Member Herbold, for your work on that Section two a highlights that we are desiring an assessment of the nominee's commitment to racial equity, as we all continue to underscorethat the racial equity toolkit and our commitment to that is more than just words on a piece of paper. We want this to be a living document that we continue to see reiterated in every decision that the Council makes in Section three, and we add in a review of employee complaints resolved in the employee's favor.This is something that we really wanted to see highlighted from the Silence Breakers themselves, who said that we'd love to see if there was any concerns in the past, but also we wanted to include if any corrective action has been taken and the nominee has participated in various trainings.That would also be important. As we know, correction and corrective behavior is critical as well. In section five, we include sorry, excuse me. In Section five, we exclude the appointments and confirmations from a handful of departments. For example, Seattle Police Department, noting that we already have some processes and procedures in place that are outlined in statute, andwe have a certain procedure around those appointments that this resolution. Should not supersede. Thank you, Councilmember Gonzales, for raising that. So as you can tell, this resolution has been incredibly collaboratively drafted and right up to the last minute by including additional amendments.Thanks to all of you for your diligent work to get us amendments early. I know that we tried to include as many as possible. I want to thank Amelia for your work in helping to make sure that we had this on time.And Jeff Sims and my staff say for their work to get all the amendments in place are looking forward to concurrence on this.Thank you, Mayor. Thank you. Senator Mosquito. Any other.Quick.To your point, Councilmember Bagshaw.Thank you. And Councilman Mosquito, thank you for listening to everybody on this. I know you've picked up many of our recommendations and also work closely with the mayor's office. And I also acknowledged to the mayor that she wants to be able to do her work under the charter.We do our work. We got a lot to do here. But you set the tone saying what it is we're looking for. And I want to acknowledge that you have not at any point been in a position where you're telling the mayor what to do, but you're indicating that this is what we're looking at.We want to make sure that as somebody is selected, that we have an opportunity to get this information in advance. And your focus on racial equity is terrific. So thank you for all your work.Very good. Any other comments before we take take the boat customers to watch.Thank you, President Harrell. I support this resolution which states expectations for an inclusive candidate surge for City of Seattle department directors in the future. It is obviously a response, as Councilmember Skinner said, to the shameful disregard the mayor showed Human Services employees and impacted communities, including vulnerable homeless community members themselves.When she nominated Jason Johnson to be the permanent director of the Human Services Department and then continued to systematically ignore the overwhelming voices that we were hearing. As a as has been acknowledged as resolution. This resolution is not about the current issue of the Human Services Director appointment and will do nothing to address that issue.And that's why it is important to point out that while this resolution is correct in many respects, it's about next time. And it does not provide an excuse for elected officials failing to represent their constituents this time. In the case of the current Human Services Director appointment, which has been quite controversial, this resolution makes many requests thatI fully agree with about how the mayor should make appointments in the future. But I the question that comes to mind is, does the mayor really need the council to recommend she talk to impacted communities before choosing an important department head?And that just seems obtuse on her part. If that is indeed the case, and what will council members do in the future if the mayor does not take into account the opinions of the impact communities? Because at this moment the opinion, the views of the impacted communities are not being taken into account.So by passing this resolution, will council members do it in the future? And if they were going to do it in the future, then why don't they do it now? I mean, I have this entire logical conundrum in my brain that if council members are going to vote for this resolution for the future, then why wouldn't theydo it at this moment? You know, I really think that this the community members should watch for this hypocrisy from council members who would all vote yes on this resolution about the future. And at the same time, prove that they have no interest in actually following it because they are disregarding all of its principles when it becomesa concrete question, such as the Human Services Director appointment, and I should congratulate Council O'Brian and Mosquito for voting with me on the resolution that I brought forward, which said that the mayor should take this nomination back, which has been opposed by a significant proportion of the community and should really go through a search that will includerace and social justice questions and include the impacted communities. So vote yes on this resolution. But ordinary people and city of Seattle employees who are watching this and who will be watching this later this week will have to speak up as courageously as the Human Services workers have spoken up in order to make sure that these resolutionsare not simply in the abstract world, but are followed through by elected officials.Any of the comments on the resolution before we take a vote. Okay. So those in favor of adopting resolution 31868 as amended, please vote i. I those opposed vote no. The resolutions adopted in Charles Simon. Please read the next agenda item.For adoption of other resolutions. Agenda Item 13 Resolution 318 71 endorsing the final report and recommendations of the Regional Affordable Housing Task Force.Councilmember Johnson.Final one, colleagues. This resolution endorses about 18 months with the work that I was your designee for. The Regional Affordable Housing Task Force has some incredible statistics and incredible opportunities in there for us to contemplate room for improvement.But given that we're now on our three, I won't belabor you with those statistics and just ask you to take a read through. I will say it does set an ambitious goal of building 244,000 net new units of affordable housing by 2040, with the requisite share goal of 8800 units a year over the next five years.In order to meet our fair share of that goal, I believe that our action earlier today with mandatory housing affordability is one of the critical ways that we would continue to meet our fair share of that 8800 units per year goal.Similar resolutions are going to be adopted by the County and Sound Cities Association. What started as a sort of small but small idea to implement affordable housing targets in our comprehensive plans morphed into something bigger, bolder and better.So I encourage your support for Resolution 31871.Thank you, Catherine. Just and any comments or questions that I'll move this Catherine Mosquito.Thank you. I'm really proud to co-sponsor this with Councilmember Johnson. This resolution looks forward to future collaboration with our regional partners. We know that it's timely as well, given our conversations today on MHC. We applaud the incredible work it took to get to this point.But the boundaries of the city do not define the housing crisis in this region. And as we look for additional solutions and hopefully additional revenue as well as well, I'm looking forward to outlining what our local partners can do through the Regional Affordable Housing Task Force recommendations to make sure that other cities around this region pursue policychanges that achieve greater impacts by doing so in harmony with the city of Seattle. We are taking some important steps today, but in order for us to truly address this regional housing crisis, we needed a collab. We need a collaborative approach, collaborative approach to work on the solutions that can create the housing, the density and the affordabilityto truly create an inclusive region. Obviously, this is relying on not just funding from the state and federal partners, which at the federal level will most likely continue to not materialize. But we also need to look at smart land use, zoning and housing policies as were outlined in our legislative agenda to ensure local cities are working towardsthe same solution. So excited to co-sponsor this and look forward to future collaboration in our region.Thank you. Councilmember Macheda, any other comments before we take a vote? Really good. Okay.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThank you. Item 14, please.Communication from Councilwoman Pryce, Councilwoman and Councilwoman Allen, Council member, super long recommendation to direct city manager to report back within 90 days.With a report.Between various models for the operation of the helicopter unit of the Long Beach Police Department.Thank you, Councilwoman Price.You, Mr. Mayor. So this item really is a follow up to some of the budget discussions and decisions that we made regarding our police helicopter unit. I'm a huge, huge supporter of the helicopter operations because I'm very familiar with and I think many of us are.The reality that when people commit crimes, one of the first instincts is to flee. And either whether they're fleeing on foot or in a car, that flight can be very dangerous and difficult for our police officers to apprehend the fleeing suspect if they're on foot.It's very difficult to be able to locate their whereabouts from the ground. And if they're in a vehicle, it can be really dangerous because oftentimes it results in high speed chases. And so the helicopter, a police officer, is trained to be able to see things from a much broader viewpoint and vantage point.And their operations are just much more efficient and safe in terms of apprehending fleeing suspects. And so I'm a little bit concerned because when we adopted the changes to the budget regarding our helicopter unit, we didn't really have a structure in place.I know we delayed the implementation of moving things like the Hart team over without further study and evaluation of what the practical changes would be. But with the helicopter unit, we simply just approved the budget modifications with the understanding that we'd be notified later of the operational changes.So we have been given some more information of how the operational model might work with the new budget. But I'm asking the city manager to take another look at that because with the increase in violent crime that we're seeing throughout the city.What I don't want to happen is for us to lose any more patrol officers from any of the four divisions. If a patrol officer who's trained to know what to look for has to go and assist a civilian pilot with with basic law enforcement functions, then I think it will cause our patrol divisions to suffer with thatloss of a body. So it may make sense to do it. It may not make sense to do it. I know circumstances have changed since we adopted the budget in terms of staffing for that unit. And I'm just asking the city manager to take another look to for us to determine, does this new model still make sense? Is the cost benefit enough that it it outweighs the benefits of having trained law enforcement personnel in a helicopter? And and if so, of course, I'm going to support whatever decision the chief and the city manager believe is the right thing to do.But I think this warrants a second look now that we've had an opportunity to to kind of settle from the budget and evaluate what some of the impacts of our decisions might be in a practical sense. So I want to thank the city manager for taking a look at this, and I want to urge my colleagues tosupport this item. And I just want to remind everyone, we're not asking to move any money around right now. We're just asking to see the current budget recommendations make sense in light of some of the practical realities. Thank you.Thank you, councilwoman. Next up is and I'm assuming that's also in motion. Councilman Van De has it received?Thank you, Mayor. I just want to thank profoundly Councilwoman Price and our amazing city staff for this item today. I'm really looking forward to that discussion when it comes back. And I think it's absolutely important that we understand the impact of our budgetary decisions on the work our city is able to do for our residents, especially comingfrom a district where there are so many violent crimes that happen. So I'm looking forward to that discussion. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman.Thank you. I hope that when this report comes back that we're able to hear a little bit more about the standards across the industry. There are agencies across this country that take police officers and pay for them to go through a pilot school just so that they can get trained police officers.The amount of value that a pilot and spotter team happen when they coordinate and know each other well and work together well and have similar training experience. They say that it's worth between nine and 15 cars on the ground.And so the the cost benefit seems to be one that we really need to look at. So I'm very supportive of this item. I was supportive of reevaluating this as a potential cut when the budget was here. And I'm glad that it's coming back for an additional look.Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce.Thank you. Now I have Councilwoman Allen.Yes. Thank you, Mayor. I also want to thank Councilwoman Price for bringing this item. I, too, am a huge advocate of the helicopter. And as a former police officer, I can definitely attest to the benefits of the helicopter and what they bring to law enforcement.It saves on bad manpower and it's a great de-escalation tool when you can set up perimeters and it just slows things down. And so I look forward to seeing their report. I think experience matters. Like my councilwoman, Mongo just spoke on.And I like to see that those benefits. I also would like to know, I mean, if there's been any conversations with even, you know, contracting our services out to any of our border cities. And and then also, I did have some questions with regards to I know that the port has participated in some of the fees forthe helicopters in the past and what that still looks like. So these are all things that I definitely would like to see and when the when the report comes back. So thank you so much again. And I appreciate staff looking into this.Thank you. I don't believe there's any public comment on this.No. There's no public comment on this item.Cast your votes, please.District one. I district to. By District.Three.District four, District five. I.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nmay be incurred, unpaid, unpaid fees, etc., where we are going to be removing that bond requirement. And I just wanted to ask the department if they could step forward and explain that just so that all of the public is very aware of this policy change.Thank you much for that. Thank you very much, Councilwoman, for the question. My name is Stacy Loucks. I'm the director of the Department of Excise and Licenses. And also with us today is our treasurer, Steve Arlington. And we're here to help address any concerns or questions you have about.This particular issue.This change that we're bringing forward to you tonight is a change in how we do licensing and not requiring surety bonds.This change is requested as surety.Bonds have become increasingly difficult, if not impossible to obtain, because surety bond companies are no longer serving their marijuana industry.Because of risk of exposure to federal lawsuits.This recent change in the bond industry is an obstacle for existing marijuana businesses to be able to renew their licenses, much less for new businesses to even be able to obtain the licenses. So in working with the Treasurer, we came up and have discussed our options and came up with the idea of just striking the requirement inthe since 2009 and the six.Years of.Working with marijuana and requiring surety bonds, we've never drawn across the bond and Treasury feels the existing tools they have in place would be adequate to cover any sort of concerns in case people weren't paying their taxes. Thank you, Mr. President.So can I clarify, in the time we've been doing medical and retail marijuana has, have we ever had a situation where someone was, you know, owing the city money and we used a bond? My understanding is no, but if you wouldn't mind a call up, Steve Arlington.Just to provide that technical explanation.Good evening. I'm Steve. Only time the city treasurer. And to answer your question, no. In the six years of medical marijuana and almost two years of retail marijuana, we've never drawn upon a bond to collect any taxes owed by anybody in the industry.Great. Thank you very much. So just allowed to comment really briefly before we vote, which is to say that this to me is a very common sense adaptation to the limits that are at levels of government that go beyond Denver.I really am proud of our high standards that we have for the industry, whether it's, you know, age restrictions, our restrictions, the ways that we approach trying to make this a responsible business in our city are really important.But there are absolutely places where the federal government has authority and we are unable to maybe have the same high standard we might want because of the way that they have limited us. And I think that, you know, you could throw up your arms and, you know, be blind to those things or you could take a verypractical approach and say, you know, do we have the protections in place? So I'm appreciative of us taking a very common sense approach to this and, you know, really acknowledging where we have some limits we continue to push.I know our federal lobbyists that Denver, you know, contributes to the to the to the national conversation, continue to try to encourage our national representatives to do banking reform so that we can have all kinds of protections for the industry and not having to operate in cash, etc..I hope we'll continue those efforts. But in the meantime, I'm appreciative that we're taking a common sense approach. So thank you to the department. Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Ortega.First, I want to thank Councilwoman for calling this out. I do have a couple of questions. So, Steve, can you come forward and explain what those tools are that we do have in place that would ensure that if you know that we've got the right protections in the event that I think these are just for nonpayment.But I know that we recently had some news media coverage about some of the facilities where Denver Police Department caught some of them selling to underage youth. And, you know, that's a different area. But I think the overall protections for the citizens and the city is important.And so I'd like you to address what those tools are in place that provide those protections.Yes. Yes, I can. For the nonpayment of taxes. Currently, the Denver Revised Municipal Code provides that the city can seize and restrain any of the assets utilized by that business so that any of the equipment that they use we can seize it, destroying it, and auction it off for the collection of the back taxes.We can also take a court action against the business to obtain a judgment against them.Okay. I appreciate that. I think that helps clarify for anybody that's listening that although we may not be able to collect on a surety bond because as you indicated, it's very difficult for folks to obtain that we do have those tools in place to be able to ensure that the city is being made whole, if you will, for any of these payments. That might not be me. So thank you.Thank you, Councilman Ortega. And the questions and comments on 68. All right. Since that was not called out, we are moving on and I believe we are ready for the block votes. All other bills for introduction are ordered published.Councilman Espinosa, will you please put the resolutions on the floor for adoption and a block?Thank you, Mr. President.

The Council will now discuss and consider one motion to suspend the council rules before we consider item four on the agenda. The Council rules require that the Council adopt by resolution a monthly rotation for the position of Council President Pro Tem in order of seniority and requesting that this Council rule be suspended to allow consideration ofResolution 31924, which does not delegate the Council President Pro tem rotation in order by seniority. Two thirds of council members must vote in favor of this motion for us to consider Resolution 31924 as proposed. If two thirds are in favor, the Council will then consider Resolution 31924.So I am going to move to suspend council rule one as yeah, one de point one relating to the delegation of a council president pro tem rotation in order by seniority. And I think this has been motion and it's been seconded.Are there any comments? You see no comments from my colleagues. Those in favor of the motion vote i. I. Those opposed vote no. The motion carries in the council rules suspended to allow consideration of the resolutions. So now the Council will consider resolution 31924.Which has not been read into the record. And we lost our clerk. Let me read here. We're going to go ahead and read it into the record first and then we'll we'll move through.A resolution designating the monthly president pro tem of the City Council of the City of Seattle for 2020 through 2021 and superseding Resolution 31884.Thank you, Judy. So we have now read. Agenda item four into the record. So I'm going to move to adopt the resolution, ask for a second and then we'll call for any comments.

And for those of you who weren't quite following what we did on agenda item four, we essentially suspended the rules around around the need to do our council president pro tem schedule by seniority. So we have shifted things a little bit.Again, it's wasn't controversial and it was a agreed upon thing. So I don't want folks to think that this is an affront or an insult somehow to to you councilmembers talent.And in fact, I appreciate.So it means that that Councilmember Herbold will be council president pro tem in January, followed by Councilmember Suarez and then followed by Councilmember Mosqueda. And the only reason I'm highlighting that is because it's particularly relevant for the first three months of this year, which we will get to in a moment.So before I talk about my other business, is there any other further business to come before the council? And for the for the new members. This is if you need to be excused for a full council meeting, this is the opportunity for you to do that.All right.

I am nonetheless taking the opportunity to, in oral form, request that I be excused for all four Council meetings between January 13th and oh, what's the week before March 30th?S.O.S. We have March 30th.What's the Monday before that? March 20, March 23rd. So January 13th and. And March 23rd. I will be and I'm excited to be leaving on maternity leave. I will be the second council member in three months and in the history of the city of Seattle to request maternity leave and am very excited about about the opportunity tostep away from my council obligations to bond with my first child. And I'm looking forward to be to being able to spend some time away from City Hall a little this morning I was having a little bit of FOMO, hearing all of you all talk about the wonderful things that are going to happen in the first quarter. But it is just an absolute humbling experience for me to be able to be in a position to start a family and to be able to have had some of the best prenatal care I could have ever asked for, and to have the support of my former colleagues and my new colleagues in carrying some of the workthrough in the first quarter. In my absence, I really appreciate all of the ongoing support from each of you up on the dais and from my own staff who have been key to making sure that the work will continue in my absence.So we have a solid work plan that we've been working on for weeks in my office to make sure that the roles and responsibilities of the council president office that are part of my office's responsibilities now are going to flow well with each of the three council president pro times that are going to be in place forJanuary, February and March. And we are really looking forward to continuing to advance many of our policy priorities around child and and affordability and transportation issues and early learning and education issues throughout the city. And look forward to establishing all of that foundational work in my absence over the next three months.And then and then hitting the ground running on March 30th when I return to the city council. So really appreciate the again support from all of you as I step away and and focus on on family for for three months this this year undivided attention hopefully to that and really look forward to being able to do that. So if there's no objection to my being excused, I will be excused.That's it. All right.So as a reminder, once again, there is a short reception and that will commence now in the Bertha Knight Landis room, which is on the first floor of City Hall. All are welcome to attend.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nRussian case.Now we're going to move to item 16, please, with the item club.Item 16 is is a communication from Councilwoman Price Council member. So Pinol and Vice Mayor Andrew's recommendation to request city manager to work with police department and multi departmental team to report back on the feasibility of creating teams that are on call to work with city departments.Thank you. Count on price.Thank you. I'm asking my colleagues to support me on this item as our ongoing efforts to try to create an environment where homeless individuals are being offered services and having incentives to allow them to get into services with some provisions regarding their property in the city of Long Beach.As we all know, we're taking huge steps to improve our ability to provide assistance to those in need while also minimizing the impacts homelessness has to the communities. Tonight, I would like to have us look into the possibility of Long Beach taking another step to improve our ability to address homelessness.We have an amazing staff and city team and our homeless outreach team, our police department, our quality of life officers, our fire departments, heat heart teams, and they work tirelessly every day to get homeless people the help they need.We've seen over and over that getting people into services is the most successful way of helping them to make major life changes and long term transformations. Through rehab, shelter or bridge housing or through detox treatment, they can obtain the first steps they need to get on that journey to recovery and or the assistance that they need tomake life time changes. It can be time consuming and difficult work to convince our first responders and our homeless outreach team to finally accept services. And we want to make it easier for individuals experiencing homelessness to be willing to accept those services.One of the hurdles that I have personally observed through many homeless outreach ride alongs is that people living outdoors do not want to park from their belongings. Their belongings can, in most cases not be brought to the treatment center, which forces the individuals to choose between getting help or keeping their property.We should be able to offer another option where we have a dedicated team that can be called to inventory, collect transport and store the property for people, giving them peace of mind that they're not giving up their belongings in order to accept services.Instead that the city is working to help make accepting those services less difficult. This could be done for any part of our multi department team that works to address the issue of homelessness from police to fire to our health department.This could also be used to assist police when conducting arrest or when quality of life officers are transporting someone to a treatment center or facility. It could be used when our Hart team responds to a call and we want to get someone into the help that they need.This could be used when homeless outreach teams meet with an individual for the 17th time and they finally agree that they're going to enter into a program that gets them back on the right track. But they don't want to abandon their property, which is incredibly reasonable.Any department who would want to work to safely itemize and store property would be able to contact a team, a city team for that purpose, making it easier for staff members, working to get someone into services to be able to focus their attention on the individual.Removing this reason for someone to refuse services helps us make it more likely and more attractive for people to get into the services that they need by accepting services on the spot. It also helps free up existing city staff working with homeless individuals to do their work and not be forced to spend long periods of time inventoryingproperty. Further, this inventory team could help us be more proactive in getting public spaces cleaned up by giving individuals experiencing homelessness greater confidence and security that their property will be kept safely in a secure location. It's a major way that we can reduce barriers to accepting services, help our multi department teams be more efficient and effective, andimprove the maintenance of our public spaces. And with the purchasing of the building that will become the navigation center, we have an opportunity here. As a city, we can be more efficient with our specialized staff in ways that help city staff be more effective in police work, public space maintenance, providing homeless rehabilitation services and maintenance of ourparking spaces. I believe this team could this inventory team could really become a huge asset to the city as we continue to work together to better help the homeless and to maintain our public spaces. So I ask my colleagues to approve this item, which allows us to explore the possibility of creating inventory teams to assist our firstresponders.Thank you, Councilwoman Price, Councilmember Supernova.Thank you. Great report, Councilman. I think that this is all about giving support to those who do the outreach and giving them a broader range of resources to help folks. And who knows? With this in place, maybe that average number of 17 visits will come down.Thank you.Thank you, Ms.. Mary Andrews.Yes, thank you, Mayor. Council County Councilwoman Price. I think that this is an excellent idea to be able to help our homeless situation, because a lot of individuals do not want to depart from anything that they have created or stored.So I want to thank you for bringing this item forward. And I think any time that we can encourage homeless individuals to accept service is worth exploring. I am sharing with you all of the photos. If you can get a chance to see those.I have photos of this ongoing encampment along nine corridor in my district. I've gone out and spoke to these individuals. Some want to help. Some do not. But if they can make it easier for them to trace the transition and openness, this mechanism can help them.It's a lot of individuals and I know a few individuals pray to God that you never, ever have to be homeless, that you will be able to understand that a lot of these individuals. They're not really looking for help.But we're going to continue to stay and do everything we can to try to get them any kind of help that they need. So I thank you very much, Mr. Rice, for bringing this item forward, and I will totally support it.I don't see any public comment, any members of the public here on this item here.

If a majority of the ballots received do not support the establishment of the bid, then the bid cannot be established.Ballots may be accepted up to the time that the public hearing is closed, at which time no more ballots will be accepted. And any member of the public may observe the tabulation process according to the guidelines that no cell phones shall be used.No questions shall be directed to supervisory staff. Observers shall not interrupt or speak to the ballot processing staff, and observers shall not approach the ballot the ballot processing staff. So with that staff requests that counsel will receive the reporting documentation into the record, conclude the hearing to consider the establishment of the bid director, city clerk to atablet to tabulate the ballots and report the results of the tabulation to the Mayor and City Council during this meeting. And if a majority of the ballots received are in favor of establishing the bid, adopt a resolution to establish the bid for the initial term of five years effective January 1st, 2016, through December 31st, 2020.And that concludes my report. Okay. Thank you. With that, I'm going to turn this over to those that made the motion. And then remember, this is a two part process. So we're going to have the motion. We're going to take a vote.Mr. City Attorney, is that correct? On the on the hearing motion? Is that right? Mr. City Attorney.Yes. We would come back.We would conclude we take the vote first and then we come back on the second.No, we take the vote after the tabulation of the ballot.Okay. So and we would also do can we do public comment now?We do public comment and any protest now they want to come forward and discuss it for the council and then we adjourn to candidates.Excellent. So let me take let me begin by saying if there's any protests on the hearing from the public. Any comment on it? Saying None. I'm going to allow both Councilmember Andrews and Councilman Superhot to make a few comments.Oh, sir, please. Yes. Come forward. Or if you'd like to go up there, you can do your comment from the top as well either either way. Okay?Yes.Okay.No worries, sir. Just please give us your name for the record and please begin.Mayor Garcia, this is Bruce Palmer Koch Cash Register Company, 1900.East Anaheim Street. I am against the Business Improvement District because I.Don't know how you could.Possibly improve my business. I talked to many people on the last two days. The businessman did not even get a say so in it along Anaheim Street.There are many small Cambodian.Businesses that are just barely.Making it and can't afford to have their rent increased.By this.Operation. It won't help their businesses, but yet we're getting it thrown at us. And the city owns 40% of the property. We need 51% say no.I don't see how we can possibly do that. I feel that the engineering.Of the project where they cut the lines. Was instrumental.In the.Fact that we would not be possible to obtain enough of a vote. The people that I talked to yesterday and today. Do not want this extra taxation type issue that is being thrown upon us. Myself. I'm 73. You want to charge me $5,000 over the next five years?And then I doubt that you would.Discontinue this operation.I imagine you would continue it on for as long as I would live, which may not be that long.Luckily for us.But I would like to have.Some relief in my old age, and I'd like to see everybody here. Think about all the people that came here from Cambodia. And the small businesses they have started. I don't think any one of you has walked this a district and talked to them.And asked them, do you want to pay extra money on your rent? For us to make the city.Clean, safe and beautiful. How are you going to do that? How are you going to guarantee me that you are going to improve my business? $980 a year. Is there any guarantee on that? That's a question for you, Mr. Mayor.Can you answer.That? This is not an opportunity to ask questions, but when you're concluded, I'll make some comments.All right. Well, like I say, after talking to so many of the people. I have noticed that all the blank. Places on this, which is over 60, were not even notified.I have a Filipino friend that.Is in the.A and cherry liquor store.He owns that property. He did not even.Get a ballot. Whoever did this job. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. So I'm going to turn this over to Mr. Andrews to make a few comments. I just want to just before he goes, you want to make sure that we're clear what the what the item is.This is a hearing to count the votes of those business owners in the proposed assessed property improvement district. And so this is obviously this is a democratic process that those that are in the assessed area have votes and they're weighted by size of property and so forth.And so we have, as you all know, a handful of these throughout the city, including in Bixby Knolls, the newest one being in North Long Beach, Belmont Shore downtown, and as well as Fourth Street. And I believe one of our newer ones is also on Anaheim, on east east Anaheim.So let me turn this over to Councilmember Andrews and then we'll begin the process of counting the votes.Thank you, Mayor. You know, first of all, I'd like to say I'm very happy to see that we have come to the point of counting ballots for the midtown bid. For many years, I worked with the Cambodian Town Inc business owners, the community in establishing this bid.As a result, a recent extensive work by stakeholders, city staff, consultants and state required stakeholders have been met and that if this final vote tabulated, conducted this evening indicate a majority support, the Council will ask to vote in favor.But established in Midtown Business Improvement District, I sincerely hope that my colleagues will support this item so that we can move forward with the beautification on nine corridor. The District will provide new improvement and activities, including a clean, safe and beautiful corridor that will encourage new business and development and attract additional business and they service.And I think the most important part about all of this is that people will get a chance to vote and that will make final decision about all of it. Thank you very much.Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.Yes. With staff be able to provide us information on whether or not there are any opportunities for businesses that are having financial challenges to be able to apply for support on their bid fees.Council member Mungo That is not an opportunity. These are assessed through the property tax, through the county and they will be.Collected along with.Property taxes. And there really isn't an opportunity for abatement.So the bid, once it has a board in place, would not be able to refund those or give credits towards the business in any way.That's correct.Okay. Thank you.Vice Mayor Alonso.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I wanted to just show my appreciation to staff and everyone that's been involved in the bid to date when we worked with community members to create Cambodia Town in 2007. It was my hope that a business improvement district would in fact be formed to support the goals and aspirations of business and property ownersalong the corridor. So I wanted to share with everyone that I am extremely supportive, continue to be extremely supportive of this bid, and look forward to seeing this corridor evolve into a destination beyond its current success. Thank you.Thank you. I'm going to close the hearing now. We've done public comment. So what happens now is the clerk's staff will begin the process of tabulating the votes over the course of the meeting. Once the votes come back, if there is an affirmative vote, then the council then records that into the record by having the vote atthat time. Is that correct?That's correct. At that time, the council will then consider the resolution establishing.Okay, great. And so we'll then go ahead and do that. So the clerk will go begin counting the ballots. And I know we're going to be transitioning to minimum wage in just a minute, but I want to get two things out of the way quickly.Consent calendar. Can you get a motion to approve? There's some staff here that we can clear a couple of seats probably. Can I get a motion in a second for consent calendar, please? Madam Quirk. It's a good thing they're putting it up.\nReasoning:Reasoning:",

We did discuss this with the developer representative and unfortunately AB 88 requires that the local public utility purchase the appliances in order for them to qualify for this.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nL is final passage of ordinance approving a lease an option to purchase authorizing the city manager to execute documents necessary to implement the terms of the ten year lease and option to purchase with 651 West Tower Avenue for Building 91 located at 61 West Tower Avenue, Alameda Point.All right. So the staff have a presentation for this?Yes. It's up to you. I'm Jennifer, our chief operating officer. From the point I'm happy to make a presentation or respond to some comments or questions you may have.So I pulled these items because at the last this is for the second read. And at the last council meeting, I had noted that there was not mention in regard to the heading, for instance, that this included a purchase, an option to purchase these buildings, that both of these leases include options to purchase and or not.And and they were both silent in regards to other than the the purchase price. Any substantiation of how that was arrived, whether it meets the how how the city is able to recommend that that whether or not that meets the market value of the properties any.Any discussion as to the purchase price. And when this came back, I greatly appreciate that the heading was modified to add that it's a purchase of the building and these are buildings that are at Alameda Point that are the city's buildings that the city is selling.So the city is essentially now granting the option to sell off its assets. And as such, it does rise to a higher level of scrutiny by all of us and that it requires four votes to pass. And I believe that that it also requires that there be written discussion in the documentation that the public can read andsee for themselves the analysis of arriving at the purchase price that was not included last time when it came back. I was expecting it to be addressed. It's it's there's still no discussion of it in the written documentation.And as such, I cannot support it. I think it's appropriate to have it return and have there be discussion of the purchase price. And I appreciate that sales prices can be can be discussed and negotiated in closed session.However, when it comes to the public, I think it's important to include a discussion about the sales price and not just state what it was. So that being said, if anyone else wants to make any comments to me or make a motion.I move that we approve final passage of both items. I think I have a second.All right, so I just.I. I think that the presentation and the discussion last time highlighted that the fact that these these buildings are in need of great investment. And we've had past discussions about particularly the commercial potential commercial zones of Alameda Point having a term called negative value because of the lack of of infrastructure and and and the need for renovatingand modernizing these buildings. I think the negotiation was fair. And there's also it's an option to buy and there'll be a decision and an opportunity to discuss that and great deal when when that option is about to be exercised.So I think we should move forward on this and seize the opportunity at this time.And, Madam Mayor, for me, yes. I mean, I would just add that when back several years ago, in the last administration, when the the majority of Alameda point was conveyed from the Navy, I remember the saying we had back then is that we wanted to let especially the business community know that Alameda point is open for business. And we want to show people that this is a good place to come, take a risk, because if you've spent any time traveling around Alameda Point, you know, it's in pretty deplorable condition. So the folks who are making these first steps, I would like them to pioneers.It's it's a leap of faith. But I think they're going to make the journey that much easier for those who follow because they'll be able to show people this is what's possible. We started out with something that was in its dilapidated, deteriorating condition, and this is what was done with it.We have a report a little later about an award that was given for our Brownfield Development of Alameda Landing. And this is Alameda Landing and then some just because of the magnitude. So I completely and wholeheartedly second the vice mayor's motion because the longer we leave those buildings out there, the more at risk the city is notonly have increasing costs of maintaining that, but, you know, people can be injured just from those sorts of businesses and hazards really remaining in our in our city. So thank you for that motion, vice mayor.I remember days.Ago. Thank you very much. As I was two weeks ago, when we first reviewed this matter, I am satisfied with the business terms that we're entering into because that's what this is about. This is about starting up a project based upon our direct negotiations with an entity who, with a number of partners, many of whom are locallybased, approached Alameda with an idea of bringing two buildings that are, at this point, in substandard state. And that's an important point because so much of Alameda point is that way, not just the buildings, but the infrastructure underneath the ground.And what that means is when we're redeveloping Alameda Point, it's very different from, say, redeveloping a building over at Harvard I'll or building at Marina Village or in other business parks like Bishop Ranch and San Ramon. You know, those places while certainly marina villages built out that are very you know, those places have land on which, youknow, you can just build and not worry about what's underneath anymore. But that's different in Alameda. So there's there's a certain amount of risk and some might even say incredible risk. But that doesn't mean that city staff or city council members are just going to give away the property.You know, we're going to do our due diligence. We're going to take a look at comparables when it comes to getting value or if or we're going to use other ways to to understand that we're getting the value that that the taxpayers expect of us.One of the another way of valuing land is taking into account the costs that have to go in to improving a certain site, something called a residual land value analysis, blah, blah, blah. So when you look at it on those terms, I think the city staff have exercised due diligence that everyone expects of them to.And the fact that a number of the partners are locally based with exciting products and services, I think this is something that we can all be excited about. But I think one of the points that the Mayor has expressed is something to keep in mind that as we move forward with the this and other real estate transactions, that we, you know, convey that information in an easily digestible manner, you know, what the per square foot sales price, etc.. You know, how does it you know, how did we arrive at the market value, things like that.But I am satisfied that that our staff and the Council has exercised a proper due diligence in terms for this transaction.A member, Odie.Thanks, Ben. Two quick questions, Massoud, if you. So without repeating everything that my three colleagues said. Everything. I agree with everything they said. But if you can. I think my notes were for for building nine. The developer was going to pour $33 Million into renovations and improvements.And for building 91, it was 6 million.Right now it's actually you've got 29 million going into building nine and then 9 million going into building 91.29, nine. Okay, so that's $38 million and then, you know, an additional probably 8 million if. If they actually do the purchase because one is, what, 5.5 and the other.One's three, so $8.5 million, right.So we have someone who's willing to put in, you know, close over $45 million in two buildings that, you know, as my colleague said, were pretty dilapidated and will attract jobs. So I think that's a good thing. One last question, though, on this option to purchase, if they do do an option to purchase, does that come backto the council?No, it does not.Okay.So I appreciate your last question. It does not come back to us that for both of these documents provided merely Building nine has a current option to purchase for $5.5 million. The option can be exercised upon the completion of a subdivision parcel map.Staff is working on the creation of the subdivision maps and will be presenting them to the Planning Board and City Council next year. That's going to be happening momentarily. That does not renegotiate the price the prices declared right here.That's what the council is agreeing to. That's all it says is what the total price is. And for building 91, it's exactly the same language, except it's 5.5 million. What I believe needs to be included here is not just what is decided in the back, behind closed doors, a negotiated price, but something more than that that shareswith the public how this is arrived at to justify that this is in fact a fair market value and long term what the impact is to the city. For instance, on one of these, there's a monthly rent of $18,000.However, when it becomes that the purchase at 3 million, there will be a shift in revenue coming to the city instead of having a monthly revenue stream of, for instance, on that piece of property approximately 20,000 per month, the city will will receive the money, the 3 million, and then they're going to receive a property tax.And there should be my opinion set forth here what the property taxes and a comparison and how we're going to move forward as a city because we have expenses to incur five years down the road, ten years down the road, 20 years down the road.And we are making a choice now to sell off the people's property. And all we are telling them is this one set price. And so as much as there's these questions that go back and forth here, I think it's very important to be put in writing so that the public has the opportunity to review it and thatit truly is transparent. And I don't think we are meeting that and I think it truly has to hold up to scrutiny by the public. I don't think it's appropriate to bring new slides as much as I appreciate that.But in the middle of the meeting, I think our our I know our community is entitled to when we are selling the community's assets to more because we're not putting the this is another difference. We're not saying we're going to be selling this building.Anyone can come and bid on it. What we are in fact doing is negotiating a lease that happens to have an option to purchase with that one person. That's that one entity that's doing the lease as opposed to having the building for sale at market value.So there is not going to be the competition, for instance, that occurs when any of us go to try it, try to buy a home or rent a piece of property. And none of that happens here. It's all negotiated.And then there is nothing set forth as part of this. The documents that we have intentionally looked at, the fiscal analysis moving forward and the differences of how a lease impacts versus a purchase. So all of that's what I'm looking for when it comes back to us.But I do appreciate that the heading was changed, that it now includes a purchase and option to purchase. But I really think it should be more than that. And in fact, that's something that we get called out for historically is the deal too negotiated behind closed doors and that the public doesn't really know how we arrive atthose figures and that needs to happen, in my opinion. So that being said, did you want to respond?I did want to respond. And what I want to just to offer is that all of last year, Miss Ott did essentially what you're talking about, the analysis regarding the infrastructure, how much was it? Each building's fair share.That analysis is available. It's on our website and I and I, so I understand that. And it is our fault and I think our our job to make sure that we continue to provide that information for new councilmembers and for the public as these things move forward.But much of that analysis has been done that was done last year, prior to prior to these things coming coming forward. But I think your point is well taken and will be sure to make sure that those individual items are identified on each of our staff reports moving forward.Madam Chair.And let me real quick respond to her and say I appreciate that.And and I say I do agree with you that headings should encompass include all the information. But I also am going to take a little bit of exception about the way at least I'm interpreting you, talking about deals negotiated behind closed doors.There are certain topics that by law are discussed in closed session, and real estate transactions are one of those. And the reason for that is that if we were out there in the open bargaining for real estate prices and with negotiating in public, then we would be showing our hand and not getting as good a deal aswe might. And so we all are aware that in closed session the council met with staff, including Ms. Odd and we gave authorization for parameters within which to carry out these negotiations, and that was done. So I mean, at some point certainly the sales price comes out and the lease prices come out and become public.That's what's in these items that are before us today. But it's not a matter that we're trying to hide something from the public. We are abiding by the law. And that's that's part of our responsibility as council members.So I appreciate that. However, it's my understanding, and I'm happy to use our counsel here, it's my understanding that even when we negotiate a deal, that when it comes forward that we should be able to be held up to scrutiny by the public in regards to that number.Yes, that that is correct.Once the deal has been has been arrived at with the developer purchasing party. It has to come before the council and it is all public. The terms of the deal are all made public and the analysis and scrutiny then is is available at that point in time before council would actually vote to approve the transaction.So that's what I'm asking for, is more than just the purchase price, but the analysis be made public. Thank you. All right. So that being said, I'm going to call it a question. All those in favor. I oppose.I oppose. Motion carries a 4 to 1. Thank you. And now. And I apologize. We have one speaker, said Mr. Ernst. Five. Did you want to come and speak? Apologize for that.

On March 17th, there was an agenda item placed by councilmembers Richardson, Gonzales and Urania that resulted in the city council voting 8 to 0 to adopt a minute order to initiate a moratorium process to temporarily prohibit the granting of cup exemptions for certain alcohol related uses in the city.On tonight's agenda is the actual moratorium ordinance that will formalize the moratorium for a 120 day period, while planning staff and the Planning Commission undertake to study a study to determine if the city's current CFP regulations are appropriate or if other zoning regulations need to be put in place.That will better serve the interests of the city and its residents. If the ordinance is adopted to tonight, it will go into effect immediately as an urgency ordinance will apply to any application that may be filed after the date of March 17th and will prohibit the city from issuing any further CFP exemptions until planning staff and thePlanning Commission are able to complete their study and formulate recommendations for the City Council in accordance with the Council's direction on March 17. Both grocery stores and restaurants serving alcohol with meals only without a standalone bar will be exempt from the moratorium and will still be able to apply for a CPA exemption during the moratorium period.Under the city's charter, this action tonight calls for two separate votes. The first motion should be to declare the urgency of this matter so that the ordinance will become effective immediately. And the second motion and vote should be to adopt the ordinances read.That concludes our report. If you have any questions, I'd be glad to answer them.Is there any public comment on the hearing?

And exciting, please.Communication from Councilwoman Gonzalez. Councilmember Muranga, Councilman Austin. Councilmember Richardson. Recommendation to request the city attorney to draft a resolution in support of President Barack Obama's executive actions to reduce gun violence and make our community safer.Thank you. Councilman Gonzales.Yes. I just want to thank my council colleagues for joining me in this release. Symbolic resolution. I think we had addressed this very briefly during our federal legislative committee. And understanding the lay of the land in our nation at this time.I personally thought it was timely for us to do this. And I also want to thank our police department for joining on board, taking a look at the item and helping us out with the language on that. So I think all involved.Appreciate it.Councilmember Ringo.Thank you, Mary. Now, I also want to thank the police department for their cooperation in reviewing this and making it strong and and palatable to them. And I also, of course, thank Councilwoman Dallas for bringing this forward. And more importantly, I want to thank the president for having the courage to put this on the table.It's long overdue. And we do need some very strong background checks when it comes to the purchasing of weapons. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Mongo.I think it's important to note that all of the suggestions posed and the executive actions are already in place here in California, yet they fail to stop incidents such as those that occurred in San Bernardino. We cannot continue to pass more and more gun laws and more and more restrictions on law abiding individuals civil rights.Yet they all. All that it stops is the same law abiding citizens from being able to protect themselves. You are currently not able to buy a gun on the internet and have it shipped to your house without a background check.And therefore, because this item is already exactly what we have, I will not be supporting it this evening.Thank you, Councilman Austin.Well, I'm going to rise in support of this item because I think it's very necessary to raise the consciousness of our residents here in Long Beach, but throughout the country about the the need to reduce gun violence. I think we've been pretty progressive in the city.And in the spirit of that. I think this council getting behind this resolution is the right thing to do. I will remind you that two years ago we had our very first gun buyback program funded by the city council, and it was an item that my arm, Steve Neal and myself brought forward.We also funded a task force to deal with prohibited possessors, using one time funds from our budget to get guns up out of the hands of those who should not have them legally and by court order. And I think we need to do more of that as a council to to deal with the issues we have righthere in our city. And so I'm happy to support this. I think this is the right thing to do. And, yes, I'll be in support.Okay. Thank you, Councilman Richardson.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you, Councilmember Gonzales and all the cosigners for signing on to this. I think what the president is trying to do with certainly the toxic environment in Washington, D.C., to take an executive action. I think he's expressed this time and time again the interest in Congress taking action and seeing that that hasn't happened. He's moved forward on this. So we completely support it. We are. This isn't new. We have support for these reforms in our federal legislative agenda that we voted on today for a number of those. A number of those.And we also have a support for a number of those elements in the state legislative agenda. So this is not new. This goes on to highlight our support for this. So we can say say that, you know, we've explored doing all that we can to help prevent these these ridiculous things from happening in our community.Thank you. That any public comment?

I shared some of that this morning. So this is the current 20 year contract, which the current 20 year contract remains active until February 22 of this year. Both parties and the zoo and the city have negotiated agreement to renew and update policies related to the public benefits, zoo operations, services and care of the animals. As I shared this morning, I want to thank my colleagues on the committee, and those of you who came, who were not part of the committee are Councilmember Strauss and submitted the 15 amendments by November 30th.And we got them all done and I think it's a better deal.

This was difficult because so many people care about the zoo and because the state of research and standards of care and community sentiment all can change so rapidly.In a 28 year agreement committing significant city resources, it was appropriate. I feel that we took the time to carefully consider what was proposed here from stakeholders and debate changes. I'm particularly glad and thankful that we supported requiring council oversight and approval of the long range plan, which will identify the capital and animal habitat changes that thiszoo will pursue for years to come. By requiring approval of the long range plan we are building in a touchpoint where the public will have an opportunity to raise concerns and the Council will have an opportunity to exercise reasonable oversight of significant planned changes to the zoo that may impact its operations, animals or financial health.Over the course of the agreement, I know this was a challenging process, but with coordination required between council and central staff and enforced by Councilmember Juarez, I think the the outcome was was was a very good outcome. And I hope the public agrees and I hope that the zoo agrees.I really appreciate their collaboration on the effort. And I also want to just give a shout out to Brian Goodnight on council central staff who helped us sort through and make sense of a long but important document as well as the staffing of Christina because he was in my office as well.Thank you.Thank you so much, Councilmember.For.Any additional comments.

We're going to have a staff report on this.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Members of the council. We're excited to be here tonight to talk about some of the continuing improvements along our beachfront. These are funded, of course, out of tidelands dollars and not general fund dollars. But we have about a million people a year that walk up and down our beachfront.It's amazing how much activity there is. And there's been a focused effort kind of assisted by Councilmember Price and Councilmember Pierce to really focus on some of the community amenities. And so I hope you've been noticing that over the last couple of years, and this really is kind of the next big step.So with that, I will turn it over to Eric Lopez and Joshua Hickman to go through a presentation.Right. Good evening, Mayor and city council. Happy to be here tonight. So before you tonight is really a holistic effort to activate the waterfront. And we have a multi-phased approach over a number of different locations. You can see the four outlined here on the screen, and each location includes both concession improvements or improvements to the building aswell as play features. So over on the bay shore side of the beach, we've already made some improvements to the concession building itself, shown in the image on the left as well as play features out in the water.Alamitos Beach concession project on the east side of the beach or west side of the beach is under construction now. This is a site plan drawing of the Alamitos Beach concession and the improvements that are happening here. So you can see a play area, a retail restroom, as well as the cafe itself.This is an image showing the playground that is being installed at the Almeida's location. You can see there's a number of different play features that that are being included in that construction that's underway now. At the Gina Paris location.There's a number of different improvements that are again happening in a phased type of approach. Previously, the beach pedestrian path as well as the bike path were constructed as well as the the parking lot that you can see here.And most recently, the basketball courts and the fitness station as well as the multi-sport court have already been have already been constructed south of the beach path. You can see the concession building and the new playground, which are part of the contract that that we're hoping to award tonight.This is an image of the completed fitness station as well as the basketball and pickleball courts. And this is an image of the the new building facade, including the wayfinding signage, the better access to the facility and new shade structure for the for the for the concession area.Another image of the same facility shown looking north from the beach. This is a play area that's being installed adjacent to the Junipero location. So you can see a fairly large play structure with a slide as well as different climbing areas.Another image of the same play area. At the Granada location. There's also a number of improvements that are taking place. We have the concession building that's receiving similar treatment to the June opera. We have the water play feature highlighted in blue on the screen, as well as a fitness station and a dog rental station.So you can see there's a similar theme among all of the concession areas. So we have wayfinding signage as well as improved access, as well as some shading and some facade treatment. You can see a rendering of the Granada play area or the water play feature.It includes a meandering path as well as water that flows and allows the folks that are playing with it to interact with the water. These are some examples of how children would interact with the water. You would pump the water up into various slides and have it come and flow down through the the meandering path.And then we also have a collaborative effort with other city colleagues that we're working to really get some new beach concessionaire into each of these locations. So that is currently underway. We're working with Lee and Associates to to select those those vendors which will be coming back to you at a future at a future meeting.So the next steps would like to award the construction contract will then get started on the play. Features at both the Junipero and Granada location will then be coming back to City Council for Future Concessionaire agreements and then they would complete their their tenant improvement projects.And that concludes the presentation. We're available for any questions or comments.Thank you. There's a motion and a second counsel on price.Thank you. I want to thank staff for this. Josh Heckman and Eric Lopez have really led this effort. So thank you, gentlemen, for your great work on this. And I want to thank my colleague, Councilmember Pearce. There are three concession stands in total that have been the subject of a lot of attention from us over the lastcouple of years. And of course, Alamitos is a little bit ahead, and I'm really looking forward to what the changes there are going to be. I want to Paro is a shared space really between the second and third district.It kind of borders our two districts. And then Granada is in the third. And for those who don't know, it's really close to Rosie's Dog Beach, which is going to be great to have the dog walkers station and have that water element there.Really looking forward to seeing these changes. I wasn't surprised, but I think I was I was happy to get reaffirmation on the number of people that are visiting the beach since we put the beach path in, the fact that we can count how many people are out there now is amazing.For those of us who go out there on a regular basis, it's really a great sight to see. No matter what time of day or night. You go out there, you see people of all different walks of life enjoying the beach and the open space and it's really great to see.So this will be a nice amenity to add there. And I think a lot of people don't know that the basketball courts are already there at one to Paro. And so hopefully people will go out there and use those more so that we can give a little bit of relief to other impacted courts like the one atBay Shore. But I want to thank you guys for your great work and for bringing this project forward. All three of these beach concession stands together are going to provide a really great new amenity for beachgoers. So thank you.Thank you. Got some repairs?Yes, I too. Thank you guys so much for the work that you guys have done on this. It's really been three years in the making. When I first got in office, we started doing the visioning work and I actually want to make sure that the record shows because the item says District three, but two of them arein District two. So just make sure that the you know, we have some pride over there. But with that said, we know that all of these concession stands are really used by a lot of people throughout the city, not just in our districts.Anytime I'm out there, I'll see constituents that don't live in my district that have taken the bus or taken their bike down there to really enjoy the beach path. So congratulations on that. I know I've talked to a couple of local restauranteurs and I know it's kind of a challenge now that we put the local spin onit and trying to get one of our local businesses in these concession stands. Can you share with me the timeline one on the completion of Alamitos and then two, the timeline for the RFP process? Because I know it's it's kind of been tough.Sure. So the Alamitos Construction Project is again a multiphase type approach where we have a core and shell project that's underway now and we're anticipating being complete with that fall of 2020. And subsequent to that, we'll have a tenant improvement project.So we're hoping to select in the upcoming months a future concessionaire for that for that facility. And then they will go through with their own tenant improvement project after we're complete.And are we looking at one tenant for Alamitos or two?So it's still an open discussion as to who the tenant will be there. We envision that there will be a tenant there for both retail as well as a cafe.Okay. I just ask because I had talked to a local brewery last week and they had said that they had been approached about just operating the top. And so I was just curious to that process. But I trust you guys.I think all the projects have been great. Thank goodness. On the Pickleball court, when I first said Pickleball, I never thought we would get a pickleball court there. My constituents are very happy. So thank you.Thank you. I just want to just add, because I've been a I've been a huge supporter of these projects for for many years. I'm very excited at the work that's being done, the quality, just what it's going to do for activation on the beach.They're also part of our kind of master Olympic plan to ensure that when the Olympics are here, folks are at a fully activated beach. And I think I want to particularly what I also think. Mr. Modica, I think, Tom, you have been our leading advocate for these projects in the city, and we've been working on these fora long time. And I just want to thank you and the team. I think obviously the whole Tidelands team and and the teams that's been working on it has been really great. But I just want to thank you guys.And also just to piggyback on something Councilmember Pearce said, I think it's really important that we. Ensure that we have quality service providers as it relates to food and beverage on these on these sites. And so I hope that as you proceed with the RFP process, that if you feel that we're not getting an adequate response, don'thesitate to come back. If you feel you need to change the parameters of whatever we have set within those. Because I also heard that maybe that that maybe the RFP process was a little limiting. I'm not sure if that's been the case or not, but if it has, I would much rather get a home run at withthese are these are home run sites that deserve home, home run food and beverage. And so Mr. Maurer could give any comment on that.Yes. Thank you, Mayor. Those are those are great comments. We absolutely agree. We did do an original RFP and it actually didn't produce what we thought it would produce. So we changed courses. We brought on a broker, a local broker who's been really helping us.But we appreciate the flexibility. So we agree it may take a little bit longer to find the right mix, but we really deserve to have amazing concessions that are unique and fun. So we appreciate the leadership of the entire council.We've had a number of discussions with District two, District three and the mayor about how our beaches need to be really special. So we feel we're on that path and really appreciate the comments and the work of the team.Thank you. And let me and then the final thing I'll say and I'll turn to Councilman Mongo is and I think Councilmember Ranga will understand this. I'm going to put my former coastal commissioner hat on. And I think that one of the things that I really like about this project, and it's the reason why I supported thethe walking and bike path that we put out. A lot of these projects oftentimes get opposition and there is opposition on these projects from folks that want to preserve as much of the beach as possible in its current form.And I think what people oftentimes forget is if we really want to create access to the beach and access to open space, you need to provide the types of services and the types of amenities at these public spaces that will get folks actually come.And I think what we have seen with the example of the the additional path, which was a as we remember opposed and these new amenities, including the basketball courts that I see activated almost every single time that I'm on the path.I see, you know, young, young people playing basketball on those new courts. That, to me, is what the true mission of access to the coast is all about, which is bringing people to enjoy this beautiful coastline. And so I'm really grateful that you guys have worked so hard on doing this and creating these spaces on the beachfor people to enjoy and for all families to enjoy, not just in a passive way, but also in a way that keeps our young kids active. So thank you very much for that. Councilman Mongeau.I just want to agree and thank all that worked on a recent concession RFP that came out for the fifth District. And I think that.While the number of.Applicants was small, they were mighty. And I think that echoing the comments about the home run are really important. And then just to consider and I know we're very fortunate, the fifth District procurement proposals were all local. And I think that local hire and local business expansion is a huge opportunity that also should get additional weight becausethey're.Proven.To be within the liking of the community. So when you look at that and the vision of the facilities, I'm really excited for what's possible.Thank you. There's a motion and a second. I don't have any public comment in front of me. Right.

Councilman Richardson.Thank you. I wanted to just take a moment and acknowledge the Veterans Affairs Commission and the hard work that they've led. This was one of the third, fourth proposals I brought. The city council was to begin the process of developing this new commission.And I'm really proud of the support that the city council and the Budget Committee and everyone has led to establishing this in the Health Department. We're really proud of their work and we want to see and I'm looking forward to this update.And side note, I want to just sort of refresh this issue that that Veterans Affairs strategic plan is still seeking funding. It's been pegged about $40,000 needed. So we're going to try to advocate for that in this upcoming budget.And so we'll try to keep that issue alive. But I look forward to this this presentation.At the presentation.Thank you. Good evening. Honorable Mayor and council members like to introduce Gina OVERHOLT. She is our program manager for the Veterans Affairs Commission and she'll give a brief report and will be open for questions at the end. Thank you, Kelly.Honorable Mayor Garcia and council members, thank you for the opportunity to provide you with this brief update on the Veterans Affairs Commission. I'm Gina OVERHOLT, the coordinator for the Veterans Affairs Commission, which is administered administrated by the Health Department.Our core purpose, the Long Beach Veterans Commission and advises City Council on matters of importance to veterans in our city. This slide continues and shows additional details on the rules of the commission. It highlights the many achievements of those who have dedicated their lives to protecting the country.Serves as an advisory body to the Council regarding the well-being of military veterans. Provides recommendations pertaining to the affairs of veterans. Evaluates and recommends programs, policies and practices to assist veterans and acts as a central clearinghouse for information, programs and services relating to veterans.One of our objectives. Oh, I'm sorry. The original ordinance ordinance requires that at least four of the nine commissioners be veterans. One from each council district is the nine. We have seven out of nine commissioners are veterans. One of our objectives to act as a central clearinghouse for information, programs and services relating to veterans.Towards this end, we created a Facebook group page where we post on the average five times a week. So the that's just a snapshot of the the cover page and the URL is at the top. So I invite you to be one of the 200 plus followers that we have.Another one of our objectives is to provide recommendations pertaining to the affairs of veterans residing within our city. Towards this end, we've worked with other city departments such as Long Beach Fire. We provided input on the impact of 4th of July fireworks on veterans with PTSD and collaborated on the social media campaign developed around this issue.So this is an example of one of the messages. City Council, as you know, tests the commission with developing a strategic plan that includes programs and policies designed to assist veterans in multiple capacities and build stronger connections between local veterans and the community.What does the commission recommend that the city do to serve and support veterans over the next 2 to 3 years? The plan's recommendations must be thoroughly vetted, supported by data and well-developed, so they provide specific action plans to achieve strategic goals and objectives.The Commission developed temporary working goals based on their insights and expertize as a starting point. Goal one Economic Development Increase veteran employment by advising the City Council on ways to increase transitional employment opportunities, patronage of veteran owned businesses and private business ownership for veterans.Goal two Awareness and Recognition Increase awareness and recognition of all Long Beach Veterans, Service members and their families by advising the City Council on ways to regularly celebrate and recognize our veterans. Goal three Information Resources and Social Support to serve as a clearinghouse for information pertaining to resources, services and social support available to veterans in the LongBeach area. In collaboration with the city and and by advising the City Council, go for underrepresented groups. Identify and raise awareness of underrepresented veteran populations by advising the City Council about groups that may not identify as veterans and therefore may not seek assistance.So where we are now, we've developed a work plan to complete the strategic plan with existing staff collecting data. What exists on the Long Beach veterans population? What data exists on the Long Beach population already? And how do we access it?The next steps data analysis, identifying stakeholders and stakeholder interviews. And the plan is slated for release in July next summer. So I wanted to. Take a moment to invite you to the recognition ceremony for Lone Sailor. We're working with Partners of Parkes on this.It's on Saturday, October 13th, 10:10 a.m. to noon with the presentation starting at 11. The lone sailor is is in Bluff Park at Ocean and Paloma. So then I also wanted to take a moment to let you know that Long Beach Veterans Affairs Commission will also be participating in the 21st annual Veterans Day parade.We invite you to the Veterans Day Parade and Festival, which kicks off at 10 a.m. on Atlantic Avenue in North Long Beach. So the Long Beach Veterans Affairs Commission meets on the second Wednesday of the month at 5 p.m. at the Health Department's main building on Grand Avenue.Thank you, honorable Mayor and Council members for the opportunity to provide this update on the Veterans Affairs Commission. This concludes my presentation and I'm now open for questions.Thank you very much for that presentation. That was great. And I know that we have some of our commissioners here as well. And I just wanted to also thank them for their incredible work on the Commission of Councilor Richardson.Oh, I echo that. Congratulations. We want to make sure that we continue to support this commission. We. I'm really impressed at how engaged all of you have become. You've attended numerous events you were engaged in. You were there when we opened up the new veterans Fowler Plaza at Highland Park.And I look forward to getting you the resources working to get you the resources you need to present a really comprehensive, strategic plan that we can take very seriously. I applaud the work you've already done. The fact that a lot of the things you called out are in alignment with many of the things we've brought up interms of including ensuring that veterans are included in our economic development strategies and that we continue to place a laser focus on underrepresented groups. So thank you for your hard work and I'm really proud to support you and continue the good work that you're doing.Thank you. Catherine Ashton.Thank you. Also, I second this motion. Thank you for the great report. I want to just recognize the veterans commission because this is a one of our newer commissions and you guys have really stepped up and really taking your role seriously to the point where I think, you know, they've had to say, hey, slow down a littlebit, but I'm glad to see that there there's some focus of some some guidance. I speak regularly with our veterans of the commission representative for the eighth District, Sylvia Contreras, her and her husband. I know they're very, very involved.You continue to have my support. And like I said, I'm very encouraged by this report here and keep up the great work. Thank you.Thank you. Councilwoman Gonzalez.I just want to say thank you as well. I come from a long line of veterans and my family. Also being I was married to a marine for that went to Iraq. So a lot of people don't know that about me, but that is really I just really love this commission and all that it's done.What I'm specifically appreciative of is the data analysis portion. And so we're having discussions about digital inclusion. And I would love, as were growing that discussion and including more members, I would love to have one of the members of the Commission come to the digital inclusion discussions to talk about from your angle, what would make that initiativemuch better. So thank you for your service, your service not to just the city but the country as well. Thank you.Councilor Pearce.I want to echo the same appreciation for service, appreciation for staff. I know our commission sometimes it depends on how much staff energy and how much time and how the commission works together. And this is one of the commissions that I think everyone that's invested in it, including the council members in North Long Beach, have done agreat job on. So thank you very much. I look forward to continue to work. I'm particularly excited about the job opportunities in the transitional piece, so let me know how I can help you all.Thank you. I'm closing the council comments. Any other public comment on this? Sorry. And please come forward so we can move on. Go ahead, sir. Thank you very much. When I was with the five state lawmakers. The state doesn't do a whole lot in terms of veterans.That's usually the feds or the county. And so very much I commend the city, commend the commissioners and the sponsor for this. One of the things that is one of your points is the economy. There are 3 million who have served in uniform in the last 20 years in open war.And in light of those 3 million people, a lot of businesses are aggressively pursuing employees who are veterans. Starbucks, if you're going to go to Starbucks, they are hiring 25,000. Staff personnel who are in have been in uniform.So when you find businesses who do encourage military service personnel. Absolutely. You can engage that. This was the capital of the Pacific fleet for almost 80 years. The presence of Mr. Roosevelt as the head of the Navy in World War One and as president in World War Two, does remind that, honey, that Long Beach is at thecenter of the military status of this nation. So absolutely not only do you have jobs that can be encouraged, but if you had a V to the letter B and B, your bed and breakfast can be VB and beans.You can lead the nation by the creation of an encouraged growth of tourism with veterans, with VB and B you can tell the local businesses. Why don't you give some discounts to veterans coming over? Why don't you give some lower costs for rooms?Why don't you give some housing that is for a month? Why don't you give some meals that are for free? VB And BS is something that can be a tourism growth for this city. Thank you, sir. Please cast your votes, members.Motion carries.Thank you. So I want to let me hear. If I call your name, please line up so we can make this expeditious sampler, this Bill Shorten and just trying to get folks that are in different groups. So let me start with Bill.\nReasoning:Reasoning:",

I first want to thank Amy for all of her work and her energy and her expertize that she put into getting this project to the state we're in. I also want to thank the city staff and the council members and also CASA, who have been instrumental in bringing this projectto this path to this point. As we said in our letters over time, DPA Park is an opportunity that that would be a must take. Without repeating all the details. I'll just say that it will make when it's built.They'll be a unique resource for wildlife because it's located. It'll have significant potential to sequester carbon. And it will be a beautiful place of respite and of learning for all our means. So we'll get are I'm speaking on behalf of urges you to vote in favor of the grant application and matching funding.That's it.Thank you. Our next speaker is Abby. Good evening. Speaker Abby.Good evening, Madam Mayor. Members of the City Council. Community Action for Sustainable Alameda seconds is the recommendation of the Audubon Society and the Sierra Club and others who have weighed in and supported this work. I did want to just say that we were very supportive of the idea of the matching funds.We think that that would make.A difference in the application. The city did apply last year.And was not successful and we really think that it is important to do the level of matching funds. If you recall, when we were at the budget hearings, we.Were looking for $280,000. So $50,000 would be a bargain.So that's it. Thank you very much. Coming.Thank you. Good night. Our next speaker.Is our last speaker. Okay.I'm closing public comment on this item. But, you know, actually, for the benefit of the public and I know this, voters can do this really quickly. In a nutshell, tell us what it is we're voting on in this resolution tonight.Please disclosure and welcome our recreation Parks Department director.Thank you, Mariza Ashcroft. And if I will keep it brief, but if we could please have a slide. The presentation, it's very version share while that's coming up. Deep park concept is it's a park in which all existing concrete from a formal naval base or air filled runway system is removed.And it's intended to inundate over time to create tidal wetlands and wildlife habitat and adapt to sea level rise. So what you see what we're presenting here, next slide, please, is a high level vision vision plan. That was it's from a high level vision plan that was conducted in the spring of 2020.And I want to really emphasize to counsel the community that there's significantly more work to do to solicit the broad and diverse community input. And this grant would do that through one component of what we're asking for funding in this grant.So $1.2 million grant is a master plan process that would be an in-depth process, community wide and with a diverse group of our constituents and all of our community. This plan before you. The vision includes elevated picnic area, bike, ped trails, viewing areas, and it also creates which is unique additional subtitled habitat including oysters eelgrass that sequestercarbon. So this is a park that will sequester carbon pretty quickly. As was mentioned by one of the speakers by Ms.. Abbey, that the grant was not awarded last year. But we did receive a lot of positive feedback and constructive criticism that I've incorporated into the next grant application.One of those things was was wanting to see the skin city has some skin in the game essentially that the city is committed to this project and a funding match does that. The last thing I wanted to mention is that the Saturday on September 25th, the city in collaboration with Alameda Point Collaborative and CASA is hosting atour of the park specific for Alameda Point Collaborative residents since they live out at Alameda Point. And so their voices are really important in this process. And so the tour will include education about parks in the area as well as wildlife at a limited point and overview.And then a design charrette really intended to learn more about what residents want from this park. And then all of that feedback from this event will be incorporated into the planning process. So with that, I'm open to any questions.Thank you. And I just want to say it was my privilege to work with Ms. Wooldridge on a newspaper article that I authored about D Page Park and the second our second chance efforts. And so thank you so much for all your hard work in helping educate me.So with that, I think I first saw Vice Mayor Vela's hand and then counts her not quite right hand. So I don't know if there's question or motion that Vice Mayor Vella know is that.I'm moving approval. And I think that if we can, you know, I appreciate the work that's gone into reaching out to the community. I just want to continue to encourage those conversations and to have them continue and to be meaningful and with the with the neighbors without move approval.Thank you. And by Councilmember Knox White.Yeah. So I will second the motion with my my also appreciation and just that the comment that I'm really glad that we've gotten here where where we actually are doing the outreach to the people who live there. And just a reminder to all of us that, well, we have lots of people who are experts in lots ofplaces. We're not building something for everybody if everybody's not at the table. At the beginning, I one of my coworkers always has the if you're not at the table, you're what's for dinner. This is his his statement. And, you know, I really appreciate that we found a way to bring the bring bring the residents who actually willbe closest to this park into the process before the process begins.Thank you. Thank you. And we have an emotion, a second comment. Councilmember Herrera Spencer.Thank you. I have a clarifying question. I know. And I noticed that in the vision plan B, paiva spelled as one word capital P and no hyphen. However, in the staff report it has a hyphen throughout. So my suggestion would be to come up with how we're going to spell it and then be consistent throughout.And also I want to confirm that we are not I noticed in a building 25 and 29, I actually want to have a whole discussion on whether or not what we're going to do with them. And I want to make sure to affirm that we are not agreeing to demolish those buildings by granted approving this grant.Yes. But we're not.Proving just for clarification, we're not approving a grant where we're approving a resolution to allow us to apply for a grant. And but I misquoted your you, Fiona.I just want to add that I didn't actually get to the final couple of slides for, for brevity sake, but building 25 and building 29 and then those and how they sit within the park will be a major topic of conversation for as part of the master planning process that this grant would fund and would enable.Right. Yeah. Okay. And I hope that it someday we find a new name other than the Pave Park, but it's a great place holder. Okay. We've had a motion, we've had a second clarifying questions. Anything further seeing them?Let's have a roll call vote, please.Some objection.

Or should we just push it to another agenda? Because I don't I don't think that 70 is correct.But Mr. Leavitt, if you wanted to. I think you're still muted on one level.Oh, we've had a lot of public comment on it, but public comment, I know that there's been a lot of desire from many council members to add this come forward. So it could potentially be.Are we ready to queue it up? Should we give it a shot? Give it a go. I want to say that. Okay.

A resolution concerning the health, well-being and safety of domestic workers, expressing council's intent to establish a right to portable paidtime off for domestic workers in Seattle and requesting the Office of Labor Standards to work with community stakeholders to draft legislation creating a portable policy for domestic workers. The committee recommends the City Council adopt the resolution with councilmembers Macheda Herbold, Gonzales, Suarez, Lewis, Morales and Strauss in favor and Councilmember Peterson abstaining.Thank you so much, Madam Clerk. Are there any comments on resolution 32028? Agenda item seven. Councilor, Mosquito Council president, colleagues, I'm excited about this resolution as a corresponding piece of legislation to pass today along with the budget. The COVID 19 pandemic really has amplified the inequities that are inherent in our current treatment of frontline essential workers.This inequity that we are seeing across many industries exponentially impacts communities of color, workers of color. And there has been a clear impact on domestic workers as well. I am excited about the legislation in front of us that will continue the path of good policymaking that's rooted in community experience, rooted in the experience of those who arethe frontline workers themselves, in this case, domestic workers. This piece of legislation builds on the $500,000 that the mayor also included in her proposed budget that the council is continuing to include in our proposed budget and works on policy development in collaboration with community partners such as the Domestic Worker Standards Board and the Affordable Benefits Coalition todevelop policy to expand upon the benefits of the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights codified two years ago. We all believe that workers deserve respect and all worker on all workers should have dignity. And the legislation in front of us that corresponds with ongoing conversations throughout next year will allow for us as a city, as a city familyto develop in partnership with community, a policy that outlines how to ensure there's paid time off for caregivers and their families so that they can care for their kiddos and their elders as well. No worker should be forced to choose between working while sick or facing lost wages.But until we ensure that there is a paid time off policy that can correspond to the work of domestic work which has many different hiring entities, often we are in a situation where disparity continues. I look forward to continuing to work with community partners and hearing more from cities like San Francisco and Philadelphia who have passed orare considering ordinances protecting the right for paid time off to domestic workers. Those cities are currently working on legislation and implementation to make sure that this commitment is a reality. I really love that we are on the national stage for all of the work that you all supported with the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights, that national conversationcontinues to center around how domestic workers have a clear path to paid leave when they need it. So thank you all for your consideration of this resolution in front of us today, which is really about the ongoing work that we will commit to in 2022 with community as and this correlates to the $500,000 included in the 2022budget process for other aspects which include doing outreach, engagement with hiring entities, community partners, and the necessary work for education and enforcement. I look forward to hearing more in 2022 as we develop this policy together. Thank you, Councilor.Was there any additional comments on resolution 32028 Agenda item seven? What I wanted to think.

There is just one related to at some point asking council to have project updates on where we're at in the scope of the project.How far along are they and where are we with funding? Have we added new dollars? Have we used only the dollars that were built within those projects on plot to Park Hill and on the National Western Center?

That Texas item on today's agenda. This is the second piece of legislation that would request the executive create a blue ribbon panel of experts to address issues related to the economic recovery. We have Cliff Cory from Council Central South to provide a brief high level overview.Mr. Cory. If you please proceed. Thank you, Mr. Chair. This discussing career of council staff. Good afternoon. The materials for this and begin with the staff report on page 83 of your packet today. Basically, this proposed motion would call on the executive to establish a blue ribbon panel named the Corona's A Coronavirus Recovery Economic Task Force, orthe Cure Task Force, which would be made up of enumerated state and local government leaders, along with business and industry representatives and other leaders, to identify issues and make recommendations for the economic recovery to the COVID 19 pandemic.The motion establishes the membership, and it also would require that the executive begin the establishment of the task force by May 15th and be prepared to report to the Council its recommendations within three months of the effective date of this motion.So basically, assuming action on this, it would be within three months, with the concept being that the industry leaders would come together along with other governmental leaders, union leaders, members of the community who are affected by the pandemic to discuss what would be needed and recovery efforts very similar to the recovery from any major disaster.Those recommendations would be formulated and would be ultimately form the basis for the recovery plan for the county looking for both economic recovery and other recovery. And with that, Mr. Chair, there is a striking amendment that incorporates format and technical changes recommended by the Code Advisor and makes no substantive changes.And if there are any questions for me. Thank you to my staff. Thank you, Mr. Curry. Questions for Mr. Curry. Hearing no questions from Mr. Curry Council member Dunn as the maker of the motion. Thank you, Mr. Chair.Can you hear me okay? Yes. Okay, great. Thanks. And I wanted to first commend Cliff Curry for his work on this in a very quick turnaround time and in his work doing it mostly from home as well. What the your taskforce seeks to do is put a blue ribbon commission together.As Cliff indicated, that would be of local and state government leaders combined with various labor and other communities of interest representatives, as well as the business community. The idea is that we are going to be dealing with COVID 19 for a while, but as it recedes, we're going to be left with a substantially down economy.Given the sheer dollars, federal stimulus dollars and other moneys from both state and local governments being put in. We want to be among the first communities in the United States to emerge, and it will be all about the jobs and it'll be all about the economy.As we saw 2000 and 2009, the top three issues were jobs in the economy and jobs in the economy and jobs in the economy. We're going to be there soon enough. And so what we want to do is create a working group of individuals from all the communities.We have to really prime the pump and get the economy moving in ways that maybe we don't think of in our limited stovepipes here at local government. Maybe Microsoft doesn't think of in their stovepipe, the health care sector, in their stovepipe.But together, collaboration will generate the ideas we need. I have been talking with executive staff. I've been talking with the chair of the King County Council chair about duty. And we are going to come together, I believe, also with Team Caldwell's Sierra budget, to further refine this basic concept.And I commend Chair Balducci for her leadership on the needs assessment. That's a very, very important document. And what it is what it does in part is to sort of look internally at the needs, but also externally. What this would do is look very externally and long term at jobs and the economy.And how we dovetail those two together, I think will be an important role for all of us moving forward. So that's just kind of the primer. I'm not expecting a vote on this matter today and look forward to improving this particular motion as we move forward.But thank you for the discussion.And your share. This is quite a.Councilmember ability.Validity. There's always answer that the way I answer the phone, I yeah. I want to I want to add my thanks to Councilmember Dunn as to the previous motion to the making of the previous motion. There's just a lot to do.And and we are going to be struggling to come out of where we are today, where we're going after this. I think there's a question of a real debate, but how we get there, we definitely will need to work with representatives of the different sectors.So I did talk to Councilmember Dunn and others, and I think part of what we need to do is get our arms around the lay of the land a little bit. There are a lot of tables convening right now.The governor has several sector tables with the construction industry, the restaurant industry. They're talking to the automotive industry. And there's an effort coming together at Chambers of Commerce and business groups, having to do with large businesses, different ones having to do with smaller businesses, different parts of the county.And I think that it's really a good idea to have a discussion with a delegation from the council, as Councilmember Dunn described and the executive, to just wrap our brain around where we're going and how we work together, what is the lane of the county can occupy?I will just share my $0.02. I think there's two ways you can go with this. You can go big or you can go small and big is we try to coordinate everything county wide. I don't know if we're in a position to do that, but if there's a coordination role that's missing, sometimes that is our role andsmaller is that we consider what are the county things that just we can do that only we can do, for example, as the health orders start to ramp down because we we continue on the path that we're on and maybe are able to start gradually loosening health orders without seeing a big rebound.What does that look like for small businesses without looking for restaurants? What does that look like for people to start coming out? They'll need more guidance than they probably got going in. So I suppose. The idea of having a further conversation across branches and then coming back with either a striking amendment or some other proposal as appropriate. And again, thank us, everyone, for being flexible with this and joining in conversation about how we can do something as Matt, how we really fix this. That's how we fix. Ultimately, people's ability to pay the rent is to get the economy going again so people can work and make money.And I'll stop there. Thank you, Mr. Chair.Thank you, colleagues. Councilmember Dunn, Councilmember Balducci, I want to thank you for introducing the legislation and kicking off the discussion today, and we'll look forward to more work and further action. That concludes the items on our agenda for today.Before we adjourn, I want to make sure that technical difficulties didn't prevent any council members from voting. Ms.. Calderon I don't believe there are any members excused for missing some votes. Can you confirm that for me?Yes. As a member, there was all the votes were recorded.\nReasoning:Reasoning:",

Vice Mayor, members of the council, and Aaron Smith, a current deputy soon to be interim public works director. Thank you for the opportunity to serve. Tonight is public hearings for proposed revisions to our sewer service charge.I also will keep things brief. I appreciate the agenda shifting as we do have a staff member downstairs. Back in April, we presented a rate study to council that was prepared by our consultant, Bartle Wells. That rate study looked at funding needs and revenue sources for the sewer program and recommended a 3% annual increase over the nextfive years. That's 3% per year for the next five years. Just to be clear, the objectives of that rate increase are multifold. One is sufficient funding for pipeline replacement, capital improvements and operating costs. We want to maintain sufficient operating and capital reserves to meet any debt coverage requirements that we have and of course, mitigate impacts to ratepayerssmoothing out the rate and avoiding rate spikes in the future. I want to take just a minute to highlight some accomplishments of the sure program since the federal consent decree was in place in 2014. We have met and exceeded all requirements.And just to refresh memories, the two primary objectives of our consent decree are is to reduce the amount of stormwater entering our sewer system, particularly during rain events where that excess flow exceeds the regional treatment capacity and partially treated wastewater discharged to the bay.The other objective is to minimize or eliminate overflows from our collection system onto streets or back up in people's properties. So to date, in the last six years, under federal court order, we've replaced 20 miles of old sewer main.That's about 15% of our collection system. That shifts the average age from nearly 90 years to 55. So a significant accomplishment, but a lot more to be done to avoid failures. A reminder that this work is guided by a 20 year rehabilitation plan that's in our sewer master plan that is prioritized based upon condition assessment.It's also renovated nearly 80% of our 32 excuse me, 34 pumping facilities. And with the island flat, dependable pumping facilities is essential for continued service. We need to continue forward with this good work. And the study identifies the 3% increase in order to do so.Back in April when the rate study went to council. Council also adopted a resolution declaring their intent to revise the sewer service charge. Shortly thereafter, we sent over 20,000 notices to affected property owners, announcing the public hearing this evening, giving instruction for submission of protest.As of 530 this evening, we had 14 protests and just texting the individual downstairs. We've received none this evening. So that leaves 14 total protest, which is not the majority, which allows council to move forward in voting on the ordinance, which puts forth the rate increase.And with that, I can answer questions and report.Thank you, Miss Smith. Any council questions for staff? Do we have emotion?Do we have any public comment?I'm so sorry.I try. Okay. We have no comment, so we're all right.I'm not. Okay. So no public comment. We'll close up a comment and and I will initiate a movement motion. So move gets then move by Councilmember Odie. And do I have a second? People are going to be here a long time.Councilmember de 6 seconds.With a.Comment.Yes. Comment. Councilmember Desai, quick comment.When you look at the bottles and well study in table three, we have a comparison of the city of Alameda, monthly service charge for a single family residence and it compares it against Berkeley, Oakland, Albany and Piedmont. And we come out pretty favorable in terms of how it what our rates are.The typical monthly rate is for a single family home. Emeryville has a much lower rate than Alameda. But when you look at Alameda relative to other cities in North Alameda County, we come out pretty well. So. So that's why I, I certainly support this and we're paying it right now.And the new amount that we're going to pay next year at 3% increase is relatively reasonable.All right. Thank you for your comments. Okay. It's been moved and seconded. Any further discussion? Maybe we have a roll call vote, please.Councilor Dayton, Guy Knox White.Hi.Hi.

Let me share my screen and I am going to turn off my video because I'm a little glitchy on my end. I don't know if it's the storm that apologies me.Sounds good.Are you able to see full screen Madam Council? Madam President, apologies. Okay. Yep.We got it.Getting used to it. This is my second one. So here we go. Another your rezoning for you all. Nothing too exciting, but I'll try to go quickly. Good evening. My name is Valerie Arara, associate city planner with CPD and I will be presenting a rezoning case for the subject property located at 3030 North Newton Street.The request is for urban single units C one to allow for a detached accessory dwelling unit or for short adu in the rear of the loft. The subject. Property is within District one under Councilwoman Sandoval and is located within the West Highland neighborhood.The subject property is currently set about 6350 square feet with a zone width of 50 feet. The existing zoning, the subject property and the surrounding properties in all directions. Are you, as you see, which allows for urban houses with a minimum zone, lot of 5500 square feet to the north along west 32nd Avenue is umx2 and umsthree and a block to the south is c mpi two zoning. Furthermore us you a makes up most of the eastern portion of residential low and to the north you also have SUV. The site is a single unit residential land use with a mix of two unit and multi-unit existing uses in the neighborhood, as well as somecommercial office and public. Quasi public. This property is within the Wolfe Place Historic District. The subject site is within I'm sorry, that has a period of significance spanning from 1883 to 1926, and the property is subject to additional design review through the Landmark Division.The subject property is mid-block with alley access. There is an existing primary single unit structure and a detached, detached garage accessory structure currently on the lot. Nearby properties are shown on the top and bottom of the screen. In terms of process the map.And then it went to planning board on Wednesday, March 31st, where the item was recommended approval on the consent agenda. The rezoning was moved forward to a final hearing of city council by the Land Use Transportation and Infrastructure Committee or Looby on consent and is being heard today.For public outreach staff received a response from the West Highland Neighborhood Association, which states Land Use and Planning Committee of W, H and A remains neutral to proposed minor rezonings for ADU allowance. The entire neighborhood co-op or ANC, also sent an email expressing support of ADU programs and streamlining the process.To date, staff has received three emails from nearby neighbors included in the application stating no objection to the proposed rezoning. As you know, the Denver zoning code has five review criteria. The first is consistency with adopted plan, starting with comprehensive plan 2040.Staff found this rezoning to be consistent with several strategies shown here from the Comprehensive Plan 2040, more specific to equity affordability and inclusivity from the Plan 2040 Vision Elements. Staff found this rezoning to be consistent with the goals listed here that encourage increased development of housing use units close to transit, a greater mix of housing options inevery neighborhood for all individuals and families, and ensuring that every neighborhood provide a complete range of housing options. In speaking to environment and climate, Vision Element staff found that this reasoning is consistent with the goal listed here that encouraged encourages promotion of infill development where infrastructure and services are already available.Blueprint. Denver maps this area as the urban context. And Residential low, which consists of predominantly single and two unit uses on smaller lots and allows for accessory dwelling units to be thoughtfully and appropriately integrated where compatible.Oops.Sorry. You must miss. Four criteria. Number two and three staff found that this rezoning is consistent with adopted plans, and the proposed rezoning will result in uniform application of the zoned district building form, use and design regulations, and it will further public health, safety and welfare through implementing adopted plans and facilitating increased housing density.Staff found that the proposed rezoning is justified through a city adopted plan, which we know is the blueprint. Denver Land Use and Transport Transportation Plan that was updated in 2018. And finally, the context zone, district purpose and intent of U.S, uc1 are all appropriate for this particular location, giving the surrounding area and the adopted plan guidance. Given the finding that all review criteria have been met, Stapp recommends approval of the rezoning. Approval of a rezoning is not approval of a proposed specific development project.Thank you.All right. Thank you, Val. We'll go ahead and have you stop the screen sharing right on this evening. Council has not received any written testimony on Council Bill 370, and we have one individual signed up to speak this evening, and our individual speaker is Jesse Perez.We'll go ahead and get Jesse into the queue. There you go. Go ahead with your comments, please, Jesse.Yes. Good evening, counsel. My name is Jesse, listed on Paris. Move for self defense, positive action coming in for social change as well as the Unity Party of Colorado in front frontline black nose. And I'll be the next mayor of Denver in 2023.We're in favor of this rezoning tonight. It meets all five of the criteria. So there's really nothing I can say that's going to change the vote on this. I just wanted to know what the demographics of this occupation are, because we keep having this same issue with this brother named John Johnson, who's trying to get this rezoningin the same district. So if someone could please answer that question, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.All right. Thank you, Jesse. That concludes our speakers questions from members of Council on Council Bill 370. Councilmember Sandoval.Thank you, Madam President. One question, Valerie, because this is in a historic district. Does this to 80 years have to go through the design review process and get approved by the Landmarks Preservation Commission?Yes, Councilman Sandoval. That is correct. The subject property is subject to additional review by our landmark division.Perfect. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.All right. Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval. And seeing no other hands raised for questions. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 370. Councilmember Sandoval.Thank you, Madam President. This is within the West Highland Neighborhood Association. And as the letter stated, the R.A., the registered neighborhood organization, did not take a stand for an accessory dwelling unit. But one thing I would like to say, because it is in this vicinity, is my council aide Naomi Judd presented to the West Highland Neighborhood Association. And I think we have our eyes set on rezoning West Highland to allow accessory dwelling units. So more will be coming in from Council District one. We've been reached out to by numerous constituents of minor who are dealing with one off rezoning and it seems like there is a need to be had a more comprehensive approach likeI've done in other neighborhoods so that surveys come in. So stay tuned. But for this one, I believe it meets all the criteria and it also does get a little bit more scrutiny and design review because it is within one of the two historic districts with in that neighborhood.Thank you, Madam President.Thank you. Councilmember Sandoval. Councilmember Hines.EU Council President. Thank you CBD for your amazing report. Good job on your second one. Taking inspiration.All right. Thank you, Councilmember Hines. All right. And looking at the criteria, it does meet all of the criteria for this rezoning. And so happy to support this this evening as well. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 370.Sandoval.I.Sawyer, I. Torres. I. Black I. CdeBaca, I. Clark.I.Flynn.All right.Herndon.I.Hi. Hi.Cashmere.Hi.Can I.Madam President.I.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThank you. And item 18, please. And I think I am 18. Oh, no, that's different. Now, I know we probably heard a lot of that in the study session, but it is a separate item. So can we just hear that item?And then Councilman Mango, if you want to make a motion on that.Communication from Councilwoman Mango Councilwoman Price Recommendation, direct city manager and Health Department to provide an update on the latest changes to the state and local health orders, the status of our vaccine rollout, and how residents and businesses may be impacted.Thank you.Okay. Thank you. Do I have anything else on that?No. I just wanted to say that I really appreciate. As I mentioned earlier tonight, I brought forward this item before the city staff agenda as the vaccination rollout. I think that the information was valuable. All our colleagues have an opportunity to pose their questions and bring forward questions from the community.And I want you to know how important that has been. But we've really crossed a couple of great barriers in the last year in terms of being able to look at and understand how we can communicate better with the community.As a lot of families have cut the cord, we hadn't had the opportunity to.Reach.Those individuals through Channel 13, through a council meeting. But now with council meetings on YouTube, it makes it for a wide range of people to see and play back what has happened at city council meetings. And so I feel that it's really important to have presentations like the one we had tonight.So with that, I'm comfortable with this item as it is moving forward without any additional staff presentation, but I hope that we will have regular briefings so that we won't have to consolidate so much information in a two hour presentation, but perhaps more regular short updates as changes occur.Thank you.There's a second by Councilwoman Price to everything.Councilman Price I did just want to acknowledge one thing that wasn't covered in the study session earlier, and that is when the governor lifted the regional stay at home order, the city had the opportunity to prepare its own health orders, and I wanted to acknowledge that our city did that.It made its very specific health orders very swiftly and did so independently, of course, in collaboration and consultation with other cities and health jurisdictions in the county. But I really appreciate that we made it our own and that we followed the state.I thought that really showed a lot of independence as a city with our own health jurisdiction. And I thought it really showed that our health department was listening and trying very, very hard to do the difficult balance of maintaining the public health concerns at the forefront of their health orders, but also acknowledging some of the small businessimpacts and job impacts that residents were facing. So I just wanted to acknowledge that it's not lost on me that our health department acted swiftly and did so independently while still collaborating with other jurisdictions in the region. So thank you for that.Councilman Mongo.Thank you. And then I just had I know that a lot of businesses have reached out to the Forbes line to provide some feedback and some suggestions related to some recent updates that they've had some challenges with either being able to implement and or needing support.Do you anticipate that any adjustments will be made in the next week or two weeks? What is that timeline looking like in terms of being able to receive the feedback from the community and for the Health Department to take into consideration these additional ideas that have come forward?Mr. Modica.Yeah. So health orders don't really have a time. We don't update them like every week or so we update them as the need persists. So if we do have tweaks that need to be done to our health order, our attorney helps to draft those and put those out.We are looking right now about how to get information out to businesses about how to do Superbowl safely, for example. So we'll be communicating on that to make sure that we've got as few crowds and gatherings as possible.We have established in contact with the Restaurant Association and are in discussions with them about just how to make sure that we have the appropriate distance between people and any kind of nuances there that we can do within the state to to implement that.But we do need to follow state state guidance. We can't be any less permissive than what the state allows.And do we still have a direct communication with the state? So for example, I know there was some discussions related to, okay, six feet apart tables versus eight feet apart tables and what other things could be valued like partitions that wouldn't make eight feet apart, tables necessary floor to ceiling, glass or plastic, things like that that havecome forward. Are those being considered and what is the the strategy on communicating that back to the community?Yeah, so we do have the ability to ask questions of the state. They have also changed some of their own regulations. So where before they had said plexiglass was, you know, allowed, especially indoors as a suitable barrier, they don't say that anymore.And as we did the research, we are not finding that they have the but we do have the ability to use plexiglass as a alternative to the six feet. The eight foot is our way to ensure that we're meeting the six feet.We often see tables that are six feet apart, but when you put chairs on either side, then that makes it four feet apart because you push your take your chair away two feet. So that is our own local interpretation of achieving that six foot distance if there's different ways to phrase it or work on that.What we're really trying to accomplish is keeping people the minimum six feet away from other tables and other people, just as we do in every other industry.That's great. And then my last question also comes from the community related to waivers for school reopening. Is there been any progress or update on that?So Kelly covered this. She would do it better than I would. But we I believe in the presentation. It says we do not have any more waivers. So in purple. The waivers go away, but you have to be below 25 per thousand in order to open up school.So it is now that program has ended. We now you have to get down to 25 cases per hundred thousand for five consecutive days and then school districts can submit that safety plan and it goes through both local and state approval and it's only for K through six where you can still have the Cohorting and all thosedifferent guidances as well. That still remains.I appreciate that. I know you and I have talked about that one on one. There's a concentration of schools and church based schools in my district, and I really appreciate you providing that. And we will, of course, provide a link to this information in our newsletter, as always.Thank you so much.Roll call. Vote, please.District one. District two i. District three.I.District four.I.District five. I. District six.I.District seven. I. District eight.I.District nine. Motion carries.Okay. Thank you. That concludes the meeting.

Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nOcean carries.18.Adam, 18, is communication from Council Member Pearce recommendations received via a presentation from Voice Waves Long Beach on Youth Justice Research.Thank you and good to you. Here is Chan Hobson here. Okay. Okay. So, no, there's there is no comment. Customer reports.Yes. Thank you. We're going to receive and file a presentation from Voice Waves, a youth led journalism and media training program of Youth Leadership Institute, a statewide youth leadership and development nonprofit voice wave partners with Long Beach youth from the ages of 15 to 25, whose goal it is to raise awareness on community issues within our localneighborhoods. Trainings include digital photography, video radio, social media to engage community on important local issues. With this platform, youth are provided a creative outlet to be a vital part of our community. So we've invited them here today to give us a brief presentation, and I am very happy to say I attended their presentation.Oh three, four.Months ago in June and it was a packed house of youth and their families and just felt like the kind of community space that we wanted to make sure we brought up some of the work that they've done.So thank you, guys.Blunt speak on. Yeah.1/2.Oh, sorry. Okay.Do they have their clicker?Okay.Okay. How do we use this? How exactly do we use this? Sorry, I just want to. Okay, cool. Hi. My name is Carlos. This is Michael Lozano. As the councilwoman said, we're representing voice lives and Youth Leadership Institute.And we're here to talk about some of the findings that we got from data we collected as a part of the My Brother's Keeper initiative. Here we go. So the My Brother's Keeper initiative was launched in 2014 to address opportunity gaps faced by young males of color and with the support of the Long Beach Department of Healthand Human Services. Youth from Voice Waves and Youth Leadership Institute created a survey and a short form documentary to highlight how these issues exist today on the local level. And so we started this process in February and finished it up in June.And during that time, what you see on the screen where some of the headlines kind of just detailing some of the events that were happening at the time, that kind of. Expose youth to getting involved with the criminal justice system.And throughout the process, we also recorded a podcast featuring a discussion about preventing youth from getting involved with the justice system. This featured community experts such as members of Black Lives Matter. And like our documentary, this can be found on the voiceless website.Voice leads dot org, not dot.com. So our survey, we received a total of 197 responses from youth in Long Beach, and the survey was crafted by the youth involved in the My Brother's Keeper project under the Supervision of Wildlife staff.Our goal with the survey was learn more about the mental health needs of youth both before and during their involvement with the justice system. And as you can see above, a lot of our youth that were surveyed reported being between the ages of 14 and 18.Some were older than that. And they also reported mostly not having a job or being part time workers. And being on free and reduced lunch. Questions about. Give me a second. So questions about gender and about race are both left open ended.As you can see, gender there was a pretty even split with people identifying as male and female, almost 5050. And then with race, the majority of our responders were Hispanic or Latino. But I think there's a pretty good mix that represents the diversity of our city.Most of the world, not most say a lot of the youth. Have had their lives impacted by the criminal justice system. Either they themselves have been involved personally or they know someone who has a lot of their involvement involved, having been interacting with school officials or law enforcement.And we. Sorry about that. Among one of the most startling findings that we got from the survey is that 63% of the youth participants had experienced what they described as extreme stress or trauma in some frequency, with 31% of those youths saying that they experiencing it daily or weekly.And survey participants were also asked to describe how they cope with trauma and other negative emotions. On the screen, you'll see the most popular responses to that question. And for the rest of the presentation, I'm going to turn it over to Michael.Yeah.Cool. Thanks, Carlos. So just to reiterate what Carlos was saying, it's clear that some youth in Long Beach, many youth, too many youth face a high frequency of trauma and intense stress in their weekly or daily lives. That's self-reported by the youth and lobbyist themselves.So given the stress, given the negative life events that occur in their lives, we have to ask the question like, where should youth go to find that release? And so the five most common coping mechanisms that youth reported.Number one was sleep. Number two was talking to friends. And the third most common coping mechanism was creative arts and music. If we notice actually as we engage in this conversation, we're going to realize how important it is to talk to your friends, that this idea of talking, this idea of socialization among young people is really important, especially when we talk about how young people cope with negative, negative emotions such as anger, sadness, anxiety or stress in their lives. So talking to friends is going to be an important factor for the following reasons. A separate question asked youth of all these different coping mechanisms that you rely on, which coping mechanism do you believe isthe most effective? So by and large, you said that talking is the most effective way to deal with stress and trauma. Here's the problem, though. Only 17% of you said that they could talk to their parents or family about their negative emotions.There are negative life events or traumas. Only 9% said they could talk to a trusted community member. What about talking to a teacher or counselor? Only 2% of youth said they could do that. 2% out of 197 students.Young people are youth in Long Beach. We talked about what coping methods are most common and which are most effective in reducing stress and trauma. Now we're talking about frequency. Well, talk is important. So how often do youth get to actually talk about their emotions to other people?Unfortunately, we did have to find that one in three youth never talked to anyone about their emotions. Excuse me 1/2. Another 25%. Express themselves to others only every few months. Or a few times a year. Adding on to that, there's a lot of youth who say that there's not many places for them to go for help.Not many people to rely on for support. Given the issues, we actually didn't want one to just rely on like the trauma or focus on that, focus on the problems. We also wanted to focus on solutions. So these are some youth led solutions that the respondents came up with.We asked them, you know, on a scale from 1 to 4, what do you feel are the most effective resources in preventing youth from becoming justice involved? Number one, by far, having a supportive family. Number two athletics. Number three, access to jobs for youth.Number four, music, art and creative media programs. And there's a few other factors up there. That's the top ten, top ten ways that these respondents feel they could be prevented from getting involved in the justice system. The least effective methods.Youth probation. Youth prisons in school detention. Again, focusing on solutions, focusing on the future of limited youth. We thought it was important to come up with three recommendations given this important data that we came across. Increasing restorative justice resources and program visibility across Long Beach.What this what this does, it shifts our solutions, our way of thinking from punitive to conversations, which you said themselves. Conversations and talking is the key to healing is the key to prevention. And we also to a turn youth that are disengaged, that maybe don't find many resources across their community.They become engaged in the community by via restorative justice, via community programs. Recommendation number two, increasing mental health opportunities in schools for both students and their families. Because we saw such a low rate of students being able to talk to their families about their negative emotions.We think it's important to do family counseling in schools.And we have just about 50 seconds left just on the timer.Absolutely. Got you. What this does is shift silence youth from silence to conversation. And recommendation number three, we recommend supporting policy efforts at the local level, at local level that dismantle the school to prison pipeline that shifts our policies from punitive to preventative.For the sake of time. We could we could skip this. But if anyone is interested in a trilingual documentary featuring Long Beach youth and experts on these very issues, go to Tony. You are welcome. Youth Justice Doc. It's in English with subtitles in Spanish and come I made possible with support with the health department here in LongBeach. Thank you.Thank you very much. Councilman ringing.I want to thank you for making this presentation. You presented a lot of ideas there that I think many of us already know but need to reinforce, such as family and detention and probation, aren't real solutions towards dealing with issues that these may be encountering.So thank you for reinforcing that, and I certainly support your efforts. I thank you. And if I can be of any help to you as a mentor or as a person that can share experiences. I grew up in East Los Angeles.This is an example. I was surrounded by many gang members and was even recruited to become one, which I didn't. And my diversion with sports is an example. So thank you for your presentation. Thank you.Pearce Yes.I'll be brief. I just wanted to first take a moment to thank the council members that brought together My Brother's Keeper before I believe Council Member Richardson might have worked on that. So I saw that in the first slide and thought about how much work has been done to get to this point, to get funding for organizationsdoing this great work while its youth center. And I think it's really important that we as a city continue to talk about our youth as our constituents, and make sure that we as adults are talking about trauma and understanding that it is really hard for kids to talk to us as adults, as leaders in our community, asparents. And so anything we can do to partner with these guys more to talk about trauma informed practices, to talk about restorative justice, I think it's a great opportunity. So thanks for bringing.Thank you, Katherine Richardson.Thanks. I just wanted to just chime in and thank you both for coming out with the presentation. Look forward to talking with you and taking a deeper dove here. You know, you your organization and organizations like yours were the ones who were lifting up and talking about this work well before My Brother's Keeper.My Brother's Keeper came because there was a lot of focus from the White House, from the top that said, hey, we want to focus on this population. And now the leadership of the White House has changed. The national dialog has completely changed.And we're getting back to a lot of the rhetoric and the context that was had that happened prior to then. And what do we see? We see the same organizations that were here before carrying this message are the ones who are here now carrying this message.So I think it's important that while sort of our national discourse has changed, we continue to support the local organizations who are continuing to change the narratives around the circumstances and the lives of people who who, you know, boys and young men of color.So so thank you so much. I look forward to talking to you soon.Thank you. There's a motion and a second. Please cast your votes.Councilmember Richardson. Motion carries.\nReasoning:Reasoning:",

Properties located in Council District one Councilwoman Sandoval's district in the West Colfax neighborhood.The site is approximately 1.11 acres and concurrently contains several one and two storey single and two unit residential buildings. The proposed rezoning to Yurek three allows for residential mixed use development and the applicant intends to propose multi-unit residential development on the site.Existing land use on the subject properties a single unit and two unit residential. Surrounding area includes mix of park single and two unit residential as well as some multi unit residential land uses. This was before the planning board in early June.Planning Board unanimously recommended approval of the rezoning. We've gotten one R.A. comment letter from the Sloan's Lake Citizens Group and five public comment letters from members of the public. Four letters in support and one letter of opposition. Wanted to note briefly the previous action that had taken place on these parcels.There was a previous rezoning effort in 2019 to rezone the properties to UMC and UMC. Three Planning Board at that time voted five zero to recommend approval of that application and City Council voted to deny it 10 to 2 at a public hearing held on nine 1619.I will note that this is a completely new application with a completely new set of applicants and a completely new zoned district being requested. However, I thought that the previous action might be useful context. Existing zoning is U.S. C-2, which is a single unit zoned district that also allows detached ADAS as well as tandem houses and duplexeson certain corner lots as well as the U, r, h3a, which is a real house district. Just adjacent zoning. We have some OSA to the north and Flynn's like park you are H-3 also to the south U.S. two and you are H-3 to the east and across here at End Boulevard in Edgewater and Lakewood.There some are two or three and RMF something. Here's an aerial of the site for existing context of the building forming scale. Review criteria. Start with consistency of adopted plans. The proposed rezoning is consistent with a number of COP Plan 2040 goals as elaborated on in the staff report.Blueprint. Denver The future neighborhood context is urban, which is categorized by small multi-unit, residential and mixed use areas embedded in one and two unit residential areas and low scale multi-unit buildings are generally appropriate in this context. Looking at our future place type is a residential low medium, which sees a mix of low to mid scale multi-unit residentialinterspersed in single and two unit residential areas and building heights are three stories or less generally. Sheridan Boulevard is a mixed use arterial. 17th is a residential collector and any place to the south is a local or un designated street.Future growth strategy is all other areas of the city. Looking at the West Colfax plan. The land use concept for these parcels is the main street a scale of 2 to 5 storeys as appropriate. Creating a comfortable pedestrian environment is a stated goal of the plan, and a linear orientation to the street is also a stated goalof this type of land use concept. The Framework plan land use recommendations from the West Coal Flex Plan include supporting infill development as well as promoting a range of housing types and end costs at higher densities in strategic locations, including Main Streets, which as on the previous slide, this falls into.The District plan as part of the West Conflicts plan. This is again a main street, specifically the pig and whistle district. With recommendations to rezone to Main Street two and three. Those are old code districts that would translate to EMS five and eight in the current Denver zoning code.Staff finds the application consistent with criteria two and three. Justifying circumstance. The applicant cites change or changing conditions in the neighborhood and cites a few, few specific examples. And staff concurs that the change in changing conditions is an appropriate justifying circumstance.The application is also consistent with the neighborhood context zone, district purpose and intent. And CPD recommends that Council approve application 20 00168 based on finding or review criteria have been met. Staff is available for questions and we also have the applicant here in person.All right. Thank you, James, for the presentation this evening. We have one individual signed up to speak this evening and it's Jesse Perez. And so we're going to go ahead and try to bring Jesse into the queue to speak again.And if for some reason, Jesse, we're not able to hear you, we're going to ask you to log off and log back in, but we're going to go ahead and try it before we ask you. Okay. Good deal.I think we've got you in. Jesse, go ahead and please begin.Yes. Good evening. Members of council, those watching at home when I was just in Paris and I'm representing four black star Exxon Mobil for self-defense positive action for my face also signs as well as the unity party of Colorado and for a long black nose.And I'll be the next mayor in 2023. I'm in favor of this rezoning tonight. I just had a few questions. I wanted to know if there had been a study done, a neighborhood study done. Uh, also, what would the army level be for the housing at this location?From mixed use to residential well with the house in before this. Am I level B for this? And also, if there was a traffic study done this summer to answer those three questions, either the occupant or members of council, I would greatly appreciate it.Thank you.All right. Thank you, Jesse. That concludes our speakers this evening. Questions from members of Council on Council Bill 659. All right. Seen no questions by members of council this evening. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 659.Council Member Sandoval.Thank you, Madam President. Um, this application before you today, this property was heard a while ago in front of us and voted down and the new owners have done extensive outreach into the community. And I just want to note that the height increase is pretty much it's not that big.The adjacent property to the south, that's where we got the height increase for this property. And one other note to talk about is that along Sheridan I do not have sidewalks on 17th and Sheridan it is a pedestrian path and this redevelopment will allow for sidewalks on Sheridan Boulevard.They are dedicating 16 feet of right away the entire length of the property, the block for a tree line and dedicated sidewalks. I ask my colleagues to support this. Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval. And we are. Working on. I know that we had Councilmember Ortega. She had her hand raised. And so we're I'm getting some direction from our legal counsel. I'm going to go ahead and gavel back in and open the public hearing back up.And so we're going to do that so that we can include questions by Councilmember Ortega. All right. We have reopened the public hearing for Council Bill 659. Councilmember Ortega, please go ahead with your questions. Thank you, Madam President.I had lost audio there for a minute. I couldn't hear what was being said, but my questions for specific to the consolidation of the land or the assemblage of I.Am.Just trying to get an idea of how many units can now be built on that site, because that then raises some questions about whether the ingress and egress will be offered Sheridan or whether it's going to be off a 17th Street or maybe even 16th, because both Sheridan and 17th are busy streets.And it depends on whether you can take a left in from 17 to the site or, you know, just how that's going to work. I think it's going to be really important. It may be that the applicant is just looking to rezone for right now and doesn't have any immediate plans to move forward with the construction.But I think just understanding some of that will be really important to ensuring that we don't have accidents along that corridor. That is one of the streets that previous council members from this district have tried to ensure that we've got sidewalks along Sheridan Boulevard because there aren't any and we have a bus stop.And oftentimes you see people with strollers trying to walk their kids on a slanted dirt area that is very unsafe. This is the next block over. But all all of those factors just kind of come into play, particularly with this block as well.So I wanted to just ask those questions. I think maybe some of that can be addressed by our city staff from CPD, but maybe the applicant as well. All right. Thank you, Councilmember Ortega. We're going to go ahead and start out with James and then I believe we have the applicant here.So we'll just ask you to introduce yourself as well. But go ahead, James.Thank you for the questions. Councilman Ortega. Generally, we wouldn't get into site development plans at the rezoning stage. All of the, you know, requirements for egress and ingress have, you know, have to meet our standards and be built to our code provisions.However, I do believe the applicants have submitted in step already in anticipation of this rezoning. So I will defer to the applicant if he'd like to answer some of your specific questions, because I think there are specific answers in this case.Thank you. Hi. Thank you. Consul Mac Yardeni with us.Architecture 4164 Irving Street. Thank you for taking the time tonight to review this.We have, as Amanda stated.Reached out to the neighborhood pretty extensively to understand concerns, desires and mitigate as many of the impacts of the development as we go forward. As stated, we have already submitted our concept step. We wanted to understand further with Dottie and transportation as well.As access points.Throughout the site. We are going to have those meetings here later on Wednesday and we'll have better understandings. We have not performed any traffic studies at this time. However, we have had conversations with both CDOT and transportation about the upcoming improvements that are going to occur along both Sheridan and 17th, trying to make sure that we workwith.The affected ingress and egress for the site to the question of total number.Of units under the new zoning, we have currently planned for 60 units and looking at parking that at a 0.75.8 ratio to mitigate any off site parking. The price point that we have tried.To.Identify going back to the previous question has really been to build a smaller product to fill in that missing metal by not building that concrete podium and keeping it a surface parking, we're able to build these.At a.Lower cost and therefore offer them to the community at a lower cost. Those numbers are still to be determined as we go through the construction process. And then, as Amanda stated, reconstruction of the entire length of Sheridan Boulevard with a future eight foot tree line and an eight foot sidewalk that is multi-modal, serving that connection between theColfax corridor and the park, really trying to create that gateway for Denver. Any other questions?All right. Thank you. We're going to go ahead, Councilwoman. Take care of your fist. A follow up, clarifying question on whether or not that was intended to be a for sale product or a rental project.It's currently in the for sale or sorry for rent.Or rent a rental car. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you, Madam Chair. All right. Great. Thank you. And thank you, Councilmember Ortega. And seeing that, we wrapped up the questions by members of council. The public hearing is closed and we've had comments by Councilmember Sandoval.I want to give it a moment if there's any additional comments by members of council. CNN. I'll go ahead and chime in that I do believe this meets the rezoning criteria and will be supporting it this evening as well.Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 659.Sandoval. I swear, I. Torres I. Black I. Flynn.I.Hynes. Hi Cashman. I can each.I.Take it. Madam President.I.

Please read the next agenda item.Agenda item 25 Resolution 318 39 Making a preliminary decision on the University of Washington 2018. Seattle Campus Master Plans Committee recommends the resolution be adopted as amended.Katherine Johnson Okay, this one I've got a lot of words about. So the Resolution 31839 contains a preliminary decision on the University of Washington master plan. As a refresher, we are at a one spot in a lengthy timeline here for approval of the major institution master plan.It started with the University of Washington preparing a draft master plan, an environmental impact statement for community input. Then they submitted a final version of those two documents. The City University Advisory Committee then produces comments and a report associated with it.The FBI has the Department of Construction and Inspections issued its own recommendations. The hearings examiner then held a hearing and recommended approval with conditions. All of that happened before we then as a committee had a hearing from the that included the University of Washington, the Department of Construction and Inspections, the Community Advisory Committee, and the parties ofrecord that appealed the decision of those hearings. Examiner. After all of that public hearing, we then took a look at different conditions. We adopted 13 amendments to the plan last Wednesday, as follows Those amendments require the University of Washington to provide 300 units of affordable housing 80% ami on top of the 150 units that are conditioned bythe hearings. Examiner. The other opposes this condition and argues the city lacks the authority to require housing, but has voluntarily agreed to 150 units. We asked for a reduction of the service goal rate from 15% to 12% in 2028, with interim goals tied to the opening of light rail stations.We included parking associated with residence halls and a cap on parking spaces and removed minimum parking requirements from residence halls with lowered the parking cap from 12,300 spaces to 9000 spaces, which was a part of incredibly wonderful, esoteric conversation about how you can cap something in 9000 spaces when there are already exists more than 1000 spaces.We included showers and other park bike parking facilities as part of the the draft recommendations. Trail widening and pedestrians operations along the Gilman Trail as development occurs along the trail. We exempted child care space. On the gross floor area cap maintain the current zone height limit on W 22 supported the use of priority hire and contracting exemptedspace for small businesses from the gross gross floor area. Cap. Encourage the incorporation of diversity in retail ownership on campus. Encourage the use of best management practices for reducing stormwater runoff and ask the University of Washington to negotiate an updated City University agreement.Should my colleagues agree that this monumental amount of work is acceptable to them and we pass this resolution today? The resolution then goes to the parties of record for a 30 day comment period, followed by 14 days of replies.Those parties of record include the Department of Construction and Inspections, the University Board of Regents, as well as all of the individuals and organizations that appealed to parties of record in front of the hearings. Examiners. The those bodies all get to make comments on our resolution.And then in December, we will discuss any comments that we've received and discuss whether or not we would like to pass an ordinance that reflects any changes based on the comments that we've received. Likely sometime after the first of the year.Please remember that this is a quasi judicial matter. So the appearance of fairness rules apply and the council rules related to experts. The community location continue to apply even after we passed the resolution today. But just because we are here doesn't mean that we're at the end, that there's more work to come.And at this point, why don't I pause? Because that was a good five straight minutes of opening remarks.Thank you, Katherine Johnson. The floor is open for remarks on the resolution dealing with the master plan. Councilmember Herbold and looks like I would.Say make it really, really short. Specifically, as it relates to the recommendations from the University District Alliance for Equity and Livability, one of the parties of record on at least at least two of the elements that Chair Johnson reviewed, specifically the elements related to small businesses and the element related to the need to address child care withinthe context of the master plan. We made some proposals for a strategies that were really not there aligned in the goals but not aligned in the methods as was recommended by by the alliance and and cookout. So I'm really eager to get to this next stage of the process so we can actually hear in a way that'sconsistent with the quasi judicial process, whether or not those are good approaches to address those needs, because I really have no idea.Very good. Any other comments before we vote on the resolution or concern? Just good. Closes out comes from Brian.Just say briefly thanks, Councilmember Johnson for all your work on this. Obviously a lot of staff support. I really appreciate this western's help on that, too. There's still a few months of work to go here, but it's a good benchmark I think we're clearing here.Very complex and important stuff working through. And really, I'm pleased to support this resolution and hopefully some version similar in the ordinance in a few months.There between his work on the convention center and then straight from the convention center here and to the major institution master plan list. Woodson has been a busy dude the last couple months. I'd like to briefly say thanks to no on from my office who's helped shepherd a lot of this stuff across the finish line.And, you know, we've had a lot of incredible conversations about the university district over the last couple of years between implementation of the mandatory housing affordability program that neighborhood design guidelines will get next year.

Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThank you, Councilman Shepard, who's been moved and second accountable six approves the zoning map amendment. The Council is required by law to conduct hearings on zoning map. Amendments in the Council's actions are subject to court review in order to provide a record for court review.Testimony is recorded and any items presented to the Council are marked as exhibits and become a part of the record. And Speaker should begin the remarks by telling the council the names and sizes of residents and then they feel comfortable doing so.Their home addresses. A public hearing for council Bill six is now open. May we have the staff report?Thank you, Mr. President. Good evening. Members of Council. My name is Steven Chester, senior city planner with Community Planning and Development. Here's Brant present the staff report for 2600 South Emergency Boulevard map a rezoning map amendment from OCA to GMU five subject site is located within Southeast Denver in Council District six within the University Park neighborhood.The subject site is located at the intersection of University Boulevard Investor Avenue, directly adjacent to Harvard Gulch. Now, rather than kind of hiding the the the punch line to this free zone, I'm just going to kind of outline some of the unique history with this case.Prior to 2010, the subject site was zoned r two. It's due to the fact that we did not have a zone district for our open space. In the old code. It's been used as surface parking for the neighboring multifamily project since around the 1960s.The city sold the land to the current land owner back in 2005. During the citywide rezoning in 2010, it was incorrectly rezone to OSA, which is the zone district for city owned and maintained open space due to a mistake of fact.Pretty much in 2010, the data that CPD used during the citywide rezoning was incorrectly identified. This land is still owned and maintained by the city, thus the need for this rezoning. So more details about the site. It's about 4000 square feet.It's currently vacant use as surface parking. As mentioned before, the property owners are requesting rezoning to bring the parcel into conformance with the adjacent parcel. The city is then take it upon ourselves to be the applicant for this rezoning in order to correct the mistake that was caused in 2010.Thus, the manager of CPD is the applicant for this rezoning. The requested zone district is the general urban neighborhood context the mixed use five story max Jamie five quickly walk through the existing context of the site, starting with the zoning along University Boulevard, primarily the general urban and neighborhood context series of heights from 12 to 5 andthree. The surrounding single family zone districts are all ESU X in terms of the surrounding land use along your see below for some high higher density multifamily development. It's high in mid-rise buildings and primarily single family stable residential neighborhoods surrounding the site along with you see here the directly adjacent Harvard Gulch.In terms of the building form and scale, you can see directly to the north that first picture is a 12 storey multifamily building. The second picture is the site directly north of the subject site, which is the one story multifamily project.The third picture is the current condition of the site, and the last picture is the directly adjacent Harvard Gulch. The process to date we received a 9 to 0 recommendation from planning board had a discussion. Neighborhoods and planning committee in here are today at a hearing at City Council.Public outreach has been conducted throughout the process as outlined in the Denver Zoning Code with public notification given of tonight's public hearing. I also received a note from the City Park Community Council. They voted 11 no in favor of this rezoning application.Quickly walk through the review criteria for all of our official MAP amendments, starting with consistency with adopted plans. The adopted plans for this site are the Comprehensive Plan Blueprint. Denver and the Mercy University Park Plan, adopted in 2008 compliant 2000, outlines a number of strategies which support this rezoning application, primarily around the idea of promoting infill developmentwhere appropriate, in order for neighbors to live, work and play within their own neighborhoods. In addition to land use strategies which talk about creating a. High quality urban design along our mixed use corridors and lane user objective to clarify and update Denver's zoning ordinance and related ordinances, regulations and procedures to be consistent with the goals and objectivesof Denver's citywide land use and transportation plan. Moving on to that plan, blueprint Denver at the time. Blueprint Denver was was created. This was still owned and maintained by the city of Denver. So the future land use classification is open space.However, the surrounding context is all single family residential, in which single family homes is the predominant housing type. However, that does not preclude higher density housing from being present in these areas, especially along mixed use and residential arterial streets in which University Boulevard is designated.It is also an area of stability. Areas of stability are used to maintain the existing character of neighborhoods. However, that does not preclude new development and redevelopment in order to prevent stagnation. As I mentioned before, University Boulevard is a residential arterial street.Vesper Avenue is an undesignated local street. Moving on to the University Park plan, there's a number of goals and strategies in this plan which support this rezoning. Specifically within the Urban Design and Land Use Goals section in which the plan identifies this area as a main street urban design district.And in that classification, the typical skills 2 to 5 storeys, up to 8 to 10 storeys in transit, transit rich activity centers and nodes. This is in order to create a healthy neighborhood or healthy neighborhood edges and encouraging dense, compact transit, supportive growth where appropriate.Somebody finds that there is this reasoning is consistent with the camp plan 2000 blueprint Denver and University Park Neighborhood Plan. In addition, the uniformity of district regulations in furthering the health, public, public health, safety and welfare are met due to the implementation of the city's adopted city plans.The justifying circumstances for this rezoning is a mistake of fact. As mentioned before, CBT finds this criterion is met due to the data used during the 2010 citywide rezoning incorrectly identified this parcel as city owned and maintained open space.Lastly, consistency with neighborhood context zoned district purpose and intent. The general urban context is primarily characterized by multi-unit residential uses and a variety of building forms. The proposed rezoning to Jimmy five brings the incorrectly zoned parcel and to closer alignment with the surrounding neighborhood context.CPD finds this criterion is met based on the plan recommendations for this area along with the existing and desired character of this neighborhood. With that, CPD recommends approval based on finding all review criteria have been met.Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chester. We have one speaker this evening, Mr. Texter.Fat tax of 45.35 Julian Street, Denver, Colorado. Members of Council. It was simply wrong for you to give yourselves a pay raise while the camping ban is still in effect and you have not provided for the home as a tax.Denver Mr. Texar, please stay on the topic of the public hearing, please.You made a factual error just as you did in this rezoning ordinance. And worse, you don't have enough respect for the people to submit it to a vote of the people.Thank you, Mr. Texar. So that concludes our speakers. Are there any questions from members of Council?Kathleen Robb Thank you, Mr. President. Well, this is pretty much technical rezoning. I am concerned that we have a blueprint map that shows this is open space from 2000 to 2003. So I worry about the consistency with the cities.Adopt a plan and I return to the question that I ask in committee. Why did Parks sell this? I understand it's been used for parking for a long time, which was on the first slide. But I'm wondering if it's a case of real estate not understanding that the land use concept was park.I want to know if Parks and Rec were advised of the sale and approved of it, and I haven't had a real answer since committee though I have to admit I didn't spend a lot of time following up until a constituent brought it to my attention this afternoon.Excellent question. In terms of Blueprint Denver, we'll be updating that in the near future. So hopefully we'll fix any of these inconsistencies in terms of the kind of reasoning for the sale back in 2005. Greg needs to go from Parks and Rec is here.Maybe you can provide a little more insight into that sale back in 2005 and kind of my search haven't been able to find any sort of official documentation with any sort of reasoning for the for the sale.But okay. I do really appreciate your being here from Parks and Rec.I'm sorry if I mispronouncing last name.Good evening. Greg Nowinski. I'm the park surveyor for the parks, familiar with property records and these types of issues. This was a real estate deal. Parks was not involved in this decision to sell this part of property. Originally, it was acquired as part of the Harvard Gulch drainage area.And as time goes on, these areas were incorporated in the parks maintenance category. So far is being consulted on the sale of it. Parks was not consulted with with this as far as I'm aware. So being city property, this was used as a parking lot by the adjoining property owners real estate saw fit to confirm that useand sell this property to the adjoining property owner. So it's not designated park property. It wasn't acquired to be park property, but it was in parks inventory as part of the Harvard Gulch drainage area.Do you have any idea if Parks and Rec was involved in that Blueprint Denver map that shows it as open space and identifies it? Our minutes from committee says Prior to 2002, the property was owned by the city and parks and the Parks and Rec land use concept was noted as natural open space.It would have been in parks inventory and noted as green or as park.Okay. Thank you.Sure.Thank you. Councilman Rob Carter. I'm going to take it.First, I want to thank Councilwoman Robb for that question, because that then makes me wonder how many other parcels do we have that are next to parks that might be might have been sold off? Or and I know that there's been a great effort in the city to try to wrap our arms around all of the parkland and dedicate officially dedicate it so that it is protected land. So thank you for asking that question. My question is a little different, and it's about the choice of zoning that this is being changed to. And so I'd like to ask if you wouldn't mind coming back up and help us determine how that was decided?Because I had heard you say that originally it was our to land and this is GMU five and there is a difference in density between the GMU five and the older are two zoning. So how was that decided?And is there any I'd have to look back at the map to see if there is any other Jimmu five zoning adjacent to this property.So great question. So the Jimmy five was decided because is the the zoning of the parcel directly adjacent to the site along with the plan recommendation from the University Park Neighborhood Plan in terms of identifying.Pull that up on the map. Sure. Well, we're talking.Um. Yeah, that's probably the best one. So. University Boulevard. It's identified the plan as a in blueprint Denver and in the neighborhood plan as a residential arterial street. And so there's a primarily the general urban context is found at a variety of different densities you see some give you three directly north of the site is Jim U12. And so Jim, you five is the site that's directly adjacent to this parcel. And it was CPI's recommendation that this parcel also be reason to give me five.So when you say adjacent it's actually across the street and beyond an additional property to the is that the north and.The the Jimmy five is directly kind of touching this parcel.Right. And the 12 is across the street.Yes.That's correct.Okay. Yeah, I was just trying to understand that because it didn't seem to make sense that this was next to open space, but yet we were going from an AR two zone to a GM U five. And so the property to I'm not sure is that the east on the right side of the property?Mm hmm. What is the zoning on that?So that would be across the alley between this property and property. Directly to the east is ESU d x. So a single use zoning district, single unit. Excuse me.So that's more in contrast to the old r-1 zoning, is that correct?Typically. But there's some differences.Okay. All right. Those are all the questions I have for right now. Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember. Take it. Councilman Robbie, another question.I do. And thank you for your indulgence on this relatively straightforward rezoning. My question is, I see the bread Buchanan or CPD as the applicant on this, which indicates a technical error that you've found. But do you have any idea how the land will be used in the future?Is the current owner the same person who owns the adjoining GM? U5 Because I know it's addressed for university, it's not really right on university.So the parcel directly to the north is owned, is also owned by this this land owner of this subject site.And is this property necessary for him to to meet his parking requirements?Correct.Okay. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman. Rob, any other questions? What was seen on public hearing is now closed. Time for comment, Councilman Brown.Thank you, Mr. President. There are some things I wish that could be done administratively. Unfortunately, this could not be a yes vote will correct a mistake of fact. Surely we all want to correct a mistake of fact. So let's vote yes.Thank you, Mr. Brown.Thank you, Counsel Brown. Any other comments? Councilwoman Robb.I will be supporting this tonight, but I do want to express my concern about the disconnect which was previous, not current, between real estate and parks, because I think people have become aware of those differences. But this has caused some problems in the past.Parks is very dedicated right now to designating as many parks and making sure there Servais is correct. But my if I voted against this, it wouldn't change the past. And right now it's being used this way. And there certainly is a use by right, I believe there on the property.So I will support this.Thank you, Councilwoman Robb. Councilwoman Ortega.I just want to explain my vote as well. I think the last question that Councilwoman Robb asked about whether this particular property is needed by the adjacent property owner. I think by changing the zoning to a higher density, it affords the opportunity at some point in the future.If that owner wanted to change the what's on the site, they would be able to do something that is much bulkier if they level the building that they have now. But I think in general, the fact that it is being it is needed and is being used and will continue to be used by the adjacent property ownerthat I'm okay allowing that to move forward with the zone change. I would like at some point to see that whenever there is park land that is not dedicated, that is being proposed to be sold, that we are at a minimum informed about it, but should be allowed to vote on it as well.Thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Any other comments on Council Bill six? CNN on. Madam Secretary, roll call.Brown. Hi, Fats. I can eat Lemon Lopez. Hi, Monteiro. Nevitt. Ortega. Rob. Rob, I. Shepherd Sussman. Hi, Brooks.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nMotion carries.At 23, please.Report from Financial Management Recommendation to declare ordinance approving and adopting the official budget of the City of Long Beach for the fiscal year 2018 2019. Creating and establishing the funds of the municipal government of the City of Long Beach and appropriating money to and authorizing expenditures from said funds for said fiscal year, declaring the urgency thereof andproviding that this ordinance shall take effect on October one, 2018. Read and adopt it as read.Any public comment on this? Please come forward. Are you going to address on file? If you recall last week at the suggestion of a generally pretty reliable consultant, I use Homer Simpson. I had to pass it along. The suggestion that we consider putting a framework on top of the Marina Vista.A tennis court, put solar panels there and even suggested a long boathouse lane there would be an opportunity for that. But then Homer got back to me and said he may have been a little over optimistic, although there's still an opportunity.And this is what he suggested we take a look at. What's the key to solar panels? Success is generating enough electricity to offset offset the use of that electricity. Around there. There are currently there's very little use of electricity around Marina Vista Park.However, however, Holmer suggested taking a look at who is paying for the streetlights along there. All right. Who is paying for the little bit of electricity used in the restroom? Who is paying the city for? Who's paying the electric bill?Fire station 14. And the thinking is that if you add those up there, it might be well justified to put in. The solar panel on the top of that framework of the tennis court. Again, somebody's got to be paying the bill at the fire station.Somebody has got to be paying whatever streetlights are there. So let's add somebody that's not me, but somebody that's really good at math. Put a pencil to the figures and see how it works out in a cell. Do what hopefully will be done with the third district counsel's office.Get a new roof and have a new.Roof paid for by the solar paneling of that. Thank you. Thank you. Next item, please. You're not excited. Apologize.All right. Hostile once again. Information on file. Wow. $3 billion budget and it's still not enough. I mean, how much money does the family actually need? Come on, guys. I have six parcel taxes on my house, Mr. Richardson.I don't need a seven. And I don't need an eighth possibly coming from L.A. County on this phony water runoff tax, 2.5 cents per square foot of hard surface. What a joke. And then there's another tax that wants to come down from Sacramento.Yeah, that's really funny. You're laughing. You know, you guys don't pay much attention. It's pretty rude, but that's the. That's your style. So no matter how much money we get, the city has so many more sources of income than most cities.And in the state of California, a port, an airport, their own water, gas. It's amazing. And it's still not enough money. And any time you need more money, you raise it. We pay the highest utility user tax on our utilities.Doesn't seem to bother anybody up here. Nothing bothers you from the state. We you know, you're going to support a gas tax that's putting a real burden on people of lower middle. I mean, extremely low or no income.I mean, people living in their cars that can barely make it or having to pay outrageous prices for gas. And you think that's funny? It's not. It's really tragic. You have these motorhomes that seem barely to run. You know, they're having to pay an exorbitant price for fuel, have a place to live.But, you know, you just keep passing everything that like I said, it's amazing how many times you guys vote no. I'd like to know a percentage. It's got to be less than 1% of the time. And most of this doesn't benefit residents.The city is run by and for public employees, not us. All you want us is to pay more taxes, and you seem to do that. And also, one thing I would like to you know, I'm very sorry about, you know, Captain role in his tragic passing.But I also think he should say some words for the other eight or nine or ten fire personnel and residents that perished in the fires in northern California. That was a tragedy also. So I think you should pay homage to all the people that passed away.They were all our heroes, too. So like I say, you know, I've been trying to do this for a lot of years. I'm tired of it. You know, I started out being at 50% on the ballot measures. If I was a baseball player, I'd be making millions.Now I'm hitting to 50. I guess I'm down the ballot almost being cut. Like I said, there's never enough money for the family.Thank you. Next speaker, please.I can't in good conscience recommend a vote approving this budget. I've seen the way you've spent the last year's budget. I've seen the amounts of money that go to pay for elections that we have to have conducted by the county.Because for some reason, the people in the city of Long Beach didn't vote enough or high enough percentage didn't vote. So now the county has to run these elections and we have to pay them to do it for us.We have to pay them to send out the mailers with the pros and the cons. When they get around to it. And a lot of residents didn't get them at all. We have to pay for the lawyers. To get engaged with the people who write the can arguments.They engage outside counsel so that the people writing these arguments. Are already behind the eight ball. They just can't even survive. They're looking at the possibility of having to pay your legal fees if they lose. So they always end up caving whether or not they're offered commissions or not.It's my understanding that the budget includes $250,000 for legal expenses for illegal aliens. I'm not going to debate the merits of that. What I'm going to ask for is $250,000 for the citizens to defend themselves against the city.That I think is more than fair. We are citizens. We're not illegal aliens. We do vote. Those of us who come down here do. The budget. I will not approve because of the already admitted $100,000 that will be spent on informational fliers that will be sent to, as Joe has brought to our attention.Only four or seven of the voters. The state of the animal shelter is appalling. You can groan. The animals are groaning. I'm groaning. I can't stand to listen to this. This is really unbelievable. One veterinarian is what the auditor recommends.One. How much could that cost? A quarter of a million. You know what? If you give me the legal fund, I'll give it back. They can have it for the animal shelter. You need to learn how to spend your money more wisely before you'll get any support from this citizen.Thank you. Next speaker.Hi, Karen. Race side resident of District one.Work in District.Two. I want to commend the City Council for the amazing job that they did on the budget preparation and the community meetings. I don't know where these other people were in, why they don't understand what the budget pays for.It pays for our city services. And all the city employees that I work with and the city council have been very conscientious and spent hours preparing this budget. It's the most fair and equitable budget I've seen from the city in a long time.I think we're moving in a very positive direction, and I want to commend you for the work you did. The only thing that I would like to see is that we start the process earlier so I could not stay and a lot of my friends could not stay till 2 to 3 in the morning.And Stacy, you shouldn't have had to either. We felt for you.So keep up the good work on the budget preparation. And the only thing I would suggest started earlier. And do something so that people can understand. What their taxes paid for. Because the roads, the sewer, the water. That's what our taxes paid for.And I think the city does a fine job of doing those services.Thank you very much. Thank you. No, no.I want to thank the previous speaker for raising an issue that the previous two speakers. Exactly why do citizens not trust your budgets? It's because one of the reasons is that the budget doesn't really tell you what services you're getting.It says instead what departments are going to get, how much money. It doesn't say anything about, in quantitative comparative terms, how the departments are performing. And the more information technology is out there, the less relevant information. Over the past few years, the city has provided to residents on the website to be able to see how much iseach dollar getting. In the way of each kind of service. So you, the residents can't compare and you cannot even make reasonable tradeoffs as to should we have, for example, more people in public works doing tree work as versus street sweeping.So that is a real problem. The. Previous speaker. Praised your efforts to try to understand from this budget what's actually going on. But the problem is that we're not there. The budget does not tell you. Another reason, though, that people do not trust your spending relates to the unfortunate incident event that we are commemorating today.911. If you recall what you actually saw on TV screens, it wasn't terrorists. It was planes. It was planes crashing into an iconic building. It was a display of.All.That was wrong with mid-20th century corporate vanity. The notion that you take clerical and information workers and stuffed them all together in a vulnerable, congested, high cost, high energy consuming central building. The lesson of 911 was that we were able to survive the loss of all those information workers because we had distributed networking, and that was alreadyback in 2001. Things are much better than that now. Was this lesson applied for the housing of Long Beach City employees? Absolutely not. The thought was we just got to have another central tower, demolish this one and put up another one.When we learn the lessons of history and budget accordingly, people may have a little better confidence in your decisions.Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. I mean, what public figures.I should thank you both, Mayor. I just wanted to thank the many, many, many, many members of the community who came out to community budget meetings, who also came down to City Hall for budget oversight committee meetings. I want to thank my two colleagues on budget oversight.I know we had a lot of tough decisions to make, and I really appreciate all the work that went into knowing and understanding what that 500 pages entailed and the details of it over weeks and weeks. And then for our students that are here today.We're always open to any feedback that you have. Our budget is completely online, as are our expenditures on an annual basis, and so they make for great class projects. I know back when I was a grad student in oh five.I used city budgets and if there's any other questions I can answer for you. I'm always happy to do so. So I urge my colleagues support of this important item to pass a.$3 billion budget with a B.Thank you very much. Would you please cast your vote?\nReasoning:Reasoning:",

Now we'll move forward with item 19, please.Communication from Councilwoman Allen Councilman's and Diaz. Vice Mayor Richardson Recommendation to request city manager to work with the Health and Human Services Department to provide an overview of the food safety program, education and enforcement at food facilities.Thank you, Councilwoman Allen.Yes, thank you, Vice Mayor. I brought this item in response to some concerns that I have heard raised by restaurant owners in my district and which I know they have also been echoed elsewhere in the city. There are 2200 operators in our city and that's a huge number.These operators are small business owners, families, community partners. They are also donors who support youth sports leagues, neighborhood associations and their innovations in food and their continued presence in Long Beach are helping drive the city's economic and the tourism resurgence.Over the past two years, restaurants and caterers in Long Beach and across this country has suffered challenge after challenge. And it's become apparent that there is a disconnect here. So I would like us as a council to ask the health department to update us on their processes, especially with sidewalk vending and food truck regulatory processes starting.We must reassure the brick and mortar operators that fairness is is top of mind. We also ensure that fairness is the starting point for inspections and for regulations for both brick and mortar and for the mobile food facilities.Thank you.Thank you. Councilwoman Sara.Yes. I just want to add my support to this item. This is a great item, Councilwoman Allen, and thank you for council members and Dana and vice mayor for signing on. I just want to reiterate how important it is to make sure there is clarity around the education and process, as we do want to consider how we'redoing and ensuring everyone has the appropriate information to do business because that's really what we want to make sure we do, is ensure our businesses are successful, that they're not limited or hindered by some of these process if we are able to make them available and clear, especially for our sidewalk vendors as we're going to be movingthrough with our state legislation process and other ways that we're going to try to make sure we support their business as well as our brick and mortar. So just support this item. Great item.Thank you, Councilwoman Zendaya's.Thank you and thank you to Councilwoman Allen for bringing up this very, very important item. I think it's very important that we really look at how we can help our brick and mortar businesses that that are serving food.I think that in the last few years, it has been really hard, and that's only an understatement. And if you're a business owner out there, a restaurant in this town there, you know that that is very true. And one of the things that I think is important is for all of us to be on the same pageand understand that there's certain things, certain processes that that our brick and mortar businesses have to go through. And with those processes can be then one of the things that's very important to me and why I support this item very much is that a lot of those fees sometimes hurt our businesses instead of helping them.And one of the things that we really want to do is be able to help these businesses, especially because if they thrive, all of our communities thrive. So very, very happy to support this side of things. Councilwoman.Thank you.

Please line up at the podium there. Any members of the public that would like to speak on item 19 in Zoom, please use the raise hand feature or dial star nine.No. In person.You know, I'm going to have to give Mr. Supernova's props, because I think that that nine one vote sorry, eight one vote that we had the other day was prophetic. We're going to have issues. City of Los Angeles is already starting to hunker down on the health and sanitary conditions of a lot of the vendors.It doesn't really make sense. I pay for a city license, a business license. I operate a storefront. I don't think it's fair for a lot of us in terms of preparation. What we have to deal with in comparison to the lack of those type of standards being applicable to people just because they're outside.I think that I want to be fair and courteous to the communities that those come from. But, you know, speaking from personal experience, you know, my grandmother almost died from a E.coli experience that she had with a sidewalk vendor.And so it's not to say or to cast that a shadow or a cloud on everyone. But, you know, I know if there's no operator health person going to every single thousands of people who are operating throughout the city and inspecting if they have a side thing or, you know, if they're up to standard.So there needs to be some type of byline that we can all bridge about because when liability is concern, I'm sure the city knows that it always lands in the lap of, you know, the general fund. So hopefully we can come to some agreement about what sanitation looks like for food preparation.And you know what? What's the future to be? Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember Cipriano.As long as Mr. Can for a reference meeting, I thought I should go ahead and speak. I know we have staff here, so if I could ask a question about health inspections now. It's my understanding that the health guidelines are established at the state level.If there's that if there's a training component locally, would that not have to be state driven? And if there's not an answer for that because you haven't looked into this yet, I completely accept that. But to my way of thinking, I didn't understand how a local health official who is burdened with making inspections would have the timeor the authority to train individual operators in restaurants.Good afternoon, counsel. I'm from. My name is Morgan Warfield. I am with the Environmental, Health, Health and Human Services. I'm the operations officer. Thank you for having me here. The training does come from the state, either from California, Department of Health or sometimes from FDA.We have a standardization that is overseen by FDA. We also provide training every time that we have interaction with our food establishments, either it's from the owner or from the manager or any of the employees within the establishment.Okay. Thank you for that. And that's my understanding that what training comes about, then it's incumbent on the operator of the restaurant to go ahead and train staff. So based on that and the fact that I have not received any complaints from restaurant tours, that I will not be in support.Thank you.Thank you. There is a motion and a second. Members, please go and cast your votes.District one.Oh, I'm sorry. We actually need to do roll call. We have two folks that are virtual. So remarkable.District one. Right. District two i.

Resolution 32018 Support Secretary Deb Hollins Truth and Healing Commission Regarding Indian Boarding Schools. This Commission would study and address ongoing impacts of the 1819 Civilization Fund Act.This federal policy passed by our Congress established Indian boarding schools for the sole purpose to forcibly remove American, Indian and Alaska Native children from their families to assimilate into white settlements. The Commission would lead investigative efforts of past, present and U.S. boarding schools, as well as identify services to respond to intergenerational trauma that families continue to faceto this present day. The law states through education, therefore forced the removal, cultural genocide and emotional physical abuse of native children was protected under federal law. Back in 2019, then Congresswoman Haaland and Senator Warren introduced legislation to create a Truth and Healing Commission that addresses present day impacts of the 1819 Indian boarding school policy that forcibly removedNative American children from their families in order to assimilate them as what is now deemed a civilized society. Senator Warren and now Secretary, I'm sorry, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland continue to fight for this legislation as we all do.Research and advocacy on this topic is led by the Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition, and our office have been working closely with them, as well as local tribes there. These are national leaders, organizations, tribal governments and policy folks behind this federal legislation to support ongoing efforts at the federal level.I have with me today a resolution that outlines specific measures of the Truth and Healing Commission that the city must support. We hope that the city will support any knowledge. Today, the commission will investigate boarding schools across the country and address the intergenerational trauma that forced removal that the forced removal has had on indigenous balance to thisday, as I shared with you all this morning as well, last week, the mayor's office informed us that their intent is to support this legislation and sign this resolution.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nBill passed and the chair of the Senate. Just one sec here. Okay, let's move to committee reports. Please read the first agenda item.The report of the Governance, Equity and Technology Committee Agenda Item one Council Bill 119 427 relating to the regulation of the for hire industry, removing certain considerations between an exclusive driver representative, representative and the Director of Finance, Administrative Services and many sections 6.3 10.7 35 for code and repealing rules and regulations to the extent they are inconsistentwith this ordinance. Committee recommends the bill passed.Thank you very much. I'll say a few opening words about what this bill is doing and then certainly turn it over to Councilman O'Brien, who shown your strong leadership in this area. So our goal in this legislation has always been to put the city of Seattle in the best position to address the issue of what we considerfair compensation to all TNC taxing for hire drivers without compromising the ability of these companies themselves to thrive in a competitive marketplace. In light of ongoing litigation, we are amending ordinance 124968, which provides council with most flexibility and options directly and efficiently to address the issue of driver compensation.The ordinance we passed in 2015, as many of you know, have been has been tied up in court. And our introduction of this bill, 119427, we think is common sensibly allows us to look at all options on the table regarding driver compensation without any more additional litigation delays.Again, just by way of background, in December 2015, you may recall that we passed an ordinance again under Councilmember Bryant's leadership and many of us looking at these issues relating to the regulation of the transportation and for hire industry and under which for hire drivers could determine whether or not to engage in collective negotiations over various termswith companies who contract with those drivers, examples being Uber, Lyft and and taxi companies. And among other things, the ordinance that we did pass elicited certain subjects to be collectively negotiated, including best practices relative to vehicle equipment standards, safe driving practices, criminal background checks, the nature and amount of payments made to or withheld from drivers hours andconditions of work, etc.. So I was one of the many council members who supported this. And again, the legislation today are just removing as a sub subject of bargaining the nature and amount of payments received by or withheld from drivers.There's a few other technical corrections, but nothing substantive in nature. So that's what we hope to do today. And Councilmember O'Brien, I hope I left you something to say with there. I'll turn it over to you.Council President, you did a great job of summarizing that. So you didn't leave me much to say, but I appreciate your support and strong words for this. I also support this legislation and I'll just reiterate that, that by taking this action, we still, as a body, reserve the right to to set fares and standards like we dofor other parts of the industry. There's no plan at the moment to do that, but it's something that we might consider going in the future. But again, as you said, just to reiterate, this still leaves most of the terms of employment or work, I should say, for these independent contractors to be subject to the collective bargaining agreement. It just takes this one item out, as you mentioned.Very good. Any comments? I mean, our colleagues and I'll just say sort of in closing that as many of these TNC companies sort of struggle or are in many cities throughout this country and actually across the world with what a regulatory.Framework looks like. I'm really optimistic that we can figure this out in Seattle. What's fair to both the drivers, those, whether the part time or full time and to the companies themselves to allow competitive choices that we could figure out what a healthy regulatory scheme looks like here.And and again, maybe other cities in this country could sort of follow our lead. And that's the work we're going to do this year. And I look forward to it. So.Can I just ask question about the schedule? What do you anticipate and when do you think we would have something for review?Yeah, I know I should have talked that much and I was going to keep the question. I'm optimistic that first quarter this year we'll be firing up the committee and looking at these issues. We're still struggling with some issues on how to get some of the data that we want and the executives on board also assisting us, trying to get data on the types of rides and the number of rides in certain areas of the city, because there are other issues in addition to the composition of the drivers that we're concerned about with how our streets look.So but I anticipate first quarter of this year, we'll be doing some work on it. Okay. Having said that, please call the role on the passage of the bill.Make sure. Johnson Whereas O'Brien President Harrell five in favor nine opposed the.Bill passed and show sign it please read the next agenda item.The report on the Sustainability and Transportation Committee Agenda Item to cancel 119 415 relating to city streets.

Next up.Is item 24.Communication on Parks, Recreation and Marine Recommendation. Enter into agreements with as a landscape and park would landscape maintenance for grounds maintenance services and a total amount of 5,185,259 citywide.I think Councilman Mongo, you want to share with us.A short report.Yes.Hello, Tim. What can we do? A short report? Yes, sir. Good evening, honorable mayor, vice mayor.And members of the city.Council. I. I just finished my second month here, and one of the things that I have been doing is going to the different park sites. And I in a recent visit to recreation park, I bumped into Clemente, who is part of the ground maintenance team, and he was using an iPad.I was so impressed with Hurley and Kelly's team will be doing a very brief presentation on the landscape contract, the iPad tool, as a way to monitor our landscape contracts, to keep our park system.Green and clean.The other thing that I noticed that the team is so nimble, very flexible, they keep on anticipating problems. One of the issues that you may have heard about is Roundup with regards to being on the list of problem, Proposition 65, as well as a recent some some news with regards to a court ruling.And because of that and the quick thinking from Kelly Parkins and Hurley Owens, they believe and I concur and I recommend that we're going to be stop using Roundup in the parks and the maintenance contract is, you know, it's not just the parks, it's also the golf courses, the street medians, the landscape around the police, the libraryfacilities. But right now, we're going to stop using Roundup, which is the chemical in question is glyphosate, glyphosate. And until so we can have time to assess.And have.An understanding of the regulations that are being placed on this chemical. So we're going to have to be on the safe side and stop using it in in the parks. Now, let me turn it over to Kelly, who will be presenting the the landscape contract before you get.Good evening. So landscape standards define how landscape standards define how a landscape area is expected to look and function when the work is completed. Their consistent and have documented performance criteria, their line with the department's strategic objectives, they're defined by short and long term expectations.Give consideration to stakeholder use, horticultural function and esthetics and safety. Our landscape contract is our standard. It was written to achieve a satisfactory result across a broad range of landscape types, which include features as diverse as grass, lakes, trees and natural areas.This allows us to have an expectation that our parklands will be clean, safe and esthetically pleasing institutional landscapes, which are different from garden to residential setting and largely defined by horticultural elements such as plants, trees and lakes. But in distilling the landscape contract into maintainable portions, consideration has to include the institutional elements such as walking paths, picnictables and playgrounds, which enhance the public's use of these spaces to simply recite the list of maintain areas which include over 3000 acres, 170 parks and 72 acres of medians, 45 acres of lakes, libraries, health centers, police stations really oversimplifies the unique challenges of what it takes to manage a 34 acre wetland park versus a park with12 athletic fields. The breadth of scope is important, and this contract concisely specifies how these various entities are to be managed. This contract contains all the specifications to adequately manager areas, requires a broad skill set to provide the daily maintenance for a variety of landscapes and the amenities in each.It require sophisticated tracking and training of collected data and staffing to continually assess the data to make field changes. The work of producing a fully revised landscape contract began in the summer of 2016. Nearly a year long process resulted not only in the landscape specification, but the process by which the contract would be bid.In developing the RFP, staff consulted with cities including Riverside, San Francisco, Anaheim, West, Sacramento, Orange and Irvine to name a few. Additionally, the city auditor's part maintenance audit from 2016 clearly identified the need for a performance metric to gauge expectations.Crew defined service levels and the need to develop a worker system to identify deficiencies in mined data for trends and resource planning. The RFP resulted in a contract award based on the findings from a five member panel of staff and an outside consultant, a process which included a preliminary rating candidate interviews, reference checks with other cities, anda final rating. The award used a point system for gauging the candidate's approach experience as well as price to allow us to obtain the best contract. So what's different now? The framework of the current contract provides a landscape period of satisfactory level to the process of evaluating and revising the scope of work.Staff assessed areas where improvement is needed, how they account for a rate performance, as well as a measurement, a guide or a benchmark, if you will, for contract execution. Some of the improvements in the can in the new contract include irrigation.All repairs are to be performed within 12 hours of discovery. The majority of the class will be under central control and directly programed by city irrigation staff. By 2019, athletic fields are being inspected daily fertilize monthly and irrigation repair completed within 4 hours.Early permits permit site preparation 7 p.m. versus 9 a.m. for weekend use specifications for trash. Abandoned items and debris removal are more clearly defined, and the management of this contracts includes weekly park inspections against the prescribed prescription duties prescribed specification using a mobile inspection system.Deficiencies are noted on the work order, which would be utilized for reduction and payment of invoices. The proposed contract is a performance contract in that tasks, inclusion frequencies have to netty clean, safe and esthetically pleasing landscape. The landscape contract consists of the same primary geographical areas but are now managed as six individual entities instead of four areas. One, three four remain the same area. Five consists of Thailand basins which are required require a specified landscape scope and area six. The MTA blue line was formerly merged with an area three so areas one, two and four will be managed by a staggered landscape.There are new in this contract that they have previously managed. That area, areas three, five and six will be managed by park now excuse me, park landscape. This is a new contractor for this section of the city, but they are also they're currently serving the port in the MTA contracts.The fiscal impact. The contract designations with associated costs are listed by area on this table. Total cost is $5.1 million. This is a million more than the previous contract. This award fully finds service levels for all sites, parks, libraries, street landscape, police stations, health centers, lakes, the Rancho Historic Site and natural areas, including El Dorado Nature Centerand the DeForest Wetlands. The increases since the last contract includes 17 new park sites such as Gum Via and Drake Chavez Park enhancements such as the reconstruction of Shattuck Park. There are eight new islands, street islands and medians such as Paramount meetings and six street roundabouts.And there are four new MCU sites such as the Michelle Obama Library and the police station on the east side of the city. Contract Management Site Evaluation and communication of the most important component.Of.Managing a scope of this magnitude. The electronic mobile monitoring system was developed in 2016 with the assistance from Technology and Innovation Department, an operation we employed since 2017. So allows for inspection against all of our sites, against the landscape contract.And if you wouldn't mind just breezing through these next two slides, I think we.Would just this is got to more inspection document has the landscape contract specifications listed ongoing deficiencies resulting in a reduction against the monthly invoice. Thank you.Thank you.So I had a couple of.Yeah, I think, I think we're good in the presentation. Let me let me turn it back over to Councilman Mongo.So I just I just want to tell you that I can see the considerable amount of work that has gone on over the last year. I met with the previous Parks and Rec director probably a dozen times on matters related to this contract specifically.I'm so thankful for the mobile monitoring. I want to give a special thank you to technology and innovation for adding the ability for the community to participate in the maintenance needs of the city by using the Go Long Beach app and how that will integrate completely.I think that it's important for the community to know that there are two or three big things going on in this contract. One is a 20% increase in in total resources being dedicated to park maintenance. That hasn't happened in a really long time.I know that Hurley and his team are doing everything that they can as often as they can. But without increasing this contract, we just would not be able to meet the needs of the additional park space. Not to mention the under service to some of the park space as it is today.Additionally, I really appreciate how much there is in the inspection side for us to be able to hold them accountable. We've had complaints in the past where certain contractors were in violation by either driving their trucks across our fields and breaking sprinklers and or matting down what we had just aerated.And those are the types of frustrating things the community sees that are just not acceptable. I appreciate our new Parks and Rec director kind of mentioning the potential for a pilot program and discussing.Our.Alternatives to some of the poisons that we're using in our parks right now. And maybe if we can identify some areas where we set them aside. But I do want to do it with a full picture in mind.I know there's some council agenda items that are potentially coming forward, some that I've been asked to sign on to and others I'm considering. But I think that when we talk about poisons use in our parks, we have to recognize that the ones we're using now aren't the worst available.And so if we're going to ban one, we need to ban anything worse than that as well. Some of the ones that are considered worse are more expensive, and that's why no one uses them. But should we eliminate some of the options?Park maintenance organizations that have won these contracts might be interested in using them. So for the areas that we know or want to do pilot programs, I'm very supportive and I look forward to an opportunity to discuss and whatever different weed abatement options are available in the future.So thank you for your hard work on this, and I look forward to our continued partnership with our new park advocates in maintaining the parks together in cooperation.Thank you, Vice Mayor Andres.Yes. I mean, I also would like to thank the parks for the hard work you guys have been doing with the city manager or the park director. You know, before we move forward with this, you know, can we look at some of the added signage, you know, in our parks listing the contractors and the phone numbers toreport day to day issues? My office, we see cars on a regular basis reporting problems that need to be, you know, related to the contractors. And I think signs would help residents report problems as they see needed. So this is something I would really like to see because a lot of people just think that we're supposed togo round and pick up everything. But some of those signage might in the phone numbers there could help you guys even with the work that they're doing out there. I think you could have both individuals. Thank you.Thank you, Catherine.I just wanted to say great job. I know that my constituents have been waiting to end Roundup for a while, and I also appreciate the thorough recap of the contracts. I like the idea of signs with phone numbers, though maybe that would decrease all of our energy.Thank you, Council Minister.Thank you very much and thank you for the report. This is good news. Any time we can talk about our park maintenance and and getting new contracts and taking into consideration for all of the new work that we're doing and maintaining maintenance issue.I just wanted to clarify something. I note that this this contract is a little bit more expensive than than before. To the tune of about $1,000,000 more. I want to know, is this the money budgeted in the city manager's budget?The 1.5 million is to take into consideration here. Is that separate from this contract?No, this is totally the. You mean the water? The water. The water is separate. The water is a one time. Okay. This is structurally, structurally budgeted.So great news. This is good. More resources for Parks and Rec to to to make our parks excellent and keep them excellent. No pressure early. Thank you.No pressure taken off.We have a motion and a second. I want to just just to clarify. So are we saying that we're no longer I mean, completely stop using Roundup.Parata.At the parks at this time? We are going to stop immediately in the parks, the golf courses, the mediums are we're going to still use them, but we're going to take this time to really assess the new regulations and the alternatives so that we can be able to have a more proactive plan.But for sure, the decision.Has been.To stop roundup in.In in the parks.I mean, listen, if we're gonna stop using Roundup in the parks, I'm not sure why we just don't stop using Roundup period. It's been I understand that, you know, my interest and I agree with some of the other comments there.There's so much I think data and research on there about Roundup that it's just it's very concerning to me that I'm glad that we're finally almost there. But I would feel better if we just stopped completely using Roundup.So we're going to beat it next week, you're saying? Okay. Well, then I'll wait till next week. But I think I think it's time to be completely off roundup up. And this is the time. All right, good. Any public comment on this?CNN, please cast your votes. Is there an agenda item next week?Yeah.Okay, great.All right.Councilwoman Price. Motion carries.Okay. Next item is.\nReasoning:Reasoning:",

We're doing 24. Then the public comment.Communication from Council Member Muranga recommendation to receive and file a presentation on the Century Villages at Cabrillo 2016. Social Impact Report.Mr. Guthrie. Anger.Thank you, Mayor. The Villages, it really is a wonderful project, has been a wonderful partner in the West Palm Beach area, providing homeless services as well as housing for those in great need. So I thought I would invite them to make a presentation, give us an update on some of their projects that are are going on there. And and also give me an opportunity to thank you for all the work that you do out there in the west and west side of Long Beach.Thank you, Councilman. Good evening, Mayor. City Council. City Staff. My name is Brian D'Andrea and with century villages at Cabrillo for some of our newer council members, CVC is a nonprofit that owns, manages and develops the 27 acre villages that Cabrillo Community in West Long Beach that's home to more than 1300 individuals on any given night, including550 veterans. The Villages was previously a naval housing site serving the Long Beach shipyards, and in 1997 the site was conveyed under the McKinney Act for the benefit of the homeless. We at century think of ourselves as the stewards of this really special place.And I think the the secret to our successes out in West Long Beach really has to do with this growing collaboration of more than 20 different partners that have come together to advance our our mission of restoring health and hope among our population.And at the heart of that collaboration is the city of Long Beach, which is really the ultimate backbone of our larger efforts to end and address homelessness across the city. Each year at the Villages, we pause and we take a look back at the prior year to to to evaluate our progress.That process requires an incredible amount of coordination across all of our partner agencies and under the supervision of an independent evaluator, Dr. Beth Menke, who's unfortunately not here tonight. She's with Cal State, Long Beach. We go about the process of aggregating outcomes and impacts and successes.I want to take a moment to acknowledge the hard work of one of my colleagues, Kim Crawford, our director of community development, who's behind me here. And I'm here tonight just to share a few highlights of our of that effort and of our 2016 village.That could be our social impact report. You all have a copy of it. The theme of this year's report is collective impact, and that's an approach to solving incredibly complex social problems by relying on the energy and talents and time of many different partners unified around a common agenda.And that's precisely what's happening out in West Palm Beach. Last year, thanks to the combined efforts of nearly 300 staff across all of our partners, we serve more than 2000 residents. We're achieving housing stability rates at at at a pace that exceeds industry standards.We're also helping our residents grow their incomes at a pace of nearly 5.5% per year, and that far outstrips both local, state and national averages. This year, we also evaluated the economic impact of the villages, looking at both our real estate development activities as well as our ongoing operations.Our operations have created more than $42 million of annual economic output across the county, supporting more than 600 jobs in our real estate development activity over the past past three years has generated more than $72 million of economic output, supporting nearly 375 jobs.So our report really validates, I think, what we've always known along the way, and that's that investing in permanent supportive housing changes lives and it can drive the economy. Lastly, I want to highlight one of our proudest accomplishments.A significant expansion of our internship program. Thanks to partnerships with local universities like Cal State, Long Beach, we've benefited, benefited from interns, volunteers and students who've contributed their time and energy to supporting our efforts. Last year, we had nearly 900 interns clock more than 30000 hours of service.They obtained meaningful and life changing experiences as a result and help support our larger effort. So we want to acknowledge all of our partners at the local university and obviously the students and interns that have have helped us.Next year, the villages will be 20 years in the making. Hard to believe. And over that time, the city has provided extensive support not only to our agency, but to many of our partners across the campus. That support spans many departments at the city, from Housing and Community Improvement to Housing Authority Planning, Building, Neighborhood Services, the portand many others. The city really should be incredibly proud of its investment in the villages and its leadership in helping to create the special space. The need for what we do is great. We know there's a large discussion happening at the city right now about homelessness.We look forward to being part of that dialog and continuing to partner with the city to to address this issue and continue our work together. Thank you.Thank you.Councilmember Andrews.Kind of.Oh. Oh. I was going to the. He's the second in the motion.Okay.Okay.Any other public comment on this item?I just want to thank Brian for his presentation this evening. And I think one of the most important things you left out is the current project that you're working in on the expansion of an additional 80 beds.Yes. Our anchor place development which the city has invested $4 million of capital and in 75 project based fashion vouchers is under construction. 120 permanent supportive homes will be coming online late next year.Thank you.Thank you. You guys do great work, Vice Mayor Richardson.Thank you. I just want to chime in and say what a what a fantastic report. This is the presentation. I just took a moment to look at it. You guys are doing great job. A great job. I wish we could duplicate you and take you all over town because the need is certainly there.And and you're definitely on the radar in the region, you know, at the Scaggs regional, you know, regional discussions, we you know, when we talk about the greenhouse gas cap and trade funding, Long Beach is up in the front at the forefront because frankly, because you guys have led those conversations.We want to continue to to support you in that. If it hadn't been for you, Long Beach, you would have seen a dollar of cap and trade funding. So thank you.Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.Yes. I also wanted to just say what a great job you guys have done. I have taken a tour twice of your facility and really been inspired by the stories that have come out of it and the model is fantastic.Really looking forward to partnering with you guys while you're based in the seventh. Your impact is citywide and anything that our office can do to work with you to build on all your successes and find ways where we can help other organizations connect with you and build on that as well.A great job.Councilman Gonzales.Great job, Bryan, to you and your team, I think. Incredible work. And I have to say, your social impact report is one of the best I've ever seen.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThank you very much. And then we have our fucking hearing, please.Report from Development Services recommendation to receive the supporting documentation into the record, conclude the public hearing and find the project exempt from the secure. Declare Ordinance. Amending Title 21 of the Long Beach Municipal Code to establish an interim motel conversion ordinance.Read the first time and later at the next regular meeting of the City Council for Final Reading and adopt a resolution to submit the ordinance to the California Coastal Commission citywide.We'll have Christopher Coons make the final presentation on this public hearing.And I will move quickly. Again, Christopher Koonce from Development Services. And I'm joined on the Web meeting by Alejandro Sanchez Lopez, who has been working on this project since he was an M.A. in 2017. And then we hired him in the department.So it's great when that works out. What this item is about is we have a number of motels in the city, likely an oversupply of motels in the city. But what we have an undersupply of as housing leading to our housing crisis.And specifically looking at the number of homeless residents or folks in danger of homelessness or severely rent burdened motels that become housing of last resort. But when they're operated as some blurry line between legitimate motel and housing, they can be subject to a number of nuisance issues.This program seeks to address both problems and builds upon existing efforts and recommendations from all of our various task force and reports that we need to be able to provide additional housing to provide rapid rehousing of homeless individuals and to be able to address our nuisance motels.So how does this ordinance work? Motels typically comply with a number of requirements when converting to housing, and there are certain disincentives to do that conversion. This program would allow a streamlined conversion from motel to supportive housing for a period of time with onsite social services.They would meet performance standards and the conversion itself would be a matter of right. They would not be able to expand or substantially change the footprint of the structure. This from a technical standpoint, this ordinance provides relief from sections of the zoning code that would otherwise prevent these motels from being converted into housing.It provides structure to revert to the prior use to basically revoke the conversion if necessary, by the city upon termination of the agreement with the property operator or at the request of the operator. It allows development services to review the applications in partnership with the Health Department, and it provides strict performance standards for the operators so thatthese facilities are operated in consideration to the surrounding community and we resolve any nuisance activity. This just shows you that this program, while it's a land use item, it's also a partnership between the city, our health department, nonprofits that may be operating these hotels.We're going to come into an agreement and we're all going to meet our expectations and our performance standards. In order for a conversion to occur, a multi-year contract has to be entered into between the operator and the city.So that would be a partnership between the operator, Development Services and Health and Human Services. The ordinance is intended to remove barriers and incentivize this type of conversion. And we did have some discussion at the Planning Commission about whether this would overburden any particular part of town.But there are motels, including nuisance motels spread throughout the city, even if there are more in certain districts than others. So with that staff as excited to move this project forward and we ask that you adopt the ordinance in front of you and I am glad to answer any questions.Any public comment on this item?There's no public comment on this item.We gave a motion to the second Councilman Richardson.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. This is this is this is incredible work. We've been talking about motel conversions for quite some time. Now, remember, we also made a motion on this maybe two, three years ago to look at this as a package of a whole host of things.Since then, there's been state legislation, there's been Project Homekey and a lot of focus here. But but it's taken taken some time. But I think we're now is the perfect time actually to leverage some of the state programs and figure out how we can address some of the new no nuisance motels in our city by converting theminto some purpose. That actually helps us solve our public policy challenges around housing availability in our community. So I'm really glad to see this and obviously supportive.Councilor Pearce.Thank you. Yeah, I'm really thrilled with staff's work on this. I recall in my first six months on office, which was over four years ago, we were talking about this. We had a lot of staff time dedicated to it.And I think converting these to transitional housing and providing homes for people is really critical. And I really applaud your staff's work to be creative and to stay focused. I hope that over the next decade even that we can open this up to more properties.I know that we went over the property list last time, but really what we should be really proud of this effort because it wasn't an easy lift. So good work in.Thank you. Council members and day house.Thank you, Mayor. I also want to say thank you very much to the staff. I am in full force, supportive. This is incredibly important to me and to my district that we provide more benefits for for our neighbors in experiencing homelessness.It has been such a joy to see this process come about. And I think all those who came previously, for all their efforts they did in bringing this forward and now we get to experience this. And I think it's going to be a great thing moving forward.And as my colleagues have said, you know, it's going to help us provide more services that are so, so much needed, not only in the first, but throughout the city and to the whole city as well. So thank you very much, staff.Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce.Q Mr. Mayor, I have a couple of questions for Christopher, for Mr. Coons, and that is in regards to holding strict guidelines for the operators of the facilities. What enforcement resources mechanisms? Staffing allocations, do we have to ensure that the operator will be held to the standard that we're all agreeing on?Because I think this is a fantastic program and I look forward to some of the nuisance motels even in my own district. I'm not familiar with all of them throughout the city, of course, but the ones in my district being considered but what I what I want to be able to make assurances of to residents is thatthe operators will be held accountable in terms of abiding by specific guidelines when they're operating, especially in close proximity to residential neighborhoods.I'm sure. So while this ordinance takes care of the land use, it also makes reference to entering into a contract. So in addition to the normal code enforcement process development services, we have a much better tool in this case and that you it's not profitable to operate homeless housing.So these providers are operating with funding either from the county, the city or another government agency. And they're entering into a contract with the city of Long Beach about the provision of those services that go along with the housing and the city maintains the right to terminate that contract, which would ultimately eliminate their ability to continue tooperate the facility. So we hold not only our normal nuisance abatement measures, but we hold the purse strings and we have a contractual relationship with these operators. So working with my partners in Health, because it's not development services staff on a day to day basis doing homeless services, but we would be working as a team and webelieve that additional leverage of the contract and potentially some funding provides us a greater degree of control over these facilities than you would find on a run of the mill land use, such as a restaurant or somewhere where we have to go through the nuisance process.That would not be the case in this circumstance.Follow up question, will the provisions that we're entering into this evening by way of adoption of this also apply to properties that are acquired through county funds or through county sources?So this program will apply? Yes, generally speaking, and the county we have shared the county provisions with them. And Kelly Cappelli, director of Health and Human Services, is having those discussions with the county, not myself, but the county, even if they're not legally required to, because they preempt us on some things.They have expressed their intent to meet these conditions and to operate in cooperation with the city and to coordinate entry so that we make sure that we're serving Long Beach homeless residents in these facilities, whether it's owned by the city, county or a third party.Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.Thank you, Councilwoman. Next up is Vice Mayor Andrews.Okay. Thank you. First of all, I want to thank Isaac and his team for putting the item together. You know, I believe that as a council, we are always forward thinking on how to help with the homeless crisis.You know, we have one more chance to participate in this conversation. We should be doing what we can do. I mean, to streamline the process for them. I'm just hoping that in establishing locations that all districts, you know, can help with this initiative.And again, I want to thank the team very much, Oscar Unity. Thank you.Roll call. Vote, please.District one. I District two I District.High.School, District fourth.In your high.High.District five.I.District six.High.District seven.I.District eight.I.District nine.

The committee recommends the bill passed.Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.I thank you, council president and thank you for I know that the chair of the committee is not present with us today, and I appreciate the fact that we're able to bring my bill before us today. I also appreciate that.So, again.I just said anytime, buddy.Oh, thank you. Thank you. Oh, I love this. Anyhow, I really also appreciate the public commenters today who called in, which is why I, along with Councilmember Lewis, created small landlord workgroup. And I know that there are some snags in getting that set up.And I can tell you that we both met about it this week to get it moving faster. And we both set up the rental market, rental housing market study. We funded that so that we could have that information for the first time since 2018 when that started, so that we can back up and so that we canhave the data that is with us today. It's important for us to have this data so that we can back up the stories of the mom and pop landlords who are selling their properties with the data before us so that we can make decisions with all the information.The bill before us today helps us ensure that landlords are made whole and tenants have a reasonable time to repay their debt. The tenant does remain responsible for repaying any and all debt that they've incurred. This bill is a technical correction to the legislation we passed in 2020, which was passed two months after the pandemic began.In May of 2020, the Council adopted ordinance 126081, which required that tenants with unpaid rent from the pandemic be offered repayment plans that lasted 3 to 6 months, depending upon the amount of rent owed. Today is April 26, 2022.If this was 2020, the pandemic would have started last month and we would have passed the underlying the original bill next month. At that time, we believe that the pandemic would only last two weeks and then two months, and we definitely did not foresee it lasting two years or more.We did know then when everything was shut and many people's line of work suddenly froze, that people needed time to address the debt incurred during that that closed down the following legislative session. The first legislation was legislative session in Olympia.Once the pandemic began, the state passed a similar repayment legislation. If we were in 2021, this bill would have passed. Nine days ago. The Legislature had the benefit of having a year longer to understand that the pandemic was going to last longer than two weeks or two months.The reason I refer to this modest bill as a technical correction is because the legislation before you today is a mirror of our state's legislation. There are some very small differences that come from the original bill and require and this bill requires a reasonable repayment plan for debt incurred during the COVID 19 state of emergency.Colleagues, I know I brought this up at council briefing before yesterday, and again, I'm happy to answer any questions.But are there any questions for Council Member Strauss? Right. Not seeing any. Madam Clerk, will you please call the roll on the passage? I'm sorry, Councilmember Nelson. And here you. Right?Yeah, go ahead.So I have to say thank you very much for bringing this forward, because I do believe that clarity in repayment plans is necessary. And I will admit that I missed the conversation in the in the Sustainability and Interest Rates Committee, and that's on me.However, that this legislation was was heard in committee only a couple of days after introduction, and we only had one meeting to discuss and vote. But regardless, what's important to me is that landlords had the ability to weigh in on this before we discussed it, and I'm told that was not the case.But basically this bill is characterized as a technical fix to bring us into alignment with state statute. And, you know, digging into this, since then, I've learned that it's it's it's not quite in perfect alignment and it would likely lengthen the time, the arrears specified in the in the repayment plans longer than the within the state statuteprovides for. So I'll just read some comments from central staff when I asked about this. This bill is tied to the end of the civil state, civil emerged cities, civil emergency, not the state's public health emergency and extends for six months after the end of the city's civil emergency, where the state statute does not extend past theend of the state public health emergency. The state ended its eviction moratorium on June 30th, 2021. So this has gone on much longer than that, and this would cover arrears that are incurred after six months, during the six month period after the end of the civil emergency or after the end of the eviction moratorium.There is much more detail in here. But the bottom line is that I am concerned about losing rental housing stock, particularly that of small landlords who have less resources to to weather the eviction moratorium and unpaid rent that is ongoing.And so they we require them to keep their properties in in good condition for their renters. And I'm just concerned about prolonging the time that that these small landlords will have to get that money to to maintain their properties and add additional uncertainty about when that might happen.So I, I again, apologize for bringing up these concerns at the last minute, but I will have to vote no on this on this piece of legislation.Thank you.

I'm I'm Debbie Potter, the city's space reuse and community development director and this item is requesting approval to submit a grant application in conjunction with Eden Housing for what we sometimes call the cap and trade money, which has the fancier HSC grant.And we set up the staff report in a way that provided some flexibility for for the Council because we were not sure which transportation projects would best fit within the grant application, and we were working on that. And one, we had two changes that we wanted to call to council's attention this evening prior to the Council's vote. One is that we are requesting lighting for the cross Alameda Trail that was value engineered out the first time around and we had the staff report reflect that cost of $800,000, that cost has actually gone up to $950,000.But fortunately, we can still be competitive under the grant with a $950,000 request. So we're asking that the resolution be modified or when you adopt the resolution to be modified to reflect the 950. And then we have determined that the Main Street project is the project we're going to move forward with.And depending on the budget, we would like to have the flexibility to add a new sidewalk on the east side of Main Street. And so we just want to call that to your attention to. And then the idea would be that we would ask that the Council adopt the resolution as amended to reflect the additional funding, the950,000 for the lighting and the opportunity to potentially do the new sidewalk on the east side of Main Street. And I will say that these few changes that we're proposing do not affect the overall maximum grant amount. So it would still be happening within that cap.So that is the request. And then we have the representatives from Eden Housing here this evening. They are chomping at the bit. They are really anxious to give the council an update on where they are with the two housing projects because a lot of a lot of progress has been made since the last time we were beforethe council in October. And so I would like to ask Lewis Lis, who is the project manager for Eden, to come up and give a brief update on the senior as well as the family housing project.I think I can speak for the council by saying that we love to hear about good progress, so come on up.Hello and thank you for the.Chance to make a.Brief update. It's good to see some new faces and some less new faces.And if you could get a little closer to the mic, we could even hear you.Awesome. So I just wanted to update that. The Alameda Point Senior Project, thanks to our close work with the council, is ready to close and we'll be closing in mid-February and starting construction soon after. So that'll be up and ready to go in 2020.And then as well as this asset grant, we're taking a few other shots for funding on Alameda Point Family and we're excited to keep you updated on how everything goes.That was brief. Okay. Thank you so much. All right, counsel, are there any questions or comments? Miss Potter, had you finished your remarks? Okay.

And each of you do solemnly state that the testimony you may give in the cause now and pending before this body shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.Thank you. Assistant City Manager Modica.Vice Mayor Lowenthal and members of the City Council. The staff report today will be given by Lia Eriksen, deputy director of the Financial Management.Good evening, Vice Mayor and members of City Council. We are requesting City Council approval of a 30 year location agreement with CRC Services LLC. CRC Services is a material and supply purchasing company which will purchase materials and supplies for resale to affiliates of California Resources Corporation.CRC CRC spun off from Occidental Petroleum Corp. on December 1st, 2014. CRC is the parent company of a consolidated group of corporations that primarily explore, develop and produce crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids in the State of California.CRC has a significant presence in Long Beach, with approximately 475 employees and 175 contractors. CRC is an economic engine for California. In order to achieve administrative and cost efficiencies, CRC services will centralize the procurement function for its larger material vendors in Long Beach.The centralization of procurement is expected to result in significant new sales tax revenue to the city. Under the proposed agreement, CRC services would receive 80% of the sales tax received by the city, and the city would retain 20% for the 30 year term.However, the split of sales tax would not occur in any year until the city receives a minimum base of sales tax revenue equivalent to 425,000. If an end of year CRC services receives less than 80% of the total sales tax revenue received by the city, that shortfall would be rebated in the next year in which enough revenueis generated to both meet the base and the shortfall. This is within a two year catch up period. The city currently receives minimal sales tax revenue from CRC services or its affiliated companies, since it is not currently located in Long Beach.While the volatile nature of the oil production industry makes it difficult to predict the exact amount of sales and use tax revenue that will be generated as a result of this agreement. Based on recent expenditures and the size and stature of the organization, the city anticipates receiving sales tax of at least 1.5 million and a low year, of which 425,000 would be retained by the city. As market conditions improve, estimated sales tax received by city may grow to 4 million or higher in a good year, of which of which at least 800,000 would be retained by the city in order to stimulate growth in this key industry in the city, enhance additional business to businesssales tax revenue, retain and grow jobs, and support the city's efforts to fund critical services to our residents. City staff is pleased to recommend that Council conclude a public hearing, authorize the city manager to enter into a 30 year location agreement with CRC Services LLC.Thank you, Councilmember Richardson. Okay. And Councilwoman Price, did you have any comments on this matter? Thank you. Is there any member of the public that wishes to address the council on here? Am I hearing item two?

Let's go ahead and do the next item, which is 37. I'm sorry. Item 38. And then that will to kick us off will be based on. And let's let's meet the fans, please. Aspirant athletes read the item.And then by tomorrow.Communication from Vice Mayor Andrews, councilman, super nice councilwoman, mango councilman Austin. Recommendation to request City Manager to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a temporary suspension of the proactive rental housing inspection program and business licensing. Renewal fees for residential rental property owners and commercial property owners impacted by COVID 19.And request city manager to find additional financial relief or incentives at the local level for residential and commercial owners that are directly impacted by revenue loss due to the COVID 19.Vice Mayor Andres.Yes. Thank you. Again, I want to thank you my co-sponsors of this item. These have been some very hard weeks and I don't quite see us recovering soon. But thankfully, we are all in this together. The problem with this item is they help alleviate some of the unfortunate circumstances.Residents and commercial property owners were seen as a result of COVID 19. With the loss of income, rent increase, business activities and new measures, I believe it is important that we as a city step up and help reduce the burden while we can.Right now we know our code enforcement department is not conducting any special inspections unless complaints as far. And since many landlords are not going to be seeing a rent payment until November 1st, I would like for us to say that to give property owners an opportunity to pay any revenues and annual fees due to the city ofLong Beach in 2020 and to January of 2021. Additionally. Be sure to spend any code enforcement fees that may have occurred doing the business closure if the violation was apparent by the actions taken due to this crisis. We also know that some businesses are were in the middle of opening as covered.Came along with this uncertainty. I think we need to defer any set up until these business have time to open and operate in normal situation. Lastly, traffic control fee for our communications and wireless companies are closed. At this time, I know we have various projects in the pipeline and they are being held on the same standards thatthe land developer and at the time when people at home acquired low cost in some scenarios free Wi-Fi and home services. I do not believe we should be charging these companies thousands of dollars in traffic control fees for projects that are already in the works to expand fiber.I'm looking forward to the dialog and again, thank you again for my presence.Thank you. I'm going to that is that that's emotion Vice Mayor Andrews.It is. Yes, it is.Okay, great. I do have other makers who signed on to this item, so I'm going to read those council members that signed onto this item. Customer Super. Nor do I have any comments on that.Yes. Do you have a second yet?Not yet.I'll go ahead and second.Great. Jeff, any comment?Yeah. I wanted to look at possible inclusion of a couple of items. Other piece of staff could look at that, such as business licensing, fire planning, check if if there were any other assistance that we can provide. To the appropriate owners in this case.Thank you. Also I have on this item was Council District five.Yes. Thank you. I think it's critical at this time that we provide any relief possible so that the business owners and can focus really on their workers and getting their business reopened and providing for a lot of these businesses and providing for the community even though they're hurting.I'm in full support of this item and I think Councilmember Vice Mayor Andrews for his leadership and ideas on this a few weeks ago. And I think that in my talks with the services, we're really not doing the pier of inspections anyway because tenants don't want city employees in their home at this time.And so to to charge their landlords for services not rendered just doesn't make a lot of sense. And that money can be used for relief. So thank you very much.Thank you. And then the last time around, this item with Councilmember Austin.Thank you. And I'm happy to move my attention this item on. Thank God, Councilmember Mayor Andrews and the rest of the council members for bringing it forward on this day. Obviously, COVID 19 has an impact on property owners, on many states and within my district and depend on our rental income, and many are retired and on fixedincome. This program makes sense to help the entire economic chain during this crisis, but 2021 budget rental properties and on top of the lending relief now we can and looking at a broad lens when it comes to on the economic relief and I've been happy to support.Thank you.I have customary ringa.I want to thank all the cast members who brought this forward. It's very important for them as appropriate owners and writers who are experiencing some difficulties in good times to work with their hands regarding staff. If we're going to be conducting inspections as management need any plans for utilizing the staff level areas where we may be, wherethe employment is or how we need.Yeah. This is Tom. I've got Linda Tatum who's on the line to talk a little bit about what our inspectors are doing right now.Green. These council members told enforcement staffers right now are transitioning to leave the leave and what they call the gender enforcement program, that is to make sure that businesses that should not be open are effectively frozen. So we actually have staff that are cooperating with the police department, as well as the city attorney's office and the healthdepartment so that we can use code enforcement staff that would otherwise be doing rental inspections. They're now on the vendor task force to ensure that businesses that should be closed do remain closed.Thank you. Okay. Next up, it's customers and they have for clarification.Is this just a temporary thing or are we trying to be reevaluated back when when January comes?Yes. This is just a positive thing. And this is sincere.Okay. I also wanted to thank you for bringing this up, so thank you for clarifying that.Governor Richardson.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I just wanted to chime in and say thanks to Vice Mayor Andrew for putting this together. You know, we know that there are some things that we we can and we can do to help property owners.Example, mortgage relief is not within our power. So we should be looking at things that are within our powers. That's what I interpret that this does. I look forward to, you know, the evaluation of staff on, you know, you know what this is going to cost and all those other things.I think it's important. I think they should do it. I think the angels in the details. But this is these are the types of things that we should be talking about during this crisis. I mean, for me, I think it would be important to kind of align both the housing security work that we did around eviction moratoriumswith sort of some of the economic relief to the mortgage folks so that folks who are property owners. So that as sort of we come out of a safe way at home, we know there's some gradual sort of pain that folks have to make up on rent.So we should have some gradual time to get back on track for the fees and some of these other things that been going on since there's been so much support. I support the motion. I look forward to coming back.And Vice Mayor, you had some additional comment.With the one with Daryl and Jeff, except that you always trying to get us to, you know, take under consideration. So I would do that, Darrell.Okay. Councilwoman Pierce.Thank you. Yes. I believe that this item is in alignment with what the council has already demonstrated that we believe should be happening. And so I think it makes sense to pause those fees. I do have I would want to see the staff report that comes back to include the same thing that Councilmember Richardson just said, whichis alignment with what is happening with rents. So I'd want to make sure that, you know, if if people are content starting to pay rent in November, that we make that adjustment to the schedule as well. And to.I did have a question. So if, as Linda stated, we currently do not have period happening. Are there other cases where a tenant can call and somebody will come out or is no code enforcement happening right now? Councilman Pierce, thank you for that question.Let me clarify that, because still responding to complaints regarding health and life safety issues. It's just that they're not going out doing the routine proactive inspections, but we are doing the proactive life and health safety for all people and for any other code enforcement complaints that we receive.So life and health safety are still priorities and we are still responding to those as usual. Thank you. Thank you for that. And so thank you, everybody, that brought this item forward. I think it makes sense. You know, if tenants are not paying rent, that we alleviate some financial stress for landlords.We want to make sure that we do bring this back in a timely manner so that our city can continue to deliver necessary services. Thank you.Okay. Thank you. That concludes the comments for this item. Madam Quirk with your off.District one.By.District two. I District three.I.District four.Huh?

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nYes, Madam President. I move that council bill 1058 be ordered published.Thank you. We need it to be moved and seconded. Thank you. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 1058. Council Member Sawyer.Thinks Madam President, I called out this bill so that I can vote no on it. Before I say anything else, I want to recognize our incredible city staff who's worked so hard over the last 20 months under extraordinary circumstances.And I fully support the premium and hazard pay proposals that are also on first reading tonight. But our city doesn't have unlimited funds, and I believe that the taxpayers would prefer we use this money to invest it in our community.So let's talk about what else could be done with this money if we chose to use it differently. This money is $5 million. It could build five miles of sidewalks. It could install seven new stoplights, depending on the cost, renovate four city playgrounds, fill the funding gap needed to complete the renovation of the Downtown Central Library Fund, the city's financial commitment on at least three affordable housing developments through host. This is five times the amount of money that the city has set aside from ARPA funds for small business safety and security grants. With this $5 million, we could staff foot and bike patrols and implement community policing programs in ten unique neighborhoods in our cityfor a full year. As grateful as I am to our staff. I find it difficult, difficult to allocate money to bonuses when there are so many outstanding projects that need to be funded in our city. And for this reason, I'm voting no tonight.Thanks, Madam President.Thank you, Councilmember Sawyer. Next up, we have Councilmember CdeBaca.Thank you. I echo the sentiments of my colleague, Councilwoman Sawyer. I feel it's inappropriate to provide bonuses for people to do something medical with their body. It feels like this is something we should have thought about when we were forcing people to be deployed into shelters.Or we should have done other things to let our workers know that we appreciate them. This feels inappropriate. And so I'll be a no on this tonight. Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember CdeBaca. Councilmember Hines.Thank you, Madam President. And I want to thank my colleagues. They've said some of the things that I would already say. I'm very happy to support our employees and in Denver and intend to do so with the bill that is here in introduction tonight.This particular one was a confusing rollout. And in addition to the things my colleagues have already said, and even in the press release that the press release talks about how much our employees have sacrificed. I agree with that 100%.I'm not sure that we should have that in the press release, when in fact all this is meant to do is a reward for those who have already been vaccinated. So if we wanted to do a reward, I think that we should have announced that earlier.So it's just a very confusing rollout. Again, and in addition to all the things my colleagues have already said. Thank you. Council President.Thank you, Councilmember Hines. Next up, we have Councilmember Clark.Thank you, Madam President. I have tried to get there on this proposal, and I do want to thank the staff who worked on this to make it better than it was when it was first proposed. I also want to say that I'm fully supportive of the hazard pay proposal that separate from this.But a bonus for getting vaccinated, I believe, is missing the mark for many reasons. First, as I've stated before, giving a bonus for something that everyone should be expected to do furthers the idea that getting vaccinated is a bonus or an extra thing that people can do if they'd like.We should be focused on letting all residents of Denver know that getting vaccinated is not an extra. It is the responsibility of responsible citizens in our community to get vaccinated, to protect themselves, and to protect the rest of us.Hundreds of thousands of Denver residents have done their civic duty and have gotten vaccinated because it's the right thing to do, and they're not getting bonuses for that. Also, as I've shared before, I've been told by many of my constituent that Denver, my constituents, that Denver rewarding city employees for doing the right thing feels to them likea slap in the face. Furthermore, rewarding employees who got vaccinated only when they were required to. At the same financial level that employees are being rewarded who did the right thing the first day they were eligible to do so also feels like a slap in the face for thousands of Denver city employees who did the right thingthe first opportunity they had and didn't have to be mandated to do it. I do think that is really important after a really rough over year to make sure that we tell our employees that we do value them.In the past year and a half has been really hard and that we appreciate what they have done and what they continue to do. That's really important. And I think that there are a lot of ways that we could have done that in a lot of ways that we could have structured this to reward employees without itbeing tied in the way that it is, to the same reward for people who voluntarily did this when they first could and provided months of extra protection for Denver residents and and folks who who didn't didn't do that and possibly got other people passed COVID on to other people before they were mandated to get a vaccination.So I think that this is ill conceived as proposed, not the intent, but in in the mechanism of how we're doing it. And so for those reasons, I will also be a know this evening. Thank you, Madam President.Thank you, Councilmember Clark. Next up, we've got Councilmember Cashman.Thank you, Madam President. Unfortunately, we while the math is correct and the dollars would allow for a variety of other projects to be completed, mathematically, we don't have the employees to complete the projects that are on the books now.We were not picking up the trash in our parks as frequently as we would like to in the maintenance in our parks. Hasn't been up to the standards that I know our parks department would like were down. Police officers were down.Sheriff's. Every department is down. And we're in competition with in the industries across our city, private industries and across the country. So we're in a real world where we've got to stop the bleeding. This program, which I opposed when it was initially presented and as I've considered it, gave us a dual opportunity to stimulate, increase the percentageof our employees who did get vaccinated, to reward all people who got vaccinated, as well as those who met the criteria for legitimate exemptions. We've got to compete with industries that will offer our people more money than than we can offer them in our annual budget.So I'm willing to offer this thank you to to our employees. It is not. I wish it could be more. It could probably have been structured in a different way. But I'm going to say yes to this. Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember Cashman. Next up, we have Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. It's taken a minute for my camera to turn on. I'm not sure what's going on with that. So I also want to weigh in in support of this particular piece of legislation tonight.I appreciate the extra work that was done by our finance department after listening to input from members of the City Council. I think. Folks need to be reminded that our employees took 2020 a number of furlough days and we're scheduled to have furlough days in 2021.But those were canceled, but they took a huge financial hit in 2020 at a time that many of them were having to work at the vaccine sites and at the testing sites and at the food distribution sites. And some of the very families, some of our employees or some of the very families that were having to bein line at DPS and at our food banks because not everybody makes you know. Affordable living wages that works for our city. And so I think this is an important way to reward our employees, not only who have taken this.The hazard pay, I think, is an important element of this. And for those who have chosen not to and have not provided any kind of. Waiver that's been approved. Those are people who are lucky to get this. You know, this this extra pay.So I just appreciate the work that is being done and has been done by all of our city employees. And I'm going to be supporting this through. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Councilmember Ortega. Next up, we've got Councilmember Flynn.Thank you, Madam President. I would rather have all employees vaccinated. And if it means offering bonuses as incentives, the goal is to get people vaccinated and tamp down the virus. That's going to be with us for quite some time.We want to get our as many folks vaccinated in our city and our region and our state as possible. And I support this, as do numerous other entities American Airlines, Aldi, Kroger, Target, Wal-Mart are all offering their employees bonuses to get their vaccines so that we can beat the virus.It would be a Pyrrhic victory to say we're we're not going to pay bonuses. You should do the right thing and get the vaccine and then put up with the continued spread of the virus through our community. So I will support this measure tonight.Thank you, Madam President.Thank you. Councilmember Flynn, Councilmember Clark, we have you back up.Yeah, thank you. Madam President. I just want to make a quick clarification. Totally. You know, all of the time we disagree up here and totally respect all my colleagues in all of our disagreements. That's part of democracy. I just want to clarify, we talked about this in committee, but didn't want this to go and end up inthe media. I want to clarify that this is not a bonus for people to get vaccinated. In fact, in committee asked very directly, will this get one more person vaccinated, one more person with the vaccine closer to the end of COVID?And the answer was no. This is a reward for things that have already happened. This is not an incentive and it will not increase the number of people vaccinated one bit. So I just wanted to clarify on that point, which is again, part of why I'm.No, thank you, Madam President.Thank you, Councilmember Clarke. Councilmember Hines, you're back up.Thank you. Council President. The only thing I would add to Councilmember Clark's comment is that this was announced just a few days before the deadline for the end of vaccinations if there's really want it. If this was meant to be an encouragement and incentive, it would have been presented months before.Thank you.Thank you. Councilmember Hines.

The North Delridge Action Plan is also discussed, which recognizes the four specific neighborhood areas identified in the plan. The committee recommends the bill pass, and it is passed by the council.Therefore, the summary of the meeting transcripts is:\nAN ORDINANCE accepting the gift of funds for design and purchase of plantings at four business nodes along Delridge Way SW as part of the Delridge Way SW - RapidRide H Line project."

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nOkay, so I pulled this one and I gave this Smith from public works very short notice that I was doing this. I'm sorry, but it's. So this one, just for the public is falling. Following along is a recommendation to authorize the city manager to execute a short term agreement with the East Bay Municipal Utility District, our waterprovider to provide services for the city of Alameda potable water system at Alameda Point. The language in this is a very brief staff report. There's a language that caught my eye. Was that talking about in the first paragraph of the background paragraph on page one that we are looking at a short term agreement for East Bay Medto continue services up to six months while the city and has been met to continue negotiating in terms of an agreement that addresses the phasing of new incremental development in the adaptive reuse area of Alameda Point. That's where our Alameda Point collaborative and historic Alameda Point areas are.And this was the language that I wanted to ask about and explore the possibility of the city transitioning from East Bay Med to an outside contractor for operations and maintenance services of existing water infrastructure, if possible, and if authorized by the State Water Board.Resources Control Board Division of Drinking Water City Staff is conducting due diligence on multiple fronts on the water quality and public safety implications of changing from East Bay Med to a private contractor and is not currently recommending this approach.And I think given that, you know, nothing operates in a vacuum and we follow the news from around the Bay Area, around the country, and we've all heard of Flint, Michigan, and the horrendous situation there. So my first question is, why would we even be considering looking at someone besides our water utility to provide this these servicesoperations and maintenance of existing water? And this is apparently drinking water, potable water. And also, who else does this? Are there are there private contractors in and what was the impetus for for this consideration?Thank you both. Really good questions. So we are actively doing our due diligence to better understand what it would look like to have an operator that's not used. Payment is East Bay, mud is the potable water provider for the area.They typically aren't in the business of providing this operation and maintenance services for a system that's not their own. So they have been providing the service for us since late 1990s through this JPA. The JPA expired in this short term agreement and.The JPA would be a.Joint sorry, ours with the.Waters Agreement. This short term agreement essentially extends the services that was in that Joint Powers Agreement for six months. So we can better understand from a legal, regulatory and technical front what that would mean to have an operator that's not East Bay mud.So we don't have the answers that you are seeking now. But this six months should allow us the time to better understand that we're also working with an outside specialist, a special counsel, to assist us in understanding what it would mean.So was the primary consideration for looking at other possible providers. The fact that he's been made doesn't normally do service and maintenance on facilities that aren't their own correct.And we're also in parallel to us doing our due diligence for a possible alternative operator. We are in discussions about what the new development would look like in that reuse area, meaning the replacement of the old, the Navy water infrastructure with East Bay mud.So as we have more clarity on that, the operational piece might be able to piece into that as well. So a lot of moving parts at this point, but hopefully the six months will allow us to get the clarity we need.Right. And so then we will expect to report back to the council. Absolutely. Okay. Great answers, as always. Thank you, Ms.. Smith.Thank you.Any other.Question?Questions then and thank you.Thank you. So then. Thank you. I will move it. A move approval then of this recommendation to authorize the city manager to execute a short term agreement with the East Bay Municipal Utility District to provide services for the city of alameda potable water system in alameda point.We have a second.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\n13 Eyes Council Bill 20 2-169 has passed. Moving on. Councilmember Sandoval, will you please put Council Bill 22, dash three, four, four on the floor for final passage?Yes, I move that. Council Bill three, four, four be placed and adopted.All right, we'll place three, four, four on final consideration and do pass and we've got a motion and the second thank you. The required public hearing for Council Bill 22, Dash three, four, four is open. And we have Karen here for the staff report.Thank you. Good evening. My name is Karen. I'm a principal planner with Landmark Preservation and Community Planning and Development. And we are here for the designation of three, four, three five Albion Street, which is shown here with the arrow on the property of the overview.This property is located in Council District eight in Northeast Park Hill. You very recently approved a rezoning from a P.O.D. to mx2x. This particular property came in as a certificate of demolition eligibility about a year ago through a facilitated stakeholder process with the property owners, the community, historic Denver Landmarks staff, a preservation minded buyer was found andSteve Davis has purchased the property. Steve also worked on the Butler House. So that's if you know I'm not on this particular property, you can see on the lower right image this used to be a restaurant and prior to designation the non contributing 2005 addition was removed and so it's now designating the original portion of the structureon the upper left photo. Here is an aerial of the property prior to the removal of the demolition of the of that of that wing. And then on the right, you see the landmark boundary, which is on sort of the lower half of the property.And so we wanted to show you a site plan of this particular property. Steve Davis, after rezoning is going to do a zonal split to add density to the northern portion of the site. So you can see the white box on the bottom is the landmark portion.And then currently under concept review with development services is the plan for the northern portion of the site to add density. So you'll have the house fence, a driveway, and then you'll have the other units that will be fronting 35th Avenue, whereas this will front Albion Street.As you know, for a property to be designated according to the landmark ordinance, the structure must meet, maintain its integrity, must be 30 years of age or older. The structure needs to meet at least three out of ten criteria, and the OPC needed to consider the structure's historic context.This property meets three of the landmark criteria which we'll go through now. So first, that it has direct association with historic event or with the historical development of the city. This particular property represents the early boom and bust of Denver in the 1890s.This area was developed by John Cook Jr as the North Division of Capital Hill. This was the first house that was built on speculation in this particular subdivision in 1889, and building on speculation was new to the city of Denver at that particular time.Unfortunately for John Cook JR investors did not follow and there weren't really many other houses built in his subdivision. This is a 1905 based map that you're looking at here, and you can see there aren't very many properties that were constructed in the area.The panic of 1893 occurred and the boom abruptly ended. And so this particular property represents the early boom of the 1880s and then the 1893 bust that the city went through. When the silver panic, when the silver was not used anymore.And you had the panic of 1893. It's also significant is really being sort of on this property that straddled the urban and rural area of Denver. This is a.1933 aerial.And you can see even at that point, there weren't very many properties there. And so this represents sort of an area when North Park Hill was really on the edge of Denver. Here are a couple of photos of the family that resided there for the longest tenure, the row family.They ended up using the house as a small family farm because in the 1920s there weren't enough houses around it and that was the best use of the property. The amenities in the area were really absent for the first few decades and remained that way until the area eventually developed through the postwar era in the 1950s.And so it has a direct association with the development of the cities from the 1889 through the 1950s, when the row family left the property. It is also significant for its queen, an architectural style. This can be seen in the steeply pitched roof with a cross gable, the dominant front facing gable.Asymmetrical appearance, the two story porch. One of the things that Queen Anne is really known for is its devoid of smooth walls. So you'll see a lot of brickwork, stonework, decorative wood elements, birch boards, spindles on the porch.But the Queen Anne's were rather fussy and didn't want to have smooth wall appearances. And so you can see that these are the character defining features of the Queen Anne style. And then finally, it's significant under the Criterion G for promoting the understanding and appreciation of the urban environment by means of its distinctive physical characteristics and itsrarity. So as you look at this building today with the other properties around it, it's primarily surrounded by two revivals from the twenties and thirties, minimal traditionals from the forties and fifties and postwar housing. And then some recent larger scale development.And the stylistic elements that are found in these tend to be more simplified. Whereas you see in the elaborate Queen in, it stands out with its extensive detailing and distinctive characteristics. And then it's also significant for its rarity in Northeast Park Hill, as well as the Greater Park Hill neighborhood.There are very few houses of the same vintage in Northeast Park Hill. There's the McCoy house, which was built in 1889, the same time as the Robinson House. But it's a smaller Victorian cottage to the north and this is a better example of a queen in style.And then within the Greater Park Hill neighborhood, there are only a handful of homes constructed before the 20th century of this style and vintage. And so it's significant for its physical characteristics and its rarity. In terms of integrity.We look at does the property look like what it used to look like? So there are a number of we are all the alterations on this property, but they don't distract from the Queen in styling from the front of the right of way.It maintains its original location. The design materials and workmanship are retained, as is the feeling, setting and association. And then the LPC considered the historic context in the period of significance of this property as is appropriate for properties that are designated.The historic context context match as well with the criteria for which it's designated. It represents the initial planning and expansion of Denver, the speculation and then economic collapse, the rural area of the nature of the area in the first several decades.And then the period of significance extends through the ownership of the longest tenured owners, the Rowe family, which sold in 1953. Overall, it is over 30 years of age. The application needs at least three of the criteria. It retains integrity and the OPC considered its historic context.The Landmark Preservation Commission unanimously motion to forward this for your review and CPD staff recommends approval.All right. Thank you for the staff report, Kara. And this evening, we have five individuals signed up to speak. Our first speaker is in person in chambers. And it's Steven Davis.I'm the buyer. My wife and I, Jan, are buying this.Property. I do a lot of work in historic districts and I've worked on many landmarks. And the Bazaar House, as you heard up in the Highlands area. Actually, it's also known for Amanda Sandoval announced her candidacy for the city council.True.True.Anyway, in this process of working with this talk Denver to find or they would find homes that they wanted me to buy they would send me out there to try to wrestle away a contract or with a guy or gal.And and so I've had two failures in getting that accomplished. Those homes were ultimately demolished. So it's a it's an unfortunate thing. But on this particular home, for whatever reason, the seller decided to sell or the guy who had under contract and there was a good, you know, sort of exciting thing.And so I'm very happy to kind of pursue getting this home restored and brought back to its original glory. It's a it's a nice house. The councilman from District eight had a chance to go through it and see it prior to rehabilitation.So he knows what they look like and he has quite a bit of challenges. So I look forward to. Restoring the Robeson House as a new Denver landmark if the city council is able to approve the landmark designation.Thank you very much.Thank you. Our next speaker is David Hagan, joining us virtually. Do we still have David Hagan with us? Okay. It looks like we've lost David Hagan and so we'll go ahead and move on. Michael Flowers.Michael Flowers. I work with Historic Denver, which is located at 1420 North Street in the old Emerson School. We are a 523 nonprofit dedicated to preserving Denver's unique identity cultural landmarks as workplaces. We fully support this designation of the Robinson House as a landmark staff discuss.The House helps tell the history of Denver's development, and it's one of the oldest extant houses in Northeast Parkhill. Robinson House also helps tell the story of the neighborhood from the late 19th century to now, and many still affectionately know it is.Kate's restaurant has been a fixture on the spot since 1889, and despite things changing around it with Steve's plan to rehabilitate the House.It will have a vibrant.Future in the neighborhood, but not always the history in Portland. It's also been valued by the community as well. The raw materials first came to our attention through our 50 Actions 50 Places campaign, which we asked the Denver community to help us identify the next 50 places to take a preservation action for the celebration of our 50thanniversary. Not long after receiving that nomination, the former owner of the property applied for a certificate of demolition eligibility. Community members came together to sign a notice of intent to designate. And through that process, the mediation was started to delay the issuance of the CDE.And during that time Steve was able to purchase the home and he's developed a plan to rehabilitate the home. But the townhomes on the north side of the property, that density and also landmarked the property. So as I said before, we fully support this this landmark designation.And I hope you will, too. Thank you.Thank you. Our next speaker is joining us via Zoom, Tess Dougherty. Do we have tests with us? Okay. We're trying to get you to accept the promotion test since we have you signed up. Well, given another try here.Still no acceptance. Okay. We'll go ahead and move on to our last speaker this evening, Jesse Paris. Okay. Go ahead, please, with your comments, Jesse. Jesse, you can go ahead with your comments. It's looking like from our end the just season muted.So we'll. Try it once more. Go ahead, Jesse. Are we having an issue with Zoom or anything? All right. Well, we have just in the queue, but I'm not. Hearing from him. Okay. We're going to go ahead and move on then.That concludes our speakers this evening for this required public hearing. Questions from members of Council on Council Bill 22, Dash 344 Council Member CdeBaca Thank you.Not questions. Just a thank you for saving this little house. This is the house I drive by almost every day, and I have hoped that somebody would see the beauty in it. And I also hope that you guys will add to the history that the first museum for black girls was in that building right in the lastyear or two. And hopefully they blow up and do all the cool things that they're doing across the country. Charlie Billingsley is awesome and fully expect her to go down in history and you guys will have been the first place where she exhibited the museum for Black Girls.Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember CdeBaca. And not seeing anyone else in the queue will close the public hearing. And any comments from members of Council on Council Bill 22, Dash three, four, four. And thank you, Councilmember CdeBaca, for sharing that history.And Councilmember Herndon, do you have any comments?Thank you, Madam President. Just I urge my colleagues to support this. I think the criteria has been met. I was in this when it was a restaurant, however long ago it was. And I do appreciate historic Denver and all the parties who came together to save this and be able to do the rezoning so that we canstill designate the building and still allow for gentle density to happen on that parcel as well just to the north. So thank you all and I look forward to seeing it when it's complete. And thank you, Madam President.Thank you, Councilmember Herndon. Councilmember Sandoval.Thank you, Madam President. I just want to give a shout out to the Davises for being such thoughtful, historic preservationists. I know my predecessor called on you a lot. I know I've called on you a lot. So any time we see these diamonds in a rough, I know that I can call on you and you can goout there and use all the skills that you had working on all the projects in Denver. The Bosley House is my favorite. I see Jan walking by my house every day and then I want to go walk by United House.So just want to thank you and thank you for the partnership with Historic Denver and also just want to call out the process that when we opened up the historic ordinance, you know, there was a lot of concern of what would happen with that historic ordinance and adding this mediation and this pause to be able to getthe applicant and other people at the table to talk, which is part of democracy, is talking about what our intentions are, have actually come with good results. So just want to thank everyone for their work. Those are not easy conversations.I've been in them as a council aide and as a council member when you're talking about property and property rights and values. So just want to say that thank you to everyone who had a great outcome because this could ended in a different way, which we all know too well in northwest Denver.Thank you, Madam President.Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval. And likewise, I think that this meets all of the criteria. I'm very happy to support it and see it once it's restored in all its glory. And so thank you to the property owners for doing that well and Karen for her untiring patience and work on preservation in our city.We really appreciate that.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nOkay. Next is item 24.A report from Technology and Innovation recommendation to improve the city's open data policy and related standards to implement modern city wide practices for sharing data with the public, staff and policymakers citywide.Okay. There's a lot of big items tonight. This is another very important one that we're very proud of. I want to make sure that staff stay with the council, know what we're doing, because it's going to it's going to change a lot of the ways we do business, which is great.So Mr. West.Brian Stokes, our director of innovation and Technology.Honorable Member, Members of the City Council, before use a recommendation to approve our city data policy as it's related to standards to implement a modern citywide practice in sharing data with the public, staff and policymakers. The purpose of this policy is to set guidelines for incorporating an open data framework into existing and future systems and procedures, andto aid in determining which data sets should be made public. How to make those data sets public, and how to maintain the existing published data sets. Back in 2015, the Technology and Innovation Department met with the Technology and Innovation Commission and with the idea of creating this open data policy and in the spirit of openness and collaboration, TID wanted to engage the community as well as city departments. So we had conversations around open data by holding three community forums. One was virtual, one was at Long Beach City College and the other one was at California State University at Long Beach.In addition to those forms, we've also held out citywide surveys and we put out an online on Speak Up Long Beach with regards to open data. All of these results and community engagement came back with feedback and in partnership with the city departments.We've established this policy and that is what is presented to you tonight. And with that, that is my report.Okay. Thank you. I want to just also add. It's really important. I think also that we think a lot of this work is also done by the Technology and Innovation Commission, and they felt they actually were at all these forums.They held the forums, they work with staff. I know that the the chair of the commission is here, Rob Kariuki, who's in the in the back there. I know he's going make a few comments I think doing public comment, but I just want to thank them for that.They worked very hard on this policy. They got a lot of input to put this policy together. And because of this, we're going to start to start putting a lot of data online for for folks to look at and hopefully to use it to make the city more open and accessible and and transparent as well.So thank you to everyone that worked on this policy. Councilmember Austin.Thank you. I made the motion here. But Mr. Mayor, I want to commend you for your leadership on this issue. I know this is something that you work very, very hard to make sure was implemented. I want to come in to commend technology and innovation in the IT team for all their great work and most importantly, thecommunity for their their input and feedback on this. I encourage my my members, my council colleagues to support this idea.Thank you. Vice Mayor Richardson.I thank the maker of the motion. Said it really well, not much more I can add. Keep up the good work. Actually use those maps a lot. You just, you know, dispelling, you know, things that aren't true about North Lobby.So I support this.Thank you. Councilman Orengo.I think this is an excellent policy. It creates a 24 hour city hall. And you said it already. It creates more transparency so people know exactly what we're doing here. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Mongo.I just wanted to give our I.T. manager an opportunity to discuss a little bit about how we plan to integrate that data with a bigger surrounding community. So what many of us know is that many cities are doing open data, and then the county has an open data site that has a lot of data, especially for citiesthat contract out more of their services to say, the sheriff's department or animal control, L.A. County or any of those. And I was hoping to at least get a little insights to the community on where we're going next and how we can integrate that on a wider scale.Okay. Thank you, Councilwoman. I'm going to have staff respond to that.Yes, Councilmember Mongo. The intent in our soon to be release portal does look at avenues to incorporate not just data sets that are solely owned and managed by the city, but also data sets that can be not just regionally but globally.So, yes, we would reach out if they had and wanted to share certain data sets, we would incorporate them into the site as well as any APIs that they may want to share.And vice versa.Correct.Wonderful. Because right now, when you go on to the larger model to look at the animal data right now on an L.A. County site, the entire Long Beach area is just blink because they don't have our data as well.And so hopefully they'll be able to click on it. It would bring them back to our site, which would then create a loop of people engaging with our open data portal. So I look forward to seeing that. Thank you so much.Great. Thank you. And now we're going to move on to public comment. Public comment, I think we have Rob here. And as it's coming down, the this will this will initiate the launch of our actual site that all this amazing data is going to be on the for the public to use and see in real time.It's going to be really exciting. So. Mr. Chairman.Thanks, Mr. Mayor, in a city council. Thanks very much for taking this issue up tonight. I think that Brian did a really excellent job of outlining what the portal is going to do. But and as you alluded to, Mr. Mayor, this is a very big deal.It's a big deal for the city of Long Beach. I think there's not an issue on the agenda tonight that open data would not contribute to the discussion, too. It helps inform administrators as they work among the various departments, helps inform residents about what's going on in their city.And then ultimately you as policymakers can make use of it as well. I've worked on this issue in a lot of different jurisdictions. I sponsored legislation at the state level on the issue. It was discussed the stakeholder process that we went to, and we had a lot of really great engagement in shaping this policy.We'd be the 10th city in California to adopt such a policy, and I think just the 50th nationwide. But I want to talk just briefly about the three kind of macro opportunities that I think this policy presents. The first is to spur innovation in our community by freeing up this information, allowing folks to combine it with otherjurisdictions. As Councilwoman Mongo mentioned, you can create new apps, you can learn new things, and the community can really aid the city in trying to solve some of its more pressing problems. That data is also of inherent value, so that spurs economic development.The McKinsey Global Institute pegged the worldwide value of open data at over $3 trillion. And so, again, Long Beach could be at the forefront of this. There's a lot of great firms in our city that want to make use of this data, and they'll have their hands on it soon.The second is to spur innovation within government, to allow departments to collaborate with one another, to allow cities and counties to share information among themselves. In the city of New York did a study after the implementation of their policy, they found they're saving $10 million a year annually just on Freedom of Information requests through their portal.And then the final and possibly the most important is I think this affirms the city's commitment to open, honest and effective government. It's a critical peg of transparency, and it's going to invite the community into the goings on to the city and invite them in to help shape policies in the future.So last point I want to make is to specifically call out Brian and the staff of our commission and of the Society Department for the terrific work they did. I think they've craft the best policy I've ever seen, and I encourage you all to endorse it here tonight.Thank you.Thank you. Thanks again. And you guys you guys did a great job. And don't forget this community. We have these amazing commissioners who are volunteers who are working on this stuff for us every single day, and we're very grateful.So, Councilmember Pierce.Yes, I just wanted to, you know, thank Rob for his work on the commission, but also really thank you, Mayor. I know whenever you were elected, transparency and open government was something that was a key part of coming on.So I wanted to clarify this would also include our PD to our police department as well.Yes. This includes data that is available through the city. Whether it's any specific department, all data would be available as as it goes forward.Okay. Thank you so much.Great. Thank you. There's a motion in a second. See no other public comment. Please cast your votes.Motion carries.Great. Now we're going to here real quickly.Item 12.\nReasoning:Reasoning:",

I look forward to working with both of you. Okay. Let's go to agenda item number three and please read the short title.Engine item three, cancel 119 357 relating to the sale of lots one, two, three and four of block seven in the Latin edition to the City of Seattle Committee recommend civil pass.Jasper and Beck show.You this is a sale of property over on Burr Gilman next to Dun Dun Lumber. It is a 15,000 square foot property that is known as the Brickyard and it has a sales price of not less than $2.575 million.It is in an area that is zoned industrial. I see 45. The possibility of residential uses there have been eliminated simply because of the zoning. And I would just want to say council members want your legislative aide came to my office this afternoon and asked if there was a reason why the money could not go back intothe housing fund. And the answer is, is that when the property was purchased, it was purchased with gas tax fund moneys that must go back into the Transportation Department. So I just want you to know that we did look into it.We did ask that question. And if this is approved and the transfer is completed today, the receipts that the city Department of Transportation receives will go back into as stock money and into their funds. So there has been great community support for this.I just want to acknowledge that at my meeting last week, we had members of the Neighborhood Cascade Bicycle Club, the pedestrian organization Feet First were there just to support this. And we really appreciate the visuals that we saw from Dunn Lumber with the idea that it will be part of the neighborhood.It will tie itself into Burke Gilman, that people will be invited to come in, use the facilities, and just it will be a real neighborhood asset. At the same time, it expands some space for that company that is very important to the Wallingford neighborhood.So we recommend that this purchase and sale proceed.Very good. Any questions or comments? Customer I'm a skater.Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to say thank you to Chair Bagshaw for her work on this and for her staff and central staff's willingness to answer the various questions that I had. One of the issues that you've heard us continually talk about this year is the ability to keep public land in public hands and buildhousing on it. This is the question that we look forward to asking for every parcel of land as soon as we're able to hopefully pass the disposition policy here soon. Here's a great example where our city departments did ask that question, and the answer was, we cannot build housing on this relatively small plot of land.It is not zoned for housing. It is not zoned for mixed use, and thus we cannot put housing above it. And given the size of this lot, it makes sense to continue to allow done lumber to expand their production there in this industrial area, to promote good living wage jobs in this area and make sure that we'reconnecting the community. I really appreciated that. Even though we don't have the ability to build housing here, the vision, the model that has been outlined for us includes, as Councilmember Bagshaw just mentioned, the use of a public space on the ground floor so that we're connecting the trail to community space there.And so I'm really looking forward to how we partner more with organizations that are interested in this trail oriented development, as they called it, so that we can get more individuals of all ages, ethnicities, languages, races, genders, abilities, using the Burke Gilman connecting our community to public assets like the ones that we already have down there onthe north end of Lake Union and the ones that are soon coming. So I will be a yes in support of this legislation.Thank you.Thank you. Coach Marion Johnson.I won't repeat the excellent points made by both of my previous colleagues, but just want to say thank you to the folks from the Department of Transportation Affairs and in particular the folks representing the Dunn family and the Dunn family themselves.First learned about this project about four years ago, and it's taken us a little while to get to this point. But we're glad to be here and excited to see a project that has such strong commitment from so many different diverse stakeholders move forward.Excellent customer.GONZALEZ Thank you. Just to join the chorus here, I also wanted to take a moment to recognize the good work done on the efforts here. I think this is a good example of what happens when we do have surplus land and we have a property owner excuse me, a a purchaser of the property who has really gonegone above and beyond to do the necessary community outreach to make sure that folks in the neighborhood understand why it's going to be repurposed for X, Y, Z purposes. And so I want to commend the folks over at Dunn Lumber for the good work you all did to do some of the hard work and lifting around makingsure that the Wallingford community really understood what the project meant and what the scope would be. And so I just want to thank you all for for that and also for briefing me personally about, I think, a year ago already at this point to make sure that we understood in our office exactly what was going to bedone on this parcel of land and also all the work that had already been done in terms of community outreach. So kudos to you all for having a very smooth process and really look forward to seeing the end result.I think it's going to be a huge contribution to this part of part of the city. So thank you.Thank you for those words. Okay.

The property is known as the Brickyard and is located on Burr Gilman next to Dunn Lumber. The property is in an industrial area and cannot be used for residential purposes due to zoning restrictions.

You are the chair of this committee and are recognized once again to provide the committee's report on this bill. Thank you very much, Madam President.Collins. Item. Item number four on today's agenda. We talked about quite a bit this morning. This is related to the federal grants that we are accepting. There's a number of important federal grants that are accepted at the end of the year each year.There has been a document that was circulated this weekend by Greg Doss from central staff. And we appreciate all of the work that they did over the weekend to help answer questions that stemmed from the robust discussion in our committee meeting on Wednesday.One of the things that you should also note, in addition to the questions that we have submitted that resulted in 11 page response document, is that Director Noble has sent a letter today to make sure that if there are any additional questions that those get answered before those 2021 allocations are spent.And that's an important commitment from the CBO office, from Director Noble, that he has sent this letter to us, which you all should have received just around 2 p.m. today, to make sure that any additional questions specifically as well related to Homeland Security grants do get answered.As the council member, Strauss discussed this morning. There was a long conversation in Wednesday on Wednesday's meeting, and I do have additional concerns and questions that I will be submitting. Folks are asked by Alex Nucci and Greg Doss that if you do have additional questions that are not yet answered in that 11 page document, please make surethat you send your questions by Wednesday at noon so that central staff can coordinate with the office to answer any additional questions. I want to make sure, though, as Vice-Chair Herbal did during our committee last year, that folks know that there's a number of really important grants that are included in the overall bill as well, and wewant to make sure to move this forward to accept those grants. With that, I will be voting yes and the committee voted 5 to 0, recommending passage during full council today. Thank you very much, Madam President. And you consider our musketeer for that excellent report while multitasking.Well done. Are there any additional comments on the bill? Councilmember Strauss and then Councilor, you want to go to Councilmember first? Okay. Councilmember Herbold and then Councilmember Strauss.Thank you. I also want to make note of Budget Director Ben Noble's commitment in the Budget Committee meeting to do more work with the Council prior to the the development and submittal of grants that may be of concern to the Council.An example of the work that this Council has done around funding sources that are of concern relates specifically to legislation in 2017 that the Council adopted. You might remember that that year I proposed to create a new section of the municipal code prohibiting Seattle Police Department participation in the U.S. Department of Defense 1033 program that allows citiesto transfer excess military equipment to civilian law enforcement agencies at no cost. This was a particular program that we had received concerns about, and in response, we, the chief, had had decided to no longer participate in that program.And then we sort of solidified that policy decision of of of chief best with this with this particular ordinance, I would suggest that our ongoing efforts to take a look at some of these grant sources might result in a request from the council to the department to no longer participate in in some of these grant sources.But I think that is really important work, and I appreciate that that we need to do moving forward. And I appreciate that we have a commitment from the Budget Director that we can take a deeper dove in the future before these grants are sought.Thank you.Oh, excellent. Thank you. Councilmember Herbold, Councilmember Strauss.Thank you, Council President. Thank you, Chairman Skater. And thank you. Also Chair Herbold. Also want to thank Director Noble for your letter. Your letter, as well as the conversation that I had with Greg Doss and Alex Nucci, have resolved the concerns that I have for today.And I will be following up with additional questions as per your letter has requested. I really just want to thank you, Director Noble, for sending that along and working with us in an expedient fashion as well. Again, a thank you to Dr. Fisher and Angela Sochi and Greg, for all of your work answering the 11 pages ofquestions over the weekend. Thank you, council president. I will be voting yes. Thank you.Now way to bury the lead counselor with Strauss. Thank you so much. Colleagues, are there any additional comments on the bill? Right. Hearing non-whites want to thank the chair and member Strauss and conservatives for their good work on getting as much information about this as we can.Lots more to always, particularly as it relates to oversight issues.

Mayor EDI and committee has been very active this year. We have worked with local businesses to address many of the things that may be hindering them from both locating in and growing in Long Beach. Both Councilmember Price and myself advocated for local businesses along the campaign trail, along with many of my colleagues.And this is us following through with a pilot program to see what initiative programs are most beneficial to both growing our local Long Beach businesses and encouraging others to come here.

And so with that, I appreciate the Economic Development Finance Committee's work and the work of our finance office and the city manager's office. These are creative solutions during hard economic times that we hope will be productive, and we will review their progress and then come back to this board with additional recommendations.Councilwoman.Is it?

That was the other item.Well, I just want to thank her anyway, because.She.Does a lot of work. Hello. And the city manager for really helping make this concept a reality. When we started off with the idea of coming up with some small business incentives, we had talked about trying to waive business license fees for the first year.And when the figures came back in terms of what that would do to our general fund, it was it was shocking that the figure was very high and definitely not something that we could incorporate into our budget given our current fiscal climate and our future fiscal climate.So when I spoke with the city manager, I asked him to really help me come up with some creative solutions where we can start with some basic preliminary steps to incentivize and encourage small businesses, business growth and opportunities within our city.And he did just that with the help of Jon GROSS. So I want to thank you for coming together with coming up with this incentive package and for allowing us an opportunity to show our business community that we are, in fact, business friendly and we are doing our very best.Given the current fiscal climate, to give them as many breaks as we can when they choose us as a partner, and hopefully in the future, as the economy gets better, we'll be able to do more. But these are some baby steps that we hope will help the businesses that fall into these four categories continue to grow andthrive in our city. So thank you.Thank you.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nRecommendation to award a contract for the publication of legal notices to the Alameda Journal for fiscal year 20 1718.Remember. Did you want to share this?Sure. Thank you, Madam Mayor. I guess the reason I put this will one to have a discussion, because I think we had a discussion last year on this and it was too late to include a competitive bid from the Alameda Sun and.You know, we received and then we have a copy of this up here correspondence from the Alameda Sun that question the. Question the verified audit. So I wonder if if staff could clarify, because I think we do have an updated letter from the Journal.That says their audit is 18,000 and the letter from the Sun alleges that is 23,000 plus. So maybe we can have some explanation on the difference on those two numbers. And if it makes a difference in our and our bid.Bidding process.Well, I can I can respond to part of that. First of all, the way it works for legal newspapers is it's part of the government code that talks about what a legal newspaper is. And they have to be adjudicated by a court that they meet the requirements of the government code to be a newspaper of general circulation. There are a couple of tests. Frankly, the audit is not part of those tests. So the Alameda Journal many years ago, I think it was 1992, I have it here in my file actually was adjudicated as a newspaper of general circulation.So eligible then to be considered by the city to to get that contract. The son had not been. The sun now is the sun also has received from from the municipal court an adjudication that they too are a newspaper of general circulation.Our charter requires that annually the city clerk put out a request for bids and solicit bids from.Adjudicated newspapers to submit what you.Have before you and the and then to award the contract to the lowest responsive bidder. And so that is what the staff report shows. The city clerk did it, did that. I don't if you want to add anything here, Laura, but appreciating the comments from the sun.But frankly, none of them are relevant to the fact that a court has adjudicated a journal to be a newspaper that is eligible for this. And the process would be for the Sun to petition the court if they believe that any information they might have could affect that adjudicated result.Is there any other?Are we? I'm thinking minimum. Are we obligated to go with the lowest bidder?That's what the charter says.It does say that.Charter.Charter Section three Dash 18 says the Council shall annually after advertising in the manner provided for the purchase of.Supplies, which is the bidding.Process award a contract to the responsible bidder who.Submits the lowest and best bid for publication of legal.Advertising in the city for a newspaper adjudicated to be a newspaper of general circulation within the city. You are allowed to reject all bids.But you have to give it to the charter.Responsible bidder who.Submits the lowest and best bid for publication.Is there a definition of the word best? I mean.No, sir. That's what the charter says.Oh, okay.Okay. So. In regards that lowest and best does best give us some opening in regards to evaluate you know in evaluating beyond just the lowest.If you believe there is some finding.That you can make that makes one of them.Better than the other. When they're both adjudicated legal newspapers and have the capability and they have and responded with prices. I the council can discuss that.On their member matters.I would submit to the Council that the local ownership and local operation of Tell Me the Sun qualifies it as being the best.And I think I would add to that that there's speculation locally based on the audited numbers is actually higher.So two points. So I make two. We make a motion to accept their bid over at the Journal.Yes. We'll do it with the findings that you part of your motion should be those findings that you just stated, which is why it is the best since it's not the lowest.So I move that in evaluation of the bids, it was determined that they are in the sun by virtue of its higher circulation and its local ownership qualifies as the best and should be awarded the contract for legal notices for the City of Armenia.Second Vice Mayor. Thought I heard.Yeah. I mean, I think rather than just say that it's got a higher circulation, I would like to clarify for the record how much higher I mean, the prices are. Daniel. A different voice. I would like to at least clarify that for the record.So and I appreciate that there's a motion a second. One thing that I had heard discussed was possibly looking at six months and six months of each, if that was a possibility, and I don't know if council would entertain such a thing.Nebraska, I have a question which was in this staff report on the. So it talks about the cost. The city spends approximately $18,000 annually for legal notices, of which approximately 4000 is from the general fund. Awarding the contract to the Alameda Sun would cause the costs to triple.So remind me. Is that the general fund portion triples from 4 to 12000, but then each department's budget has to cover the rest.Yes. So the total costs instead of 18,000 would be closer to 60,000. And it would be spread between departments who use it and also the general fund portion, which is. Now a quarter of that. And.I'm vice.Mayor. What departments typically use this primarily planning?So I'd like to make a friendly ask if you would consider a friendly amendment to the motion to actually consider to have six months and six months of each of them actually thinks all people get one or the other.Not necessarily both in my neighborhood. I don't know who was mentioned. That was sorry. I think it was never Odie. Sorry. Sorry. Um. Member matter. I see.I can't I can't split my determination of what's best and worth essentially $40,000 in local investment. So I don't think I'll accept that amendment.Forget about you proposing me.Well, I was suggesting some people had actually suggested to me that we consider looking at six months and six months. But the reason was that some people get one and some people get the other that many neighborhoods don't get both newspapers.From my understanding, I know. In my neighborhood. That's true. And.I don't see the logic of that. I mean, maybe I missed the thing, but.I have one other question. People are saying that the sun has higher circulation than the journal. I don't see those numbers either in the staff report and I've asked for clarification on that or in the in the letters that I've received.You want the exact numbers?Yes.Where? Where is that?We're being told it's substantially more so. Okay.Let me let me just pull it for you.I thought.Okay. I've got it.Not in this email, though.It's not me.I need.The number included in the Suns bid and. Is the total is 23,500 is 175 and free is 22,000 930. And then this urinal can observe.Can you learn which.Yeah, sure.Okay. Got it. So this is for the sun first and their total that they say is 23,500. And of those, 22,930 are free. Circulation, free circulation and paid circulation is 175.And numbers for the Journal, huh?There are no. Hard to see.Sorry. Two more.Lines. Okay.They're small.4471.What was the number?3471? Although I believe their letter says something different than what they've 18,000, 18,000 tonight. So I think I'm looking at the wrong thing all the. Okay. Wait, I was thinking.I've got to go further.I have like a whole.Thing of all of their.Yeah, that one. I'm sure that letter has arrived, but the 18,000 number? Yeah. I can't.Imagine. I have 18.

As a sponsor of this resolution, I will speak to it. I did speak to it yesterday as well on what some of the reasons of how we got how we got here. And then when I'm done, I'll open it up for comments.On April 28, the Governance, Native Communities and Tribal Governments Committee recommended Resolution 32051 unanimously. I spoke to this briefly in committee and of course yesterday the resolution amends the council rules to do the following. Number one, make some technical clarifications.Number two, adds guidance to the use of the consent calendar. This amendment would allow the consent calendar to include administrative items where there is no debate. It also allows for any item on the consent calendar to be removed by any particular council member that would like it removed for any further discussion.Third, it clarifies the rule regarding abstentions. This change would relieve the Council president from making the determination on which resolutions to allow for abstentions. Indeed, it would fall upon the individual council member to determine if something is directly related or material in either vote or abstain as as deemed fit.So with that, as I did share and I, I believe Ali may be available, but I'm pretty sure you all had your questions answered. Ali did great analysis for us in a memo. And I want to thank Councilmember Peterson working with me on this and some of you other folks that weighed in kind of offline about whatsome of the issues were.

Conclude the public hearing and adopt a resolution amending the master fee and charges schedule citywide.Thank you. If required. I see. Mr. Modica. Thank you, Vice Mayor. The staff report will be given by John GROSS, our finance director. Good evening, Vice Mayor and members of council. This is a public hearing and an item where we're recommending midyear changes to the master fee and charges schedule the master fee and charges schedule the mainone normally comes before does come before council each year at the budget time and that's when almost all of the normal changes are made. We have a mid-year adjustment in. What you're seeing in front of you is a small number of changes for mid-year adjustments so that we don't have to wait until the budget budget time andthis never mind this year. Some of the items included include aligning fees to the cost of services, reducing airline fees consistent with the business model for the airport and the increased traffic at the airport and then passing on some fees that are have been added by the state.And that concludes the staff report. And we're ready for any questions. Thank you. Any public comment on this item? See? None. There is a motion. Can we get a second on this?It's been seconded.It's not showing up here on the second here. Hold on. Actually, madam, quickly, we switch the screen to the.We all have it.Yeah, I know. It's not coming up here. Hold on one. Okay. There's a motion in a second. There's no public comment on this item. I'm assuming the staff report was already read. Great. Please cast your votes.I have some comment.Please. Councilman Price.Okay. Thank you. So, on this item, this was a ten page report, the master fee schedule. And I want to specifically acknowledge the great work of my chief of staff, Jack Cunningham. Every Sunday night, we send an email out to our residents of what's coming to council.And he actually did pull out something on page eight that relates to future implementation of parking meters in a commercial area in my district on page eight. So I want to thank him for doing that. There are a couple of changes I'd like to make to the recommendation here.Would this be an appropriate time to do so? Mr. GROSS Oh, actually, if Mr. Beck is available, I have a question about it.That would be great.Thank you.Mr.. And yes, this would be the appropriate time for changes.Thank you, sir. Mr. Beck. I wanted to ask you, what is the justification for a public works recommendation regarding parking meters on Ocean Boulevard between Termino and Bennett?So I think you're referring to the feed that's in the masterpiece schedule for $0.75 an hour for the parking meters there. Yes. In connection with another item that's on the agenda tonight. And so like any of our business districts where we see a lot of demand for parking, which also happens frequently in our coastal areas, not onlyin Long Beach, but in many coastal cities that you provide parking meters in those areas to encourage turnover so that businesses can see their patrons have parking opportunities.So in regard to this particular item, if I wanted to make some changes to the proposed fee schedule and the projection revenue projections and use thereof, would this be an appropriate time to do it, or am I going to do that at a fit with another agenda item?I think we would focus on the next agenda item that talks about the parking meters and the parking rates and that, of course, and we would make any adjustments there. And depending on how the attorney wants to handle this, we can we can make that adjustment now or we can come back or pull that one item offthe masterpiece schedule. Mr. Attorney, if you have some recommendations.Mr. May, that I would concur that it'd be great to really have that discussion for the next item. If we're able to do so.We can delay that until the next item and we can.Conform the.Result to the master fee resolution because the Masterpiece Resolution can't exceed or be below what you approve on that.Item. That's perfect. Thank you.Great. So we'll take that as the motion then. And there is there is a second on that motion as well. Members, please go ahead and cast your votes and let's. Vice Mayor, you wanted to add something? All right, please cast your vote.Motion carries.Thank you. I think there's a lot of folks here for the power steering items, so I want to do that next.

We've had a couple of requests are going to do those first two out of 29/1.Communication from Councilman Austin recommendation to receive and file a presentation from the Rivers and Mountains Conservancy on the progress of the Lower Los Angeles River Revitalization Plan.Mr. Austin.Thank you. As you know, ab5 30 created by a speaker renting created a lower L.A. River revitalization group that myself, Amir Garcia, are part of in terms of representing Long Beach. But there are several other cities along the lower L.A. rivers.And the working group has been working very, very diligently over the past several months to get to a place where we can have a great revitalization plan. And we've asked Mark Stanley, the executive director of the Rivers and Mountains Conservancy, to come here today to give us a presentation.I think you will all be wowed. Thank you, Mark.Thank you. And Mr. Turnbull, Mayor Garcia, vice mayor, members of the council as mentioned, and Mark Stanley from the Rivers and Mountains Conservancy. I'm here tonight in the capacity of leading the group, the plenty effort that's taken place for the Lower Los Angeles River.I serve in many other capacities, which many of you know me by as well. The lowland L.A. River Revitalization Revitalization Plan is an effort to facilitate collaborative management of the watershed and make the river more accessible to the community a more accessible community resource.The planning process will lay the groundwork for revitalizing revitalizing the L.A. River and for improving our community connection to the river. I'm going to. Briefly. Oh, there we go. I'm going to provide a brief presentation on the activities that have been taking place through the planning process of the working group.I'm having a. Oh, there we go. Oh, there we go. I think we have a slight delay with the clicker. And I'm going to start off with the organizations that help to implement this process. It started with AB 530, which was introduced by Assemblyman Rendon.He was not the speaker at the time. As we all know, he is now the Speaker of the Assembly. He introduced legislation to create a working group for the lower half of the Los Angeles fervor. In that legislation, it outlined that the Rivers and Mountains Conservancy would staff the organization, and it would be an update of theLos Angeles County Master Plan for the lower half of the Los Angeles River, a plan that was originally created back in 1996. So the planning process. Well, that slide. Okay. There we go. The schedule has been such that we began in back in the fall of 2016.We're going through a three stage process. We're going to be concluding pretty soon. And we also have some community engagement involved in this, which I'll speak on towards the end of the presentation. So our first phase of the project was to gather input from the community, form the working group and engage the community in this process.The second stage has been to take some of those ideas that have been generated from community members and working group members and to start develop concepts. We're now in the final stage of the process. We're going to be drafting the plan and we'll do a final adoption after the first of the year.In terms of the structure of the program, we have a working group and I'll show you how many members are really involved in that process. We also have consultants that come in. They serve as technical resources to this process and provide us information on other activities that are taking place along the river corridor as well as thetributaries. We have a robust program where we reach out to the community and there's lots of community members who participate in this process as well. The members of the Working Group, 40 members strong, including the Rivers and Mountains Conservancy, includes all the cities along the lower half of the Los Angeles River.When I speak of the lower half of the Los Angeles forever, I'm talking from the City of Vernon down to your great city of Long Beach, and also includes many of the cities that are on the tributaries as well.We have two major tributaries, the Rio Hondo River, as well as the Compton Creek. Because of the size of the working group, we have divided up into a number of committees. One of those formats is for us to divide up into segments, and those segments are the upper middle and lower reach of the lower half of theriver, the upper reach being above Rio Hondo, the Middle Bay between Vero Hondo and Compton Creek and Compton Creek down to the ocean. We also have plan element committees, the plan element committees, which I'll talk a little bit more about.It's structured such that the months that the River segment committees don't meet, we meet with the plan element committees. We want to maintain community participation throughout all this activity. As you see, community engagement takes place throughout the planning process.Committee Economic and Health and Equity Committee. A lot of that focus has been on gentrification and displacement. Topics as well as homeless support of our businesses and our work for workforce to increase equity among our community members and promote wellness and physical activity as well.We're also taking on aspects of how we can green the river corridor. As most of you know, it's mostly a concrete channel. We're looking at ways that we can enhance connectivity to the river, create public spaces, and enhance the experience that people have when they go along the L.A. River.Our Water and Environment Committee focuses a lot on flood management. One of the things that we don't want to do as we move forward through this planning process is compromise the flood protection that the cities enjoy today. As a matter of fact, we want to strengthen that flood protection.That is why we have a separate committee just to talk about water elements alone, how we can improve the flow of that water, how we can improve water quality to habitat biodiversity along the waterway as well. I spoke community engagement.It is built very much in this planning process. It is one of the chief elements for the formation of the working group. I'm going to talk a little bit more about that after this slide. I mentioned that we're in the third phase of the planning process.We're now starting to build those signature projects that will serve as examples of how we can provide enhancements along the lower half of the of the river, which will feed into an overall master plan for the entire 51 miles of the Los Angeles forever, a process that's beginning to take place.As we wrap up this work under the working group. So community engagement activities, a big part of what we're what we've been doing is engaging the community. We want to pull ideas from the community of what they like to see.Along the lower half of the river. We've had many presentations out in the community and we're continuing those throughout this month and into the early part of next month as well. We've had bike rides to engage people in different ways, as well as trail activities where we can engage in question.Community pop up activities is where we don't organize the events, but the community events that have taken place that we actually go out and participate in those events and provide some information about the planning activity that's taking place.We've held a number of workshops. We have a questionnaire that's online. I'll provide you that website at the end of this presentation. We have a newsletter and as I mentioned, the working group meetings. We have one that's coming up on Thursday, the first Thursday of every month, and they start at 6:00.Kickoff events, community workshops. I spoke up. This is just a couple of pictures of those activities that have already taken place, equestrian activities, the pop up events where we go to other community activities that are taking place throughout the cities along the lower half of the river.The movie night was a tremendously successful event. We were able to provide that activity down in the channel of the river, a place that community does not typically get access to. Even though we have not implemented any of the plans that we're talking about.You can see that there was a tremendous response from the community in wanting to participate in activities along the Los Angeles River. Some of the events that are coming. Up, as I mentioned, the working group. It's going to be in the city of Downey this Thursday.They rotate among the cities along the lower half of the Los Angeles River. We've been into the city of Long Beach, I believe, twice through this process. And I believe in November. We'll be back again. On October the seventh, we're going to have another bike tour.And actually every weekend in October, we're having bike tours that start at different points along the lower half of the river. It will continue to be engaged in pop up events throughout the city, along the river as well.I mentioned at the end of the presentation, I will provide you that website. That website contains all the information that I just talked about. In addition to detailing notes that have come out of each of the working group meetings that provide you information about all the activities that are coming up past activities.And it allows you to take a survey to provide additional input into this process. I thank you for inviting us here tonight. And that concludes my presentation. Thank you, Mark. And we're going to go ahead and continue. But once I'm sure it is, back over to First Councilman Austin.Give me a round of applause.Thank you and thank you, Mark, for that great presentation. And I just would just implore upon the residents who had an opportunity to see this, those watching at home to come out and participate in the community engagement models that are that are happening, because this is an opportunity for you to weigh in and be engaged in somethingthat is going to be truly transformational along the the L.A. River, the lower half of the L.A. River, as well as the upper half of the L.A. River. It's an important project that the City of Long Beach is engaged in.And again, there will be some significant changes, changes that will will improve access safety. But overall, just just the importance of having a river in our city. And so I'm looking forward to to the vision being actually implemented.A lot of these meetings have been, you know, pretty tedious. And we've been really, really, you know, working hard to take in the input of everybody who has given input from those who would then question interest, those with the know recreational interests, those who want to see our water cleaner.And so this is this is, like I said, an opportunity to really change the game with the L.A. River and again, invite you all to participate. Thank you again for your great work. Mark.Thank you. Next replay of Councilmember Pearce.Yes. I want to thank you, Mark, for coming and sharing with us. I think the partnership that you guys have created along the entire river was going to get us to to see our vision through. And it's really exciting to think about places where we've had rivers that have been rehabbed.And really you're taking in all the animals and the wildlife as well as urban setting. It can be really exciting. And I just want to thank you guys for the work and think Councilmember Austin as well. Appreciate it.Thank you. Councilmember Elanga.Thank you, Barry. I also want to add my congratulations to Mr. Stanley. I worked with him on the Rivers and Mounds Conservancy, as well as with the Los Amigos Wetlands Authority. We has had a grand opening this coming Saturday, this past Saturday, opening up a new trail system along the lottery with wetlands.And he does some great work. He's he's surely a champion of not only protecting our wildlife, but also enhancing the opportunities for people to enjoy the river. And I also want to congratulate the rivers of mouth conservative, which which Mr. Stanley is the executive director of with the Long Beach must grant that was given the goal waswhat $2.3 million with up.To.25 million.To.2000002 million I wish it was 25 that went to towards developing also some urban wetlands along the river with the language arts program. So thank you for your presentation. Thank you for all your work.Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thank you, Councilman Austin, for scheduling this presentation. And Mr. Stanley, thank you for your hard work on this. I know that this is one of the biggest opportunities we have along the river. You know, what's interesting is our river runs adjacent to a freeway and runs adjacent to some of the most economicallyand environmentally impacted areas of L.A. County. And the improvement in the focus on the river really is a big opportunity for us to talk about environmental justice and talk about economic justice in areas that really haven't had that that sort of investment.I'm really excited that that you are doing this. Level of outreach. I was able to participate in the meeting at the Michelle Obama Neighborhood Library in North Long Beach, as well as I know that there's a lot of discussion with the college about sort of the Long Beach Compton border, the intersection of the 91 and the seventhin the L.A. River. And I want to see continue to see more conversations about, you know, elevating that as a major area of focus for many communities that really surround that that that intersection of of infrastructure. So thank you can continue to count on our support and I look forward to continuing engage in this process.Thanks a lot.Thank you. Councilwoman Pierce. Actually, she spoke. Councilwoman Price.Thank you. Happens at every meeting. I just.Wanted to.Congratulate you, Mark, on. I know there.Have been new resources that.Have been infused into several of the organizations that you are in charge of leading. And I know that I too have the the pleasure of working with you as the chair of the Los Cerritos Wetlands Authority. And I think it should everyone on on our council should know if they don't already that you are probably one ofthe busiest men out there in terms of wetlands restorations and sort of preserve it in terms of preserving natural habitats and environmentally sensitive areas.

Recommendation to award a contract to enterprise fleet management for leasing vehicles for various police operations in an annual amount not to exceed $155,000 citywide.Is there a staff report, Mr. City Manager?Yes, we have a brief staff report from our fleet manager, Dan Perlmutter. Good evening. Over the years, the police department has used a variety of procurement options to secure vehicles for undercover operations, and we are jointly working to renew that fleet, which has aged considerably.The undercover fleet is currently a mix of leased and city owned assets and this is proven effective in meeting the department's operational needs. This proposal is a continuation of a leasing program initiated for the Department in 2011. The police department has factors unique to their operations and under certain circumstances, may need to take a vehicle out ofservice and replace it with very short notice. Staff researched options for quick and efficient vehicle swap out services and determined that leasing a small portion of vehicles for these operations would satisfy the department's operational need. Lucent provides the option to quickly swap out a vehicle for a like unit, along with minimal administrative delay.Additionally, since the current police undercover vehicle fleet is aging and becoming unreliable, maintenance costs and downtime have been rising significantly. What should be a simple Preventive Maintenance Service has turned into extended visits to the repair shop, as entire vehicle systems have to be replaced or rebuilt.Vehicle availability has been reduced, affecting police operations. This lease option will enable a near term replacement of the most troublesome vehicles, leading to immediate savings in maintenance and fuel costs and an improved level of service to the to support department operations.At this time, city staff recommend securing a limited number of vehicles for undercover operations through leasing. This will assist the police department by providing for a quick vehicle swap out if needed and replacement of their most agent vehicles in the near term.This contract provides for lease of up to 20 vehicles of various makes and models for an annual amount not to exceed $155,000 for a period of four years. Extensive local outreach was done for this bid. However, a nationwide leasing firm enjoys significant advantages in purchasing power and access to capital.Fleet will be returning to council with recommendations to replace the remainder of the undercover fleet through a series of new and used vehicle purchases, which is the most cost effective procurement method for the majority of that fleet. That concludes my presentation.I'm happy to address any questions of counsel.Thank you. Councilmember Andrews, would you like to? Wonderful. Councilman Austin. No, thank you. Is there any member of the public that wishes to address the Council on item 15? Seeing nonmembers cast your vote.You're welcome.Motion passes nine zero.\nReasoning:Reasoning:",

Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nWe do have two proclamations this evening, and we'll start with the first one. Proclamation 866. Councilman Lopez, will you please read proclamation 866 will do.Mr. President. Proclamation number 866 series of 2014, celebrating Denver after school programs and the 15th Annual National Lights on after school day. Whereas the Denver City Council is is committed to quality afterschool programs and the opportunities they provide children and youth engaging and challenging them through learning experiences that help develop their social, emotional, physical and academic skills. In addition to supporting working families by ensuring their children are safe and productive after the regular school day ends. And.

And.Whereas, the city and county of Denver, the Denver Afterschool Alliance, Denver Public Schools and many of Denver's funding and community based organizations work together to develop a sustainable citywide afterschool system to increase access to and participation in quality afterschool programs for all of Denver's.Youth.In order to keep kids safe, inspire them to learn and prepare them for the future. And. Whereas, Denver is home to over 93,000 school age youth, producing a significant need for afterschool programs to support their academic, social and physical development.And we're as lights on afterschool a national celebration of afterschool programs on October 23rd, 2014 highlights the critical importance of quality afterschool programs in the lives of children, their families and their communities.

Thursday, October 23rd, 2014. Section two that the Clerk of the of the city and county of Denver shall test and affix the seal of the city and county Denver to this proclamation.And. Transmit it to the Office of Education and Children.Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Your motion to adopt.I move that proclamation number 866 series of 2014 be adopted.It has been moved and second it comments from members of council councilman lopez.Thank you, Mr. President. It is a delight to be able to read this proclamation, but to do it in front of these beautiful kids who are sitting in our council chambers. And if you take notice. They're all sitting up front.Not one space is empty. And the front row and any of these are us. And they come from all over Denver for Emanuel High from West High School, which is my personal favorite. From South, even though she's wearing a cowboy orange from D.C., she's from Greenlee.Where were you from? I forgot. And this is Fairmont. Right. So they are kids from all over the place. And these after school programs are essential. They're essential because nowadays families work and they're working one or two jobs and they're switching off back and forth.And they're essential also because these kids just love homework and they love school and they just cannot get enough of it. And they even told me, perhaps we should pass an ordinance that creates more homework. Right. Didn't you guys told me that?Oh, yeah. Oh, okay. Well.It might have been the opposite. It might have been the opposite. It might have been the opposite where I was being lobbied really hard since they were here. So we know that we won't pass that ordinance, but it is amazing.It's a great program. The city has been a member of the Denver Afterschool Alliance for a long time, already under the leadership of MAXINE Quintana, who's in the Mayor's Office of Education and Children and DPS. And I'll have John Albright come up here, along with Enrique Garcia, who's a a young, young man and a participant in theBoys and Girls Club activities. So without further ado, I'd like to have them come up afterwards, um, to, to get this proclamation after we do the vote.So thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilman Brooks.Thank you, Mr. President. And and thanks to Councilman Lopez for bringing this forward. You know, I say this time and time again, but the most important work that we can do in this city is with these with these young folks.And you're looking at our future city right now. And it is a distinct pleasure and honor to have you guys here in this building. I know you're bored out of your minds, but we need we, as decision makers and policymakers, need to continually be reminded of of what's the most important asset in our city.And that's you guys. And yeah, you know, I'm so supportive of this and I hope that we can continue to work with DPS and work with other stakeholders in other sectors, business sector, to to figure out how we can continue to make our afterschool programs a little bit more robust and interesting and diverse for all of thedifferent needs that we have in the community. We know that we're cutting many different programs within our educational system, especially the arts. And we know that the arts is what engages our young people. Right, and shows them like, wow, this is this is what I was created for.I was born to do this. And all of a sudden they start seeing their grades go up because they're engaged and they're ready to go and they have a vision for life. And so I hope that we can continue to invest in that, and I hope that we can continue to support programs like that.And I hope you guys are reading your shirt and you're reading it deeply because each of you matter and man, you're beautiful, godly, good looking kids. But we appreciate you. We support you.Thank you. Councilmember Councilwoman Sheppard.Thank you. I remember fondly when I was a little girl that I participated in Girls Club programing, and it was really I just remember it being really fun and really cool and I really looked forward to it and I looked forward to participating.So I really support the programing. And then later, as an adult, when my son was born, I did a lot of volunteering in the after school program at Lake IB. They have an after school gardening program and we worked to help get vegetable and flower beds built there so that the kids could participate and learn how togrow some of their own food, which they later used to sell in a farmer's market program at the school. And like got to learn how to start a business and learn some entrepreneurial skills about marketing and interacting with customers and customer service.And I think that that the skills that children can be exposed to and learn in these afterschool programs really go, you know, above and beyond what might be taught in the curriculum at school. And I sort of want to echo what Councilman Brooks was saying, is that with all the cuts to our education systems, so much ofthe the core curriculum is really being narrowed into very specific bands of learning. And through the after school programs, I think you can really get exposed to, you know, a whole range of things that you might not have the opportunity to learn about.During your regular school days. So I'm a huge fan and very supportive of the programing and of this proclamation. Thank you so much, Councilman Lopez, for bringing it forward.Then Councilwoman Schaeffer. Councilman Lopez, you have another comment? You know.I forgot to mention something and the reason why and I further mention the reason why there was sit in the front and there was a particular reason why they did. And I think we had a little discussion earlier, and they they realize that there's so many people around this world, so many kids their age in this worldthat would do anything at risk their lives to do anything just so that they can come have an opportunity to learn and to be at their same schools. And I don't think they'd be sitting in the back now, would we?It'd be sitting up in front. And there are so many people who fought throughout our history so that they could sit in the front and not the back. And I, I think I heard them say something about I mean, I asked them where they were going to sit when they were going to go to college.And I forgot, what are you guys going to sit in the front? Were they not going to sit by? And when they go back to Greenly, where are they going to go in the front? So I wanted to provide some context.I'm just blown away by these kids. And you're right, Councilman, we are going to have a bright future with these children. So thank you.Thank you. Councilman Lopez, do we have any other comments from members of council seen on Madam Secretary, roll call.LOPEZ Hi.Montero. NEVITT Hi, Rob. Shepherd Hi. SUSSMAN Hi. BROOKS Hi. Brown. I thought I can eat. Lemon Ortega. Mr. President.Hi. Councilman Ortega. Madam Secretary, please close the voting and now the results. 3939. 866 has been adopted. Councilman Lopez, is there someone you like to come to the podium to receive the proclamation? Yeah.Two amazing individuals I like that have come up. One is John Albright, who was co-chair of the Denver After-School Alliance and from DPS school district number one. And then also Enrique Garcia, who a participant in the Boys and Girls Club activities.And Cesar headed to what's cool. USC, right? Yeah, USC. All right.Good. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Thank you. City council. And want to express just a few words of appreciation for on behalf of the school district and also the Denver Afterschool Alliance board for the city council, the mayor, Mayor Hancock support and the support of Denver residents for the work we're doing across the city to improve the qualityand access to very high quality afterschool programs for all of Denver's youth. So, Councilman Lopez, you know, piggyback a little bit on what you said they were telling me earlier. They're coming to the school board Thursday night and they're advocating for a policy for more homework for for at the board level.So maybe we'll be hearing more about that. I think everybody's really excited. So a couple of words about the Denver Afterschool Alliance. It's a collaborative of stakeholders, including the city and county of Denver, Denver Public Schools, many of Denver's community based funding groups, as well as afterschool providers.And the work we're doing is focused around a vision that every child in Denver who needs afterschool programs has access to them so that we create a city where kids are safe, they're inspired to learn, they're prepared for success now and in the future.What we do in the Denver After School Alliance is we serve as an intermediary. What that means is we're a group that provides insight and technical assistance, and we are driving improvements across the after school space that are focused around data driven decision making, quality improvements, and the use of tools that allow us to chart access tohigh quality programs across the city and improve outcomes for kids. So that's really what our work is about. Don't to just say it's an honor to receive the proclamation. As the co-chair of the Denver Afterschool Alliance Board before you, you have a packet of material that's about the work we're doing.You have information in there that you may share with your constituents about how to find access to afterschool programs. In the city and county of Denver, we have an online locator system that can be found conveniently on the city's website at WW dot Denver Gov Dawg Slash Denver Afterschool Alliance.So again, thank you very much for the recognition of National Light's on after school day. We're proud that Denver is one of 7500 communities across the country celebrating this. And I would like to introduce someone who has been attending the Boys and Girls Clubs here in Denver for a long time now and wants to tell you alittle bit about his experience. This is Denver Center for International Studies senior Enrique Garcia.Hello. I am Enrique Garcia. I am a senior at the Denver Center for International Studies, and I've been a member of the Boys and Girls Club for about six years now. The Boys and Girls Club is the Boys and Girls Club is a place where I go to, where I go after school and in the summer toparticipate in many programs. Without the club, I wouldn't be the person I am today. The club helped shape me. The club gave me social skills, confidence, leadership and happiness that I didn't know I had with all the opportunities that arose from becoming a member of the Boys and Girls Club.I attend the club on a regular basis 3 to 4 times a week because it gives me a chance to relax, hang out with friends, play basketball. Stay on top of all my schoolwork. And it's also a safe place to call home.The first word that comes to mind when the Boys and Girls Club is brought up is family. That's what the Boys and Girls Club means to me. It means coming together as a community, disregarding race, age, gender, and any differences that make us human.With the Boys and Girls Club, we come together as a whole to better ourselves and our community so that we are able to get something out of life. The second word that comes to mind is future. And that's also what the club means to me.It means preparing yourself for the future in the real world so you don't have to struggle throughout life, all with the helping hand to guide you there, of course. I started at the Boys and Girls Club looking for a signature from Marcus can be former Nuggets player.I did not expect to walk out with a great future ahead of me. I participated, accomplished and done so many things with the club, from sports to the team leadership program to community service to homework help to to being a role model to the younger members.I've done it, and I'm glad to say that it is only a little part of what I've done. Without the club, I. Without the club, I don't know where I would be. And probably I'll run in the streets or at home sleeping, probably doing something that I shouldn't be doing.So I have to thank the Boys and Girls Club and the director, Julio, for that, for being there, taking me in and helping me realize what I want out of life. Quality afterschool programs really do make a difference and are important for kids and teens like me.If you don't believe me, look at Smokey Robinson, Denzel Washington, or even Shaq, all alumni of the Boys and Girls Club. I would like to close this off by saying A great future starts off with the positive attitude to stay positive and productive, and you too shall have a great future ahead of you.Thank you for listening and have a good evening.Great job. Thank you both. And thank you. Councilman Lopez, for bringing that forward. We are moving on to Proclamation 917 and we will have Councilwoman Sheperd, will you please read a proclamation 917.\nReasoning:Reasoning:",

Mayor Garcia, members of council. Much of the city's police patrol fleet has come due for replacement, and there are significant changes in store as we move to a new model of police vehicle. The current fleet is aging and this is causing a rise in maintenance and operational costs as well as increasing downtime.The city's patrol vehicle of choice for years was the Ford Crown Victoria, a model also used by the majority of police fleets across the country. However, after 30 years of production, Ford discontinued the car in 2011. At that time, the city purchased 130 new 2011 models, stockpiling them until a clear replacement could be identified.We are just now placing.The last of those 2011 models into service.It was a fortuitous decision to stockpile cars in 2011, as the market has seen new models from Ford, Chrysler and General Motors. The model that's emerged as the market leader is also the choice of the Long Beach Police Department and the Fleet Services Bureau, and that is the Ford Interceptor Utility.This vehicle is built on the Ford Explorer platform, but significantly upgraded for police, patrol duty, engine suspension, interior ergonomics.

Madam Secretary, for a comment by Council Woman Ortega. Go ahead, Councilman.Thank you, Mr. President. These bills came to committee last week or the week before, and I just want to share my concern about the fact that several of these are for the mezzanine on Concourse B, which previously were done as sort of a master concession.And although there are still two years left on that contract, this particular concessionaire was allowed to select the folks that are coming in, which will have a ten year lease, and the inconsistency of which ones get to get a seven year lease versus which ones get to get a ten year lease is consistently inconsistent and extremely frustratingfor me, and I'm sure it is for those concessionaires who aren't always treated equal, you know, so when you have restaurants that some get seven years and some get ten years, that where's that fairness and equity. So I'm not calling these out for a vote tonight.I abstained from the vote in committee because I was waiting for more information. But we've got one concessionaire that has 16 locations. The airport has a 25% cap on concentration of ownership. And I don't know how this particular concessionaire has not met that concentration of ownership.I know that not each one is 100% owned by that concessionaire, but the concern that I have is around our practices that consistently change. We flex the rules. It used to be a 20% concentration of ownership. We changed it because we had a concessionaire that de wanted to keep there.And so that bumped up to 25%, which is what that cap is now. And so I think we need to ensure that we have consistency in the application of the rules so that they don't deviate from one to another depending on who we want in and who we want out of these concession spaces.And that in itself ensures that we don't get sued as a city as we have seen happen in the past. And so I'm just expressing that frustration with the process and, you know, I'm going to let them go forward.But I just think that as an airport, it's something that we need to monitor more carefully and ensure that we've got consistency in how all the rules are being applied to everyone equally. Thank you.Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. This came up in mayor council and we had a chance to have the legal definition and protection of how this happened. And so I feel good with this legally, but I do share your concern around the consistency.And this was a different a different type of negotiation. Negotiation. So I will be supporting this as well.

Our next speaker is Tiffany on Davy.Good evening. If you see my be. I just want to just briefly go over just a few numbers. When I'm thinking about affordable, I think about, you know, being a lifelong Californian, the energy and ability of that for a majority of the population, as well as those who seek services that make, you know, a living wage forsome of those. I'll just highlight to recently online within the past year and a half buildings. One building in particular. Two bedrooms are renting for $15,945 a month. One year, that's $181,240. That ran over five years. 956,000. But it has a ripple effect throughout the city, changes the rest of the environment of when we're talking about rentalsand what others see and believe the market to be, as well as the reaction when we're going through tragedy and. And again, it is a disaster that affected every resident within the city, whether they were businessmen or not, worker or not, those living on fixed incomes or those again.Being paid non-verbally wages. Another building that just went up recently. I believe that rent. Oh, let's see. As about 13,000. This is the three bedroom, $13,360 per month. That's one year, 160,325 years, $801,000. So when we're looking at development and these density bonuses, we do understand the structure historically.But where they are coming from and really the challenges for legislatures across the nation, if not those also adopting the rate development scheme, you know, are volatile. Thank you for the work that you all do. I know this isn't really something that any one of you created.However, we all do have a part in the solution. Thank you so much.Thank you.

There is not. So any member of the public that wishes to address Council on item 12. Is there. They don't see us.We certainly can have one. Deputy Chief Robert Luna can address it.Well, I have some council members that would like to address the issue, and perhaps there are questions for Deputy Chief. Councilmember Price.Thank you, Deputy Chief Luna. How many other local city jails are offering this service? I guess two inmates. It's kind of like a Skype. Is that what it is?We've provided the video services to vice mayor and members of the City Council. We've provided the video service for the last ten years, and I don't know exactly how many other cities offer this. We can definitely research.That for you and get back to you on that.And since I'm not familiar with what happens at our local jail, is this something that is a remote access or does the visitor have to be in the jail facility to have the contact via video?The current system that we have, you have to be in the facility to facilitate this. The new system that we're going to, which we're pretty excited about, you can remotely do this from other locations. That's one of the benefits that we get from the new system, other than I mean, there's different things that we're getting with thisnew system. Like I said, we're excited about our number one. The current system only offers two languages, and the new system will offer actually 20 languages, including Combi.So does this impact at all the inmates access to the telephone? Because I know that in some city jails, most facilities, they have limited access to being able to communicate with loved ones, which is part of the punishment.So how does this affect that?The current I'm sorry, the new system that we're going to will give more access to the prisoners because the you'll be able to get it in from different locations.I notice that it says in the in the staff report that 72% of all the revenue generated is going to go to the prisoner welfare fund account. What is that account?Are you talking specifically the prisoner welfare fund? What does that go to? Yes, that's used to purchase items or make repairs that benefits the inmates while they're in custody.And there's no it says there's no fiscal impact on the city's budget. How is that? Why is that?We currently do not.Pay for.The current system. As a matter of fact. The current system, as it sits now, ranges between zero and 42% of the funding that goes to the welfare fund. And that's exactly how the vendor draws the money for it.With the new system we're going to, 72%.Of that will.Will come to the prisoner welfare fund.And this is a service we provide so that we're user friendly for the inmates. I mean, what was the.What was the.Intent behind this to make it more accessible for them to talk to their loved ones?Ah, yes, absolutely.I have no further questions.So Councilmember Price raises a couple of questions for me. And I'm wondering in this might be helpful. There's no there's not very much background or explanation in the staff reports. So at this juncture, I'm curious, why is this service being considered?Not that it's not valuable or necessary just to understand why are we considering this right now or how did it come about?Okay. Well, the the new the current system, the new vendor provides similar services to the current vendor. So the basic operation will remain the same. But going to the new vendor, number one, the current vendor offers two languages.The new vendor offers 20 languages. We also the there will be an increased commission rate that will be paid to the prisoner welfare fund. Currently, the current vendor ranges between zero and 42%, depending on the service. The new vendor, 72%, will go to the prisoner welfare fund.Web based teleconferencing also is added. As stated earlier, the person doesn't have to come to the public safety building to talk to speak to their loved one. And the.Last is the.Ten new video stations, 36 new mounted jail cell phones, three which are free to inmates for their free calls, three phones mounted on wheels to allow inmates in isolation to make phone calls. So it does increase the accessibility to the inmates to use the the video teleconferencing.Thank you, Deputy Chief Councilmember Gonzalez.Thank you. I just had a couple of questions. So who who actually will be monitoring this site? I mean.Now, when a prisoner uses this system, there is no expectation of privacy. So the person in custody and the person out of custody who's talking to the to the prisoner understands that there's no level of privacy. The video is recorded for a limited time, 90 days, and our detectives have.Access to it, if so needed.Okay. Thank you.Councilmember Mongo.Deputy Chief Luna. Sorry about my voice. Deputy Chief Luna. Would you say that this system actually increases the security and access for our prisoners so that there's less necessity to have the one on one face to face contact and all of the risks that come with bringing people in and out of the jails to talk with theirloved ones.Yes, it does. And one of the reasons we've had this system for the last ten years is we were trying to prevent any contraband from entering the custody facility. And by doing this, it prevents any either weapons and or narcotics from entering.The Long Beach jail.Thank you.Councilmember Price.I guess the question I have and you've been doing it for ten years and apparently it's working, but is there any sort of limitation on the number of calls or access that a prisoner can have because that's inmate.That's actually considered a privilege. And so does the severity of the crime impact, how frequently they can, you know, videoconference with their loved one. Does everyone now get as much access as they want? Are there any limitations to their access to the outside world?Do we now? If we don't, that's okay. I'm just curious because I know that a lot of times you get court ordered phone calls or you get a certain number of phone calls a day. And so for increasing their access, you know, my question would be, you know, why are we doing that?Is that because we're trying to be more inmate friendly as a city?Yeah. I'm going to have our jail administrator come down and answer that specific question for you.It's inmates.Says Rollie Siebert, our jail administrator.Now. And this is for anyone that's serving time at the jail arrestees, as well as people who are sentenced under AB 109, correct?Yes.Right. So convicted folks, as well as people who are pending trial on open matters.We don't have.Convicted folks.In our jail. It's pre-sentencing or pre arraignment pre-sentencing.Yes.So that means they're convicted, they're awaiting sentencing.Go ahead and answer that.They're pretrial and the video conferencing is limited by our visiting hours. So the inmates will be allowed. Actually, the people from the outside will be allowed to set up the visits through the Internet to visit the inmates. The phone system is going to be virtually the same, except the city will get a higher percentage of the ofthe revenues in the prisoner welfare fund. The rates are going to remain exactly the same. And so it's no it's no real change other than video visitation for the parents, grandparents, etc.. They can't make it to the jail.And we only keep the people for up to 4 to 6 days, depending on when they're arrested.Okay. So that the amount of stay that they would have access to this is 4 to 6 days. Yes. Okay. Thank you.Councilmember Richardson.I think if the I think where the debate just ended. So I think we're good here.Councilmember Austin.Yeah, I agree. I just was wanting some clarification on terminology versus inmates versus arrestees and what that meant. And I think that was clarified. I'm ready to vote. Thank you.Thank you. Seeing no further discussion of the. I'm sorry, members, please cast your votes.

The Committee on Government Operations, to which is referred on May 19th, 2021. Docket number 0685. In order regarding a text amendment to the Boston Zoning Code with respect to parking minimums for affordable housing submits, a report recommending.The order ought to pass in a new direction.Thank you, Madam Clerk. I now would like to record. Recognize. Councilor Edwards, the chair of the Committee on Government Ops.Councilor Edwards, you have the floor. Thank you very much. Again, this is a stock. It is about making sure that we are building appropriately and avoiding frivolous lawsuits as we're trying to house some of our most vulnerable populations.This is not about getting rid of parking. This is about making sure that if we are going to be increasing the affordability in this case, up to 60% of the units having to be at 100% or less that there should be an exchange not just with developers, but also with the neighborhoods.We don't want people to be subjugated or to be prevented from being housed because one person doesn't want those kinds of people in their neighborhood. That's what prompted our colleagues today to push this forward. We believe in affordable housing.We believe in building, and we don't think that we should have. This parking requirement currently is written as an excuse for those who don't want those kinds of people in their neighborhoods. This is a very well crafted ordinance that essentially would only apply to 46 projects in the last two and a half years, and only nine ofthem actually even needed a variance for parking. Again, the appropriate amount of parking can be built with this ordinance. It is just simply removing it as an opportunity for someone to sue to block a building from being built.I'm excited to support this. And I can tell you, I was one of the first early skeptics about it because parking is a huge issue, especially in East Boston. Majority of these projects that are 60% or more aren't being built right now in Boston.So it wouldn't actually impact a lot of folks in the neighborhoods I represent. But it is as much as there's that wonderful project that comes along that's 100% affordable that is going to house our seniors, house our families and make it a place, a neighborhood, be vibrant and thrive even further.I want to make sure I remove any excuse from those who don't want those people in their neighborhood, including suing over the fact that there isn't enough parking. And that's what this is doing. I want to congratulate the sponsors for this ordinance.I want to thank Councilor Bob, Councilor O'Malley. And I believe this councilor now Councilor Boston Councilor O'Malley, for your leadership. And I will now turn it over to those sponsors. But I do recommend that we move forward, that we build forward for families and we make sure that parking isn't the only thing we're focused on, but housingpeople. Thank you.Thank you. Councilor Edwards, the chair now recognizes.The lead sponsor, Councilor Bar Council. But you have the floor. Thank you so much, Madam Chair. Thank you so much to Councilor Edwards for her work leading us through the government operations process with this and to my colleague, President O'Malley on it, as well as Councilor Edwards said, this is it's a targeted measure and it's really meantto prevent us from losing and delaying critically needed affordable housing for seniors, supportive housing, etc., on the basis of of these parking minimums in the zoning code. And we have seen a number of lawsuits that have gone that are based on the variances being granted for these projects.And parking is is one of the key components of that. Often I have to say that I was very moved. We there was a protest in Councilor O'Malley's district on September 18th, and we heard from a lot of the folks at Mass Senior Action there.And the number of them came to the hearing and also testified this month. And, you know, when you really put a face to the unit that you're not getting, when we talk about those 38 units at the JP project and you really realize that this is an it's not a theoretical debate.And and I think that, you know, this we we still have to send to the zoning commission. But I think that it would it would reflect a really important update to help us get more of those units through.And I think this is a body that agrees that we need more units like that all over the city as fast as possible. So I, uh, I'm very grateful to the chair for her recommendation today, and I would urge colleagues to join me and President O'Malley in supporting this measure.Thank you so much, Madam Chair.Thank you very much, Councilor Bach. The chair now recognizes the co-sponsor.Councilor O'Malley. Councilor O'Malley, you now have a. Oh, stop.We.Can I have the floor?Thank you very much, Madam Chair. And thank you, of course, to the chair of the Government Operations Committee, Councilor Edwards, and my dear colleague and co-sponsor Councilor. Very simply, there's a old expression many of us know for me once.Shame on you. Fool me twice. Shame on me. I'm not going to let us be fool twice on this. And we actually had two very concrete examples of this weaponization of parking minimums to prevent needed affordable housing in my district, directly across the street from one another, Pine Street, and had a project that was for formerly unhousedindividuals. Right across the street, the JPM, DC, one of the premier neighbor development corporations had a heated senior affordable housing. All want both 100% affordable. They went through a robust community process. And I want to be clear, because I think some skeptics may say, well, the community process is sacrosanct.Of course it is. And as a district councilor, I know that better than most, and you know that better than most. Both of these projects had a robust community process where the community came together, hammered out issues around parking, around gentrification, around affordability, around height, around shadows, around environmental ism.You run the gamut. And both projects were almost 100% supported by every neighborhood group, every civic association. That's no small feat in Jamaica Plain, particularly, ladies and gentlemen, both of these were as positive and as supported a projects that I've seen, and both have been held up by the same individual under the guise of parking.And what we're seeking to do here is to have a simple but impactful change to the zoning code that will no longer allow parking minimum minimums to derail otherwise incredibly supported projects. This this text amendment does not change the fact that we do need parking people have cars.This does not change the fact that anything can be built without any community process or any opportunity for folks to weigh in. But what it simply does is it allows a fix of a real problem which is holding up affordable housing units right now.Thank you to the co-sponsor for her great work today, the chair of the committee for her leadership and again to the individuals who came and who testified and who offered their perspective. That was the most compelling reason why we should vote for this.So thank you for allowing me to speak on this and look forward to urge you all to please vote on the affirmative present. Thank you, Madam Chair.Thank you, Councilor O'Malley. The chair now recognizes the District five Councilor Councilor Arroyo.Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you to the sponsors for this ordinance. We in District five had a project. It predates my tenure by just a little bit that was a 100% affordable that was actually killed due to parking concerns prior to getting approval.And we know as district councilors that parking can often be a five letter word depending on who you're speaking to. But we also know in this city we are facing record levels of displacement, the cost of survival and living, and is making it from today to tomorrow in the city rises every day.The cost of living in the city and buying homes or property has drastically increased. If you look at what it cost my parents to move into Hyde Park in 1981 to what it would cost and has cost my siblings to try and continue to live in Hyde Park today.It's it's night and day. And so I see this as dealing with climate change being the other imminent crisis, the crisis of the day, which is affordable housing in the city of Boston. And anything we can do and I and I strictly mean this, I see it as our obligation to do anything we can do to lessenthe burden on developers and on communities to welcome and to have affordable housing in their neighborhoods. I will always argue that having that housing for an individual and we heard moving and gripping testimony during the hearing for this makes a world of difference.And if the tradeoff is a parking space so that somebody can leave a shelter, somebody can have a place to call home, somebody can lay down roots in our neighborhoods and be valuable members to us. I would take that a million times to one, and so I hope that this passes.I hope that we as a body put our strength behind this unanimously. But I am thankful that this hit the ground. And I welcome more more ordinances like this that make it easier for affordable housing to be built into existing city.Boston.

The Code Chapter eight 120 as it relates to the temporary enforcement of the health orders regarding COVID 19.The amendments concerning length of time understanding the monster ordinance were to expire tomorrow on January 20th. Allowing for enforcement beyond the most recent promulgation of the order seems consistent with ultimate goal to preserve life during this ongoing pandemic.As for the amendments to enforcement and penalties, I also support that in light of recent events wherein a business within the food and beverage sector openly defied this health order publicly and on multiple counts, in addition to organizing like minded business owners to meet, to find ways to continue to defy, to defy the health order.I find this and the aforementioned amendments to be urgent. The fact remains that the health orders are promulgated in an effort to ensure all members of the community are safe and the orders should not be subject to an individual feeling or law.That is what I said with that empathy for all affected, but for concerns of the safety and health of every member of our community.Thank you.

And thank you and your team for getting this resolution. 31933 on the agenda of your governance committee during this busy time. And I want to thank the committee for their unanimous approval of this resolution.I'd also like to thank those who took the time to contact us in support of this resolution, including Dr. Cathy Tuttle, who originated this excellent idea, Katie Wilson of the Transit Riders Union. Vlad Gutmann, the Washington State Director of Climate Solutions, Dr. Avia morris, and several other important environmental scientists and advocates.Colleagues, it's a time it's timely to approve this climate change resolution today because as we know, our nation has been enduring another historically horrible wildfire season with harmful smoke contaminating the air we breathe here in Seattle. Last month, King County updated its climate plan.And like the resolution before you today, it appropriately addresses both carbon emissions and adaptation or resiliency to climate change. King County's progress is a powerful reminder that City Hall can do more to address climate change, too. Today we have this legislative vehicle resolution 31933 to do something more specifically to update the summary and fiscal note, to vieweach piece of city legislation through a climate lens. How will it impact climate change, specifically emissions and resiliency? Just asking these two questions on emissions and adaptation is an important step forward and will provide council members with a more comprehensive view when making legislative decisions.It's important to note that the resolution will require the executive to report back to council in March about the initial results of the implementation, including any ideas for making it better. Council president. May I move for passage of resolution 31933?That is not necessary, but we will just call the roll on it in a moment since it's a resolution. But at this point, I'm going to go ahead and invite other colleagues to provide comments on the resolution. As is tradition and required by the rules.You'll have the last word and we'll close debate out to the extent that there is any. Are there any additional comments, cosmos data, please. And then Casper Morales. Thank you very much. Council President. I also want to thank Councilmember Peterson.Thank you for your work with our office to include some of the modifications and to this resolution. We really appreciate that the substitute added language under climate impacts and climate resiliency sections that calls out potential intersections of carbon emissions, impact and race and social justice impacts.We know that climate change disproportionately impacts black, indigenous and people of color, communities and low income workers. And this language really helps focus that analysis to make sure we're considering climate justice, not just climate change. We are also appreciative of that added prompt to describe the potential impacts on emissions and climate resiliency, not just the not justthe the fact that we're implementing policy or projects because it's important that our climate analysis look at the bigger picture to understand the tradeoffs around action or inaction, as we just discussed at community, I mean, as we discussed at the committee meetings, I think that that's a really important and thank you for all of your work onthis. And I think this this effort helps us move in a more strategic way towards a dynamic fiscal note as we're constantly trying to improve the process for fiscal notes to look at the tradeoffs between action or inaction, the cost of doing something or the costs of not doing something.This is an important element to that discussion. So thank you very much. Any concern was getting concerned. Morales.Thank you. I want to thank Councilmember Peterson for bringing this. I think we are asking the right questions with this addition to the fiscal note about the resulting carbon emissions and about our climate resiliency. Not being a member of that committee, I am I am curious if there is any information, specific information you could provide about thekind of analysis that will be done and who will be doing it if this information will be coming directly to central staff to report out to us on our summaries, or if it will be central staff doing this, I'd just like a little bit more information, if that's something you can provide.Yes.I got Handsomer Pierson.Thank you. Thank you for the question, Councilmember Morales. So the legislation, since so much of the legislation will come actually through from the executive. We did we did vetted and talked carefully with the Office of Sustainability and Environment, as well as the City Budget Office.I also talked to Dan Eat of central staff about it because obviously central staff will also be working on legislation that we originate. And this is a qualitative response to the diversion of the fiscal note in front of us today.It's one of the attachments on the agenda. It asks the big picture questions about emissions and adaptation, and then it provides some suggestions on how that information could be provided. So O.C. is likely to work with other city departments to sort of train the trainers and in so that the whole city government is really thinking about this. And instead of just having, you know, a couple of experts in a key department like O.C., the idea is to have this permeate through our entire city government. It's doing things through the lens of climate change.There are no other questions or comments on this resolution. Councilmember. Please.Thank you. Just for clarification sake. Councilmember Peterson, you referenced that there would be a report back from the Budget Office and the Office of Sustainability and the Environment in March. But do I understand correctly that this new requirement does not wait to go into effect until that March report?In fact, it goes into effect. And then they're reporting back to us on what worked and what didn't work, but sort of through a practice of of preparing that these additional notes on climate and resiliency.Correct. And we work those dates out with with them as well to make sure that it will start January 1st. But then they'll report back to us in three months after that.Thank you.Any other comments on the resolution? Hey, hearing man, Kazmir Peterson.

Do you and each of you solemnly state that the testimony you may give in the cause now and pending before this body shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.Thank you. I'm going to begin the hearing with the staff report.I'd like to introduce Patricia Defender for our planning manager who will make this a staff presentation. Thank you so much. Good evening, mayor. Vice Mayor, council members. This item before you is an appeal by the applicant of specific conditions of approval imposed on a conditional use permit for the sale of alcohol at a grocery outlet grocery store. Council is being requested to uphold the Planning Commission decision on this matter on September 16th of this year. The Planning Commission conditionally approved a conditional use permit to allow the off site sale of beer, wine and distilled spirits in conjunction with a 6000 square foot expansion of an existing approximately 14,000 square foot grocery store.The grocery store in question is located at 13/47 Street on the south side of Seventh Street between Almond and Nebraska Avenues in the central area of the city. The grocery store is a tenant in the existing shopping center and will comprise that will comprise just over 20,000 square feet with the expansion.The project site is predominately surrounded by residential uses, but properties in the vicinity have a variety of zoning designations, including commercial mixed use and residential zoning, as shown on the map. On this slide, the grocery store currently has a conditional use permit to allow the offsite sale of beer and wine, which was approved by the Planning Commissionin 2008. The subject conditional use permit is required because of the expansion of the liquor license to include the offsite sale of distilled spirits and also due to the expanded footprint of the grocery store and those operations. The Planning Commission based its approval on the fact that positive findings could be made in support of the request, particularlyas it relates to limitations related to overconcentration of alcohol sales and allowing alcohol sales in high crime areas. You can see here the Planning Commission did find that the approval would not contribute to an overconcentration of alcohol licenses in the area at this location, as this location already has an alcohol license and that the site is notlocated in a high crime area and thus determined that the required conditions are met and positive findings could be found. The subject of appeal was filed by the applicant, who has concerns specifically related to two conditions conditions number 14 and 20.The applicant requests that condition number 20, requiring an onsite security guard between the hours of 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. daily be eliminated and additionally request a modification to condition number 14 to allow the sale of beer or malt beverages and 22 ounce containers, which is a common container size.This approval already does allow the sale of craft beers in that container size. As previously stated, council is requested to uphold the Planning Commission decision. However, if council wishes to consider alternatives, there are some alternative modification or modifications to the conditions that could be considered.The condition number 20 and option of the Council is to update the condition to allow the applicant to be relieved of the requirement after a 12 month period with a zoning administrator review for condition number 14, that condition could be modified to grant an exception in container size for microbrews and specialty malts, so sold under certain designationsthat are listed here on the slide and. And that concludes the staff presentation. The appellant is here and will speak more to the appeal points and I am available to answer any questions you might have.Do we have the we have comments now from the appellant.I don't know where members of the council.Before we before we begin, I just want to make sure. But reasonable time is 5 minutes enough for you? Yeah.Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much for that. Good evening. My name is Steve Rawlings. I'm a business consultant to grocery outlet. Joining me this evening is Pat Barber, who is the vice president of real estate for grocery outlets, as well as Dave O'Connell, who is the property manager for the shopping center that this site is locatedin. First of all, we greatly appreciate the Planning Commission for approving us to move forward with a 6000 square foot expansion, as well as be able to add some distilled spirits. The only reason we're here is we were just hoping for some consideration on a little bit of modification on the particular conditions of approval.One was as as Patricia, so well articulated. Just just don't allow us to be able to sell craft beer in in kind of the 22 and 24 ounce containers. And what was presented to you as draft modification language is is acceptable to us, and that would allow us to accomplish what we're trying to do there.The second was was the security guard. There was a time that was placed between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., which we didn't we didn't quite understand where that was coming from. But that was ultimately the condition that was adopted.Subsequent to that, we hear Patterson, who is the store operator, a Long Beach resident. We met with her as well as Lieutenant Gonzales out at the site. And Barbara, myself, to kind of talk about, you know, security issues and what we could do to, you know, make sure that we're helping out with the situation.He informed everybody that she already employs a person whose sole job is, you know, security and or loss prevention from the hours of 4 p.m. to closing Monday, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. She's been on the property now for about four years.She's the hardest working person you'll ever meet. She's at that store 60, 70 hours each and every week. She understands what it takes to run a clean and safe operation. And she is determined that that those are the best hours.So, you know, our request was, you know, hey, if we could be relieved of that condition because we're already proactively trying to take care of any issues out there, and we haven't been a great source of issues with our operations.But alternatively, if the Council would like to see a specific condition in there, we would just ask that it be aligned a little bit more with what we're already doing, because I think that that has proven to be effective and that, you know, that security plan be open for review either by the zoning administrator.I think I proposed the Long Beach Police Department and it doesn't make a difference to us either way. So in essence, that is the request. Grocery outlet already operates three stores in Long Beach. They did sign a lease for a to open another store on Long Beach Boulevard and Willow.So we're hoping to get that open relatively soon. They have been embraced by the neighborhoods that they they serve. They're very happy that they've been making investments in your community and are looking forward to possibly continuing to make more investments there.So thank you for your time and consideration. I think Pat just had one or two other quick comments. Yeah. Thank you.We still have about a minute and a half. So for.Little.Share here, Pat.Good evening. My name is Pat Barber. I'm vice president of real estate for Grocery Outlet. I've been working on supermarket real estate for 43 years. I've seen thousands of shopping centers and grocery stores. It is exceedingly rare. In my observance, it is true for a city to require that a security person be stationed at certain hours ina store. This existing store, which has been operated by IKEA for four years plus without getting into details about how a grocery outlet does business has not had a problem. She's there all the time. She sees what the issues are.She deals with them. We have had no complaints filed by any of the people that received the notice of this meeting. I just say we really don't think that it's at all necessary for you to make a specific requirement with regard to a security person for the store, given that the operator of this store herself, who's blackand who's a woman and who's very involved in the community and has received awards within the community for her involvement with the community should be overruled by you folks. You know a lot of things, but she knows a lot about operating this store.I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have. With regards to grocery outlet, it's a public company. 75 years old, 414 stores growing are going to be doing another new store shortly in the city. We love this store.It's growing nicely. We need the extra space. We're not including any additional space for the sale of alcoholic beverages. Thank you.Very much. And I believe that concludes the the appellant's time. I believe there is a additional appellant and then the staff. Any additional comment or response?No additional comments.Thank you. Is it public? Is there any public comment know for this?There is no public comment for this item.You think? Yeah, I think you have them queued up for public comment prior to the hearing start.Not prior to the start of the item.Okay.Mr. Graham, please. Please grab a seat. Thank you. Just just to be clear. Madam Clerk, how does public comment work for hearings? And are items.You need to come in and get a speaker card prior to the beginning of the item being read once the item is read. We closed the speakers list. So please, if you'd like to speak on an item, you can come over and get a speaker card prior to the item being read.And I believe that's how it's been been done. That is correct. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have to follow the rules that are in place for the hearing, for and for the council. So there's a motion and there's no public comment about Councilman Allen.So I might. My job is to follow the rules established by the City Council on hearings. So unless I get direction differently from the city attorney because it's a legal procedure, I have to follow exactly the rules that are set by the body and the council.So unless I'm told differently by the attorney, that's the rules I have to follow. So let me. Sir. Sir, I need to.Councilman Allen. All right. First of all, I want to say thank you to city staff director R.C. and Development Services. Detective Gonzalez, Avon Police Department, for your frequent communication with my office. I also enjoyed seeing Payton, Steve and the folks here from a grocery outlet.I feel that with regards to city staff that you engage both the community and the applicant to work and find solutions for for all the parties. And I know that it can be really hard some time sometimes to balance all the issues on on different sites.That being said, the Planning Commission unanimously voted on these conditions, and I have carefully reviewed the circumstances and staff's updated recommendations. So the two items of the appeal are separate. I do support the modification to condition 14, allowing the sale of a 22 ounce to 24 ounce beer and malt beverages.I think these are common sizes these days for local and small breweries and they reduce the bottling cost. Now, with regard to Condition 20, the security guard condition, if we were able to update the condition to allow the applicant to be relieved of the requirement for the onsite security guard by allowing the zoning administrator action after a12 month period of good operations can only shorten the minimal period of good operations before possibly relieving the operator of this security guard requirement.Yes, we can reduce.That to six months. That's the pleasure of the council.Okay. I also I received the supplemental letter sent in by grocery outlet regarding that condition, and I've seen the public comments that were also submitted to the Planning Commission as well. And I believe the city staff has created a good balance.So I like to make the like to move the following. I like to approve the amendment to condition 14 as outlined by the staff, and also update condition 20 to allow the applicant to be relieved of the requirement for the onsite security guard, by the way, of zoning administrator action after a six month period of good operations. Thank you is the second by Councilman Desmond Austin. Any comments? Any comments by the city council? Any additional comment, Mr. City Attorney. Okay, there's a motion and a second. Please go to cast your votes. Sir. We need to go.Please. Let's not be disruptive to the hearing.Motion is carried.Mix item is for transfers items 33 and you business 52 to 58.\nReasoning:Reasoning:",
        "answer": "The meeting transcript is about a first hearing on an appeal by the applicant of specific conditions of approval imposed on a conditional use permit for the sale of alcohol at a grocery outlet grocery store. The Planning Commission had conditionally approved a conditional use permit to allow the off-site sale of beer, wine, and distilled spirits in conjunction with a 6000 square foot expansion of an existing approximately 14,000 square foot grocery store. The appellant requested that condition number 20, requiring an onsite security guard between the hours of 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. daily, be eliminated and condition number 14 be modified to allow the sale of beer or malt beverages in 22-ounce containers. The council was requested to uphold the Planning Commission's decision on this matter, but alternative modifications to the conditions were also presented. The council approved the amendment to condition 14 and updated condition 20 to allow the applicant to be relieved of the requirement for the onsite security guard by the way of zoning administrator action after a six-month period of good operations.Therefore, the summary of the meeting transcripts is:\nRecommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record, conclude the public hearing, and consider the appeal from the applicant, Steve Rawlings representing Grocery Outlet (APL21-007); and\r\n\r\nUphold the Planning Commission’s decision to approve a Conditional Use Permit (CUP21-004) with conditions of approval, to allow the off-site sale of beer, wine and distilled spirits (Type 21 License) in conjunction with a 6,000-square-foot expansion of the existing grocery store located at 1340 East 7th Street in the Community Auto-Oriented Commercial (CCA) Zoning District.

My hope and I know Councilwoman Kenney has been working on this. Councilwoman Gilmore, I believe, has him coming to committee on Wednesday to talk about their local or targeted hire program.But it is really important that we get to a place where we actually have goals set because we have nothing to measure against otherwise. And when you have goals, then you set a very clear parameter for the folks coming in and bidding on the work to know what the expectations are in terms of the percentage of peoplethat they will be hiring from throughout our city, that we want to ensure, get to take advantage of the apprenticeship jobs and the ability to take advantage of a career path job. And so I just call that out to say this is important.Some of us will continue to work in the direction of ensuring that we have goals attached to the work, not only with National Western, but as we move forward with the build out of DIA in all of our big bond projects.So thank you, Madam President.Thank you, Councilwoman.

This is some of the exciting parts of the transportation work this relates to if you're familiar with where Adobe in. Google are adjacent to the Fremont Bridge on the north side of the bridge and where the Burkman Trail Press is under the Fremont Bridge.It's a parcel underneath the bridge approach there. As I mentioned earlier, this this same work came before the council a few years back. For some variety of reasons. The council approved it at the time, but the legislation was never or what we authorized never actually was filed in the appropriate way before it expired.I believe it had to do with an attorney that was working for Fremont Company that retired, and it got buried in a piece of paper, in a stack of paper that no one else picked up. What specifically is happening is the city owns the right of way under the approach there.If you go on the Berkman, you'll see that there's actually parking down there, which is operated by Fremont Bridge Company through my company. Fremont DOT Company owns properties adjacent to that and the city requires easement to get to its property.So there was a trade that was made where Fremont, our company, would allow the city to have access to our property through their property in exchange for Fremont, our company being allowed to operate the parking underneath that. As I mentioned, this was agreed to a number of years ago, but it was never finalized.And so this will take this up once again and hopefully will get finalized appropriately.Very good.

Recommendation to execute amendments to contract with Bellingham Marine Industries and Concept Marine Associates relating to the Alamitos Bay Marina. Rebuild Project and increase appropriations in the Marina Fund in the Parks Recreation and Marine Department District three.Thank you. And I know Councilwoman Price has a presentation to make, so if I can turn it over to her.Thank you very much, Vice Mayor. I want to first acknowledge Rick Jerry, who is here, he's the chair of the Marine Advisory Committee. And I want to thank him for his service and for everything that he's done to support this process.I also want to recognize the hard work and dedication that Parks Recreation and Marine Director Steven Scott and our Marine Bureau Manager Alveda Hallinan have displayed during the rebuild of our marinas a major undertaking and one of the largest infrastructure projects that the city has embarked upon.The city of Long Beach has the largest municipality managed marina in the United States. Our marinas are in the best location in California as vessels are protected by a series of offshore breakwaters and natural bays with easy access to open water and sailing conditions that are nearly perfect year round due to prevailing winds.All three of our city's marinas were originally built in the 1950s and the 1960s, and our occupancy rate has remained steady at 98% and 2005 and 2007. The city rebuilt the downtown marinas, and in 2011, construction started on the Alamitos Bay Marina, Bellingham Marine.The company completing this major infrastructure project is the global leader in design, manufacturing and construction of marinas. Bellingham Marine enjoys an unrivaled reputation within the industry and has installed more than 20 million square feet of concrete floating docks throughout the world.Reconstruction work has included demolition of existing wooden docks, removal of piles, dredging, installation of new piles, assembly and installation of concrete docks, upgraded utilities at the docks, as well as restroom and parking lot rebuilds. The magnitude of this project has required the Marine Bureau to.Temporarily.Relocate boat owners during reconstruction. Reconstruction includes demolition of existing wooden docks, removal of piles.I think already set those.To date, we have completed basins one, four, five and eight. Basin two is planned to be completed by spring 2016, and Basin three will be completed by December of 2017, followed by Basin six and seven in December 2018.The total estimated cost to rebuild the Alamitos Bay Marina is $110 million. I want to thank John GROSS and Alveda Hannan and Hallinan for working so closely with one another when we earlier this year approved.The.The bond sales. They have done a fantastic job. And I'm so grateful for their their service and their commitment to this project. Thanks to our chief of staff, Julie Maliki, we have a short video that we'd like to show regarding the rebuilding process for Basin four, which is the basin located next to the Long Beach Yacht Club. Instead. You. And of course. This move. Your face. Really? See. Running away.Julie That was awesome. I'm wondering if that song is part of Julie Maliki's playlist. I would have gone with more of a Spanish flare song, but that was good. I liked it. Thank you very much, Julie, and the team that she assembled to put this video together.Honestly, this project is so amazing. The marinas look wonderful. Almost brought me to tears to watch that video. I'm so proud to have that in the city of Long Beach. Boat owners all around the region thank us and are so appreciative for this process.We are way ahead of so many other marinas and still offering these these spaces at a very reasonable cost to to the user. So I am so grateful for that. I'm not sure if there's a staff report. I just kind of took over.But I.Can't remember. I think you covered it very well and we're available to answer questions if needed.Thank you guys very much. This is such a pride for the city of Long Beach. I'm so grateful for your leadership. And Elvira's very balanced. Mechanisms that she uses to make sure that boat owners are treated consistently and fairly.I'm so grateful for that. I think that's a very important attribute to bring to the position. So thank you, Alveda.Thank you. There's been a motion and a second. Is there any member of the public? Well, Councilwoman Price, I'm sorry.I forgot to mention one thing. I would be remiss not to mention that my colleague, council member, Iran is on the Coastal Commission and I thank him for all the approvals that made this project possible because without their support, we would not be able to do these great things with our properties along the coast.So thank you.You can speak on this item.Yes, I was going to.Okay.Thank you. Diana Le Jean. I think it's just really brief. I've seen a figure here of $96 million.Almost.Close to $100 million. Is that what it is? I'm. I'm just sorry. I'm just having such a hard time with that. That amount of money. It's beautiful. I mean, there's no question about it, but I'm having a really hard time understanding $100 million.And yet here we're we I mean, on some boats and a luxury item when people who are sick and and we're we're arguing about you know it will be coming up but I'm just amazed at the amount of money being spent here when we're we're worried about a fairly small amount of money facilitating people who are really, really sick. So I just.Had to say that. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please.Hi. My name's Stephanie Dawson. So I'm a resident of Second District. I'm just struck by the kind of contrast that was created today. We had the chief of the Housing Department talking about a 120 day wait list for applicants, which I will add there is a they have not accepted more people on the waitlist since 2007.As a result of this, we're now subsidizing essentially the cheapest rent in the city of Long Beach by providing $100 million to dredge this and reformat this marina for boat slips that costs $500 a month. So in the era of a fort, when we're in desperate need for affordable housing, when people are losing their homes because they'rebeing priced out of the city of Long Beach. $100 million would go really, really far to developing places where people can actually live.Councilman Price. Thank you. If I could just have staff educate the folks regarding where the money for the marina rebuild came from. I think there's some confusion, miscommunication there.Thank you. Councilmember Vice Mayor. Yes, we'd absolutely like to do that. This is a completely restricted fund. This is the Marina Sub Fund of the Tidelands. This is money collected by boat owners and can only be used for boat owner purposes.It could not be used for any of the other purposes that we would use in the city. So none, no general fund funds were used, no tidelands dollars with the exception of marina funds in the sub funding of the Tidelands Fund.Thank you. I appreciate that.

Please cast your votes. Motion carries gray in the next one. And we have three items that were related to this.So we're going to do 22, 24 and 25. When I read. That's one. I'm sorry. 22, 23, 25.Item 22. Communication from Vice Mayor Richardson. Councilwoman Gonzales. Councilwoman Mongo. Councilman Andrew's recommendation to direct the Economic Development Department to work with Los Angeles Local Initiatives Support Corporation and a Long Beach Community Foundation to establish Long Beach as Akiva City Vice Mayor.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Just have a couple a couple of points here to make. So blueprint. Objective number two on economic inclusion specifically calls out increasing nontraditional capital resources for minorities and women owned businesses. Kiva is a nonprofit, innovative, online microfinance platform that works to expand access to financial services for small business owners who have the dreamand potential but are locked out of commercial traditional commercial loans. Using the Kiva platform, borrowers can apply for crowdfunded loans of up to $10,000 with a 0% interest rate. Kiva Borrowers are typically entrepreneurs who cannot qualify for conventional business financing due to poor credit time in business or little financial collateral.Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Long Beach is home to diverse communities and economies, with more than 9800 small businesses employing nearly 100,000 people. Yet one of the biggest challenges facing these small business owners, especially women and minority owned businesses, is the inability to access capital.That's why Long Beach becoming a key city is vital to the success of our vital of our vibrant small business community. To date, there are only 16 cities across the U.S. with Kiva City designation, and since 2005, Kiva has crowdfunded more than 2.4 million loans totaling over $1,000,000,000, with a global repayment rate of 97%.The Kiva platform has attracted the community, a community of over 1.6 million Lennar lenders from 180 different countries. So the proposal tonight is to help get Kiva off the ground in Long Beach and to support a part time point person.This person will provide support to city staff regarding the Kiva platform. Ten Key Kiva trainings as needed. Market and promote the program. Recruit and train Kiva borrowers to use Kiva Lending Program. Help set up other Kiva trustee partners within the city.Provide annual or semiannual training to Cuba. Trustee Partners and the City of Long Beach. Provide one on one support to help organizations identify and bring forth strong Kiva borrowers. Fundraise for a match that meets previous terms, which has no interest, no fees, and no credit score.One of our partners on Kiva is the Los Angeles Local Initiative Support Corporation, who will bring technical advice, technical assistance to the city to train staff and borrowers to use the Kiva application. So I want to thank. Executive director to new address input for helping to.For volunteering to offer this support. They'll also help us to market and promote the program, recruit borrowers and use their $100,000 accelerator fund to help borrowers reach their goals quicker. In addition, I want to thank the Long Beach Community Foundation, who've already pledged to help support the first year costs.Your support is invaluable to the success of this program, and I want to thank co-sponsors Councilwoman Gonzalez, Councilwoman Mongeau and Councilmember Andrews for dedicating one time funds to help bring Keep It Along Beach as well. But it's not too late.If council members have ideas or suggestions, you're more than welcome to put in some funds on these startup costs too. So I couldn't. So that's totally with a couldn't ask before do the Brown act. But we can totally ask now.So anybody who wants to get in on Kiva, now's the time. I'm pretty sure every district it once was off the ground. We're going to want every one of our businesses to participate. So. So you're more than welcome to help us get off the ground.Thank you. And that's my motion. Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzales.I just want to say thanks again, Vice Mayor. I think when I first heard about Kiva was in and about in Kenya. Actually, I wasn't in Kenya, but I heard about it as an initiative that was taking place in Kenya for entrepreneurs there in a third world country.And I thought, it's interesting, we're going to bring it here. But now that I looked at this, this is absolutely fantastic, especially in the whole realm of economic inclusion. And I will say as well, just to reiterate the points I've said before with women and just making sure that women are at the table, making sure that womenare presenting. So I'm glad to see that, to know it will be a part of that. I know she's a very strong woman. That will absolutely be a great part of this program and making sure that we are, of course, providing opportunities for borrowers to sorry for lenders to understand what the risks are.And really, I'm actually looking at the Kiva website and it shows that the repayment rate is, I think, averaging over 95%. Yeah, 97, 95%, which is fantastic. So I think that. Is really great. This is a fantastic program.I'm glad we brought this here. And I want to thank John Keisler as well for his work in this. And Sergio, thank you.Thank you. Councilman Pearce.I want to thank you again for bringing this item. When I think about the second District and I think about how many great startups we have, coffee shops, chocolatiers was actually ended up in the first district. But a lot of these small people that start in their homes could benefit from Kiva.So RECs, I'm in, come in and look.I'll take that as a friendly amendment.That's a friendly amendment to include city to maybe to in being a part of, of this initiative. And I really look forward to having some conversations with staff and doing some outreach as well. So fantastic. Thank you.Thank you. Councilwoman Mongo.Was there disclosure of how much you just committed to? I think it's I think it's 6200 is what.We're committing.62.And so.It's less. Right.That would be true. Five, five, 5000. And so thank you for that.The five ways.Now I just want to thank council members for putting their money where their mouth is because I think that's what really demonstrates to businesses. Businesses put money and they finance refinanced their homes. Some of them who even have good credit, they they don't need a loan that's as big as banks sometimes give.And so the process and the paperwork and the work, this crowd funding of loans is just an amazing opportunity. I'm already a lender on Kiva and I hope you'll go online and join me. Get ready. Loan the Long Beach business some money soon.Thank you. Is there a public comment on this? I know we've heard saying saying none. We have a motion and a second. Please cast your votes.\nReasoning:Reasoning:",

So our next proclamation and last proclamation is the art and wine fair. This is the 35th anniversary of the Alameda Art and Wine Fair.So who's that? I see. Janet Maccabee, executive director of downtown Alameda Business Association. So come on now. Here's your proclamation. Where is the first? Alameda Art and Wine Fair was held 35 years ago on August three and four in 1984.And. Whereas, the event continues to be the largest street festival on the island, staffed by 200 volunteers each year, a total of 7000 volunteers and over 14000 hours of service over the past 35 years.

Acknowledging the 35th anniversary of the art and wine fair in historic downtown Alameda, the downtown Alameda Business Association Board of Directors, Board, committee staff and our event partner Equestrian Productions are most grateful for the years of support that this council and the many thathave gone before have given. We are equally thankful for the support of the dedicated city staff, including but not limited to our police and fire departments. Permits and planning, public works, economic development as each have assisted us with the details necessary to pull off this major event.Many of you have volunteered and your time and your talents and you've stood by local residents that have also helped our loyal sponsors and community partners that have helped to fund this undertaking. Share this honor with our association.We'd like to acknowledge our downtown businesses who roll out the welcome mat for tens of thousands of people every time we put this event on. And so we are ever grateful to them for their hospitality. I hope you can all be there on the 27th and 28th.Thank you.But difficult. I know you don't think congratulations like married.There were some issue with ABC which.Okay. Next step is oral communications where we have a limited number of speakers may address the counsel regarding any matter not on the agenda and we have 15 minutes set aside for that and any additional public comment that doesn't happen in those 15 minutes will happen later in the agenda.So do we have any speakers?We have three.Three. So with three speakers you will each get 3 minutes. You never have to feel like you have to use all 3 minutes. But any. Would you want to call our speakers?Sure. Pat Potter Mackenzie. Tap and simmer.You don't know how tempted I am to continue my conversation on the car, but I won't.I'm not on the agenda.It's not on me anyway. I just wanted to point out that that the impression I got from that incredibly great city comment meeting at the Elks Lodge about carp was so well attended and the ideas were so fantastic.But the one thing I took away was that most people hadn't read the document. They wanted to tell you what they felt about climate and and that sort of thing, but they hadn't read the document, or they may have read the executive summary.And the reason is, is because this document is so heavy. I mean, it's so big. So what I'd like to suggest is that that every time you have a plan, when it's a draft, you make five copies of it, you give it to the library.\nReasoning:Reasoning:",

But I'm going to start this off with Vice Mayor Lowenthal.Thank. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I wanted to ask the staff and the owners that are here, I believe, to indulge me on this. I know we were trying to get to some consensus with residents and we're pretty close.I think there are a couple of items that we need to still work out. And so I'd like to ask that we put this over for two weeks time certain, which I think makes it February 17th. Is that correct?I'm not sure, Mr. City Attorney, is that.Yeah. So that's my motion.I could certainly move it over.To the 17th.Yes.Okay. So the motion is to move this item to the 17th. That the motion. Okay. Is there a second on that motion?Oh, second.Okay, there's a second. Can you get. There's no motion before. Could you get a plug in. Pushed the motion please. Thank you. Any public comment on the motion before us today?Please.My name is Jeff, darling. I represent one of the owners of the Mineshaft Incorporated, one of the seven owners. Holding it over is a little bit inconvenient for us since the owners are in other cities. I came flew down from Northern California in Redding to represent them.Most of them live in several different cities. It's a family trust business. We've operated for 33 years under the current patio situation. The only difference to what we're trying to do is just add entertainment in the changing environment of the bar business.People are more responsible and don't go out right after work and and drink for 2 hours before they go home. We need a business model that can attract business with special events now and this model that we're trying to function under.And it really doesn't it just brings in a deejay. We currently have jukeboxes, so it doesn't really impact the sound level any different than it did before. It just allows us to have special event nights with a, you know, kind of like a Go-Go dancer type person.One of the performers to attract a special event night are hours, a bar hours are affected. You know, if we can't use the patio, if we shut it down at 10:00 per say, that's that's a critical time frame for a bar.That's just how bars work. Bars don't get busy until 10:00. And, you know, they close it, too. So any time we limit the hours, I think it greatly impacts us. I think one of the problems is we want to be good neighbors and being a good neighbor means that the people in close proximity are impacted.But there was an analogy at the last meeting that I watched the video and it said, you know, it's kind of like that when you move next to an airport, you can't expect the planes not to land at an airport.We've been there in operation for many, many years, and when they move there, they are impacted, unfortunately. I think what we need to do as a business is be a good steward and work with the people to add acoustic treatment.One of my proposals, I you know, we can talk about that later if we continue it over that date is not necessarily a great date. That's a very large promotion day. What is that, Fat Tuesday? You know, so it's a drinking holiday.And, you know, so that date in particular might be a difficult one because our managers are needed for operation of a bar. But I am concerned and do want to represent the ownership and Joe has just been put in as a manager and I think under public comment last time they were concerned that, you know, we've madesteps to discipline employees that didn't follow the rules. And we've actually had some people have been let go because they weren't applying to the the correct procedures on the patio.Okay. Thank you very much. Time's up. Thank you. Sure. And I also just want to make sure that. And I think the comments are appropriate. But we're obviously speaking to the motion, which is to to move the item forward, which is what the motion is on the floor.And so.Please. Hi. Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Council constituents, I'm not sure I understand what your motion in.The motion on the floor is to take the item, which is the hearing for the for the entertainment, for the licensing over, I believe it was two weeks so that it would be heard continued. And I think that the the motion that you want to clarify was because we're still some items need to be worked out.Vice Mayor.Exactly. There's some conditions that I'd like to have further discussion on.I see. Okay. Well, in reference to that, uh, you know, I would just piggyback off of what the gentleman said. You know, it is there the livelihood of the bar in the community to have the continuous entertainment or to have that move forward.Um, I'm a local resident now. I mean speech, a close neighbor to the Brit and um, I don't find any, any disturbance with them. And I do, I do see if, if you move into an area when you're, when you're around a bar, that's kind of.The. The choice you make. If you want quietness, go to Lakewood. It's a vibrant community we live in and. Yeah.Okay. Thank you. Any other public comment? Okay. There's a motion on the floor to move. I'm sorry, sir. Sir.Mr. Mayor, I also have. I'd like to speak again.Absolutely. Do you want to hear the last of the comment first?I do. Was there someone else?I think this gentleman is wants to speak.Yes, sir. Mr. Mayor and City Council, I appreciate your time. My name is Jerry Cochran. I own the property at 1735 Second Street and 1732 through 1738 Broadway. My building is directly adjacent to the Brett. And I really take offense at somebody saying that this is the same as an airport.There was a time when the British did not have a patio.And my tenants had the right for peace and quiet. And as recently as two weeks ago, we had an incident on a weekend where there was noise out there.To the tune of 2:00 in the morning. So I understand.They're making changes and trying to adapt.I appreciate that. But the noise level, particularly of my tenants on the Broadway building, are directly above almost directly above that patio. And my concern is the timeline that they're going to have this going on is going to prevent my tenant from.Getting rest.Which means I'm going to have vacancies and I'm going to lose income. And I think it's important that all of us.Have an opportunity to make income from the businesses that we run in any area. Thank you.Thank you, sir. I no other public comment. Vice Mayor Lowenthal.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Wanted to thank the owners and the resident that came to speak. And I appreciate that the second speaker on behalf of this item were to proceed with the item, indicated that he lived close by, which he didn't quite specifically state how close by.But you don't live right next door, I'm certain. And that notwithstanding. When the writ opened. And for however many years until we got here, you did not have a patio. So your conditions and you've evolved you've evolved to the status that you are now and the community has evolved with you.What the property owner indicates is very true. And so our obligation here as a council is not just to look at the economic interests of business, but also to provide a balance. I represent downtown Long Beach, along with Councilmember Gonzalez, and that's where the dining entertainment district is.This is not our first time at looking at entertainment permits. I have looked at more entertainment permits than any other district because that's where most of them are. And so I'm very familiar with this need to ensure that we are very friendly to those who are operating businesses here.But we're also offering a promise to the residents of Long Beach that their quality of life is just as important. And so there's a balance to strike here. So I am not inviting anyone to move to Lakewood. I think that's personally quite offensive.And any one of our residents that heard that, believe us, that that's not our interest here. Our interest is to ensure that we can all live happily together, balanced and respect one another's right to a quality of life.So that having been said, Mr. Mayor, I am willing to, if you will allow it, sidebar with the owners to see if I can work out a couple of these things through my Chief of Staff.

No, I would. I would like that. I think that sounds very reasonable. So what we'll do is Vice Mayor Lowenthal will spent some time with you, with the ownership group to see if we can work out these issues.While we're doing that, I'm going to move the agenda forward. Vice Mayor, if you don't mind, we'll continue the agenda. Okay. So with that, the I don't think we need a motion on that. Is that correct?We would need in motion if it's not concluded by the end of the public comment period in order to move on to the next thing, we can table it.I have a lot of public comments, so.We have lots of speakers as you.Do. So let me move on to public comment, general public comment. So thank you for that. So Vice President, I was going to chat with you guys.I'm going to some break up. Okay. There's just a very few specific issues. I'm pretty confident he's okay.So the vice mayor staff is going to chat with you guys. Okay.Thank you.Thank you. So let's go and move on to public comment.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nNo. Arts Council Resolution 281 has been adopted. All right, Madam Secretary, if you could please put the next item on our screens. And, Councilmember Torres, if you please put Bill to 82 on the floor.I move the council bill to 82, be ordered published.Thank you, Councilmember. It has been moved and seconded. We're going to questions and comments on this one. And I'll just start by saying, you know, again, as we enter uncharted territory and as there are new recommendations coming from the CDC and from our public health officials, every day, we have been trying to dove in and look atwhat might happen, what could happen and be prepared for those situations. One of the things that exists for us now is that even if we were to decide that it was in the best interest of public health, that this body not meet, and that is not something that we have decided as of yet or that is planned. But in any situation that might lead to that. R And to still require that we come someone come down and open that meeting, take attendance, show that there is not a quorum of us here to conduct that meeting and then close the meeting, which has happened a couple of times over the course of the last four yearsbefore we, you know, fixed some of the weeks that we don't meet, the four weeks of the year that we don't meet. We had a couple of times where so many people were out of town on, you know, family stuff that we had to do just that.And so as we're grappling with, you know, our open meeting rules with what's in the charter about how we conduct our business, this was one of the things that was identified that we can fix. It will take two readings.So we're introducing it today and we'll have it again next week. But that allows for in an emergency situation for the cancelation or suspension of a meeting without our secretary coming down here to do that often with, you know, any members who are available only to determine that there is no need for a meeting.So that's kind of the crux of this as we move forward, you know, continue to identify ways and places where we can adapt. I think there's a broader conversation that this particular issue has shown a light on that we that that we need to look at, you know, from a code we participate not in this room.And what does that look like from access to the public? Could the public participate in something that needed to move forward without being in this room? And, you know, other cities have taken action to amend their charter and allow for virtual participation or amend their open meeting rules.And I think that's something that we need to take a good look at. Doing that quickly and on the fly as we're doing it is hard and we want to make sure that we get that right because there's a lot that goes into that beyond just the current situation that we're in.But as we work through that, if we continue to identify places that can be fixed, that do make sense and can or couched in areas like during periods of emergency that give us some increased flexibility items like this that we can continue to bring forward.You know, I also want to just thank some of our colleagues who were not here today as we continue to also heed the recommendations of our public health officials. And out of, you know, the phrase that I think we're all getting sick of hearing, but out of an abundance of caution, we have some members who are nothere this evening. And I think we're going to have to continue to grapple with how do we conduct business and make sure that we are able to do that. And part of that is making sure that, you know, when someone feels that they should or should not be here, that enough of us are here to continue conductingthat business. But one of the members who wasn't here, you know, really has some questions about how do we not just at this meeting, but get getting updates from the administration on stuff like we were just talking about about what kind of funding is coming through, what kind of programs are there, what needs legislative action and allof this? How can we help? How can we assist? How can we work as a team? So we'll continue to look at outside of the tight confines that we're in. From a charter perspective for this meeting, are there other opportunities for us to get updates, briefings that don't require people to be in the same room outside ofthis meeting? And how do we navigate that? So certainly the beginning of conversations to come, but this was one part that gives us some some flexibility under certain scenarios that we may or may not face in the coming weeks.All right, Councilmember Sawyer.Thank you. I couldn't have put it better. That was a great kind of summation of the conversations that we have had over the past week. And I think it's really important, you know, for the public who hasn't been able to be a part of those conversations as readily to kind of catch people up on on what ishappening. So so, you know, because this is an emergency, because we are in an emergency that none of us expected to be a part of. You know, I think it's important that both of these rules be moved forward and be adopted tonight.That said, I think that when we are no longer in an emergency, we need to go back and have some serious discussions about what these look like and how we move forward from here. Because I do think that we need to talk about things like remote participation.And if we had talked about remote participation before now, we would be able to remotely participate now, and that would be fantastic so that we wouldn't have to be here and having these conversations right now. We wouldn't have to all be in this in this room.There are precedents across the state for remote participation. It's something we could be doing. And it's a shame that the that we've got members who can't be here tonight for various reasons and who, you know and and who should be able to participate.If we had done this earlier and had these conversations previously, we they would be able to be here. So I am I am supportive of putting forth both of these rules this evening, both of these ordinances and establishing them.But I'm also suspicious of them. I think that they are they are being put in place fast. They are being put in place without the kind of full, broad spectrum discussion that we probably need to have around them.And I think that we need to make sure that we go back and have that discussion and make some changes to these when we're no longer in an emergency. And I just want to make sure that that's on record.So thank you, Mr. President.Thank Councilmember Councilmember Gilmore.Thank you, President Clark. I am in full support of of this bill tonight and putting it forward. I think that we do need to have more conversation about what the tools are at our fingertips fingertips now. And I have talked with Kirsten Crawford, our city attorney, and asked her to put together a legal memo, at least identifyingthe top two or three next steps that we could maybe evaluate, especially with our committee structure. Could we do some sort of remote committee structure so that at least there's transparency for the public to see what's happening within city government or what those other tools may be?We don't need to speculate on what those are tonight, but if we're really looking at another eight weeks of restrictions, the public does deserve to know what is going on and have access to that. And I just want to be able to explore what our options are.Thank you, President Clark.I think Councilmember. Councilmember Hines.Thank you, Mr. President. I've just learned from one of our colleagues who isn't here tonight that the CDC has revised its guidance once again and and says that there should be no more than ten people in a room at a time, which would make our meetings difficult just to and not violate the CDC guidelines.Of course, this is a very fluid conversation since the CDC issued their other guidelines for 50 people, I think, on Friday or Thursday. So we're we're moving very, very quickly. And I want to recognize Councilperson Sawyers comments about we should think about this at some point in the future when we're not having we're not basically up againsta wall. But I do have a question for Ms.. Crawford. Would it be possible for us to add a placeholder for open public virtual meetings for council and not have that defined since we're changing the ordinance with this build to 82?I mean, should we amend it and add that tonight or should we wait?So I think I understand the question. Kirsten Crawford Legislative Council under three point to 3.3.2 of the Charter. There are very rigid requirements that apply to regular Monday meetings. So the only way we've been able to thread the needle to make less rigidity is to talk about the schedule.The charter used to provide the council had to meet shall meet 52 weeks. We changed the charter to make observance. We to make accommodations through ordinance for observance of holidays. We are not alone with our rigidities. There are some other large cities both in Colorado and nationwide that have some of these rigidities.I do think there is a possibility to go fairly quickly to virtual meetings when it comes to any other sort of body or council committee, for example. It's not without complications, but it can be done. It's a very large policy debate, but there we've become a little bit focused on one tool in the toolbox, virtual participation, whenI think there are many others that still need to be explored. And that's one of the conversations I've had with Councilwoman Gilmore. And those conversations are occurring throughout the city. So so we will be coming forward with more proposals to allow accommodations.Great. Thank you, Ms.. Crawford. And thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilmember. All right, see no other questions or comments, Madam Secretary. Roll call on accountability to wait to.Clark I.Gilmore, I.Herndon High.Cashman.High.Can each.Sawyer I Taurus I Council President.All right, Madam Secretary, please close the voting.

Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nItem two, report from Development Services, recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record, conclude the public hearing and declare the ordinance. Amending the amending Title 21 of the Long Beach Municipal Code related to alcohol, beverage manufacturing and accessory tasting room.Read the first time and lead over to the next regular meeting of the City Council for Final Reading and Adopt Resolution to submit the amendment to Title 21 to the California Coastal Commission for their review and certification and accept the categorical exemption citywide.Thank you. I'm going to turn this over to the city manager and to make a quick, quick start presentation. And we're going to go on to some some comments and council deliberation. Mr. WEST.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Members of the Council. Madam Clerk, I.Believe an oath is required.I don't believe there is an oath required, sir. Correct?That's right. There's no oath required for this item.Okay. Thank you. And then we had that. Here is a note. With that, I'd like to turn over the staff presentation to Amy Bodak, our Director of Development Services.Mr. Mayor, members of the City Council, and particularly to Mayor Garcia and Councilmember Gonzalez, this has been a long time coming for us, and I want to specifically give some history to this current sitting city council and of the efforts to amend the municipal code.A couple of years ago, there was a request by former Council member Garcia to consider amending the municipal code to allow us to expand our flexibility, particularly in the in the realm of manufacturing, of craft beers and craft spirits.As you probably know, there is a trend in the state and in the country to to focus on craft or artisanal products and distilleries and craft beers are certainly a burgeoning industry in Southern California. In order to take advantage of those opportunities, we looked and did a number of of we did a lot of a lot ofresearch on areas within the state that are also doing this, particularly San Diego, who too seems to be a leader in Southern California, but closer to home, Culver City and Torrance, and then more recently, Santa Ana and Anaheim.Those those cities are leading the trend in creating more flexible land use patterns that would allow the manufacturing of craft beers or spirits with with certain proper development standards. So what we are asking for tonight is your consideration to amend the municipal code to allow for a definition of alcohol beverage manufacturing uses and provide clear development standardsthat would not create nuisance activities for the neighborhoods so that these businesses may go in. We do allow this type of use in the downtown plan area and the first craft brewery is going to be locating soon called the Blender, which is going to be at Long Beach Boulevard, just south of Third Street.That was the first craft brewery that will allow manufacturing to occur on site. And through that, that pilot project, we did determine development standards that would reduce any potential nuisance activities because of those those potential for nuisance activities.We are we are limiting the amount of production that a facility would be able to produce without getting a conditional use permit. We are also requiring that a tasting room not exceed a certain percentage of the floor area, typical of all alcohol business control licenses or ABC licenses.We would not allow any of these facilities to be located within 500 feet of a school, preschool, kindergarten, etc. and that also all production and storage that was used at the facility would be stored onsite and would be properly screened.The production, the tasting rooms would be available for members of the public to go and experience the craft beer or the spirits. And but the but the facility itself would not be open to the public. There would be the ability to have a small onsite restaurant.But again, there would be size limitations on the restaurant as well in order to not impact the neighborhood with parking parking nuisance activities. So with these restrictions or development standards in place, we believe that there is an opportunity to allow this type of use without a conditional use permit in specific areas of the city.And with that, we are proposing that you consider this ordinance and these development standards. I am available to answer any questions you might have. And we also have a couple of staff members who are experts in the craft brewing and can also answer questions from a personal experience as well.Thank you. I think first there's any public comment on the hearing before I go to the council. Casey None. There's a motion on the floor by Vice Mayor Lowenthal on a second, but by Councilman Mongo it just as a note, we actually two separate motions.First is the receiving the ordinance, the second part of the commission piece, correct? Mr. City Attorney That's correct. Thank you. So this is for the first one. And I'm going to make some a couple comments. I'm trying this over to Vice Mayor Lowenthal.This is an item that Vice Marie Lowenthal and I submitted actually just last year in 2014 and February. One thing about Long Beach, it's happening right now, which is really exciting, is there are some incredibly well known and well-respected craft brewery craft breweries that have opened up throughout the city and that are really getting national attention.Places like Beachwood Barbecue, there's a place that's been brewing for a long time, BBC and Councilman Price's district, which is a really well-known place, and there's a lot of interest for these kind of specialty type shops there. They're not they're not bars, per se, but they're places where we're where this kind of growing industry of of beerand craft beer is growing. And there's places like San Diego and Denver and Austin that are really have captured this market. It usually brings a lot of people to enjoy the area and to spend significant dollars in ways.A lot has become a lot like wine tasting for a lot of there's craft beer connoisseurs and there's there's wine connoisseurs. So this policy will help us expand our reach. And I want to thank the staff for working on it.And I also just wanted to add one piece. I want to make sure is Barack that as part of the motion we had discussed after passing this of putting together a kind of specialized brochure like this, like San Diego has to talk about the process of opening up a brewery or a microbrewery or a distillery and wantto make sure that we still put put that together.Yes, sir. And I would like to apologize to Vice Mayor Lowenthal. I know that you were involved. And I do want to acknowledge that, because without your leadership, with the mayor's leadership, we would not be able to push this item forward.So I do want to thank you for your involvement as well. But to Mayor Garcia's point, yes, we will be following up with a specific how to guide. We have had interested parties approached the city as recently as this past week, as well as over the past few months, because they have heard that we are interested inrelaxing our restrictions. And so there is growing interest in this. And we are becoming you know, we are becoming known in the area as the next potential wave for this type of industry to occur.Thank you. Vice Mayor Lowenthal.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And Mr. Burdick, I certainly don't mind if you don't ever associate my name with the adult beverages. That would be okay to take a pass on. So. But I am proud that we worked on this.Not all kidding aside, I think one of the things that the mayor and I have said for many years and certainly now, Councilmember Gonzalez is Long Beach celebrates its own sort of craft industries and no pun intended, but the craft beer industry is something that we are getting to be known for.And I'm very thankful that Beechwood Barbecue is here in our city and has invested in our city at a time that I think it was difficult to get those sorts of nationally recognized entrepreneurs and businesses to find homes in Long Beach.And so I'm glad that we have come this far. I know we are still working on the other item that the mayor mentioned, but really I do think this is an installment toward that and it provides great opportunities.People are looking to the Los Angeles County region for this sort of business, this sort of craft beers. But I think Long Beach has something very unique to offer, certainly by way of its placement, where we are and what kind of infrastructure we have and how people actually come to this city.And so it's it's nice that we have our bike lanes nearby. And I think it's all part and parcel of creating this sort of a culture that, if exercised responsibly, adds to really the luster of our city. Thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.I appreciate the work that you guys have done on this matter and look for other creative ways to bring more businesses to Long Beach. So thank you.KATZENBERG Ringo.I do want to thank both of you for bringing this voice, a visionary, bringing it last year as opposed to the first hearing. This is a youth where we could sell alcohol and have a wine tasting and have craft beers that everybody can enjoy.And it's and it's in a in a setting that would be more conducive towards bringing people to Long Beach and be able to recognize that we have some high end level of libations that everyone can enjoy. So I want to thank Amy and her staff for all the research they did in terms of looking at other citiesand what they're doing there and looking forward to opening up our first establishment. And I have a feeling that I'm going to be the last. I'm going to hear about this.Thank you. With that, please take a vote on the first part of the motion.Motion. Motion carries eight zero.\nReasoning:Reasoning:",

Thank you, Madam Clerk.Item 18 is a report from Economic and Property Development Recommendation to authorize city manager to amend the requirement of a purchase and sale agreement with the L.A.. Be reducing the initial deposit from 500000 to 50000 on the purchase of for sale and future development properties, and to reimburse two 350,000 intended and or for such improvements to thefor sale properties along Atlantic Avenue between 55th Street and South Street and 620 and 635 South District eight and nine.Okay. We'll go ahead, Councilman Austin.Well, thank you very much. And before we hear from staff, I'd just like to say that this is an exciting day for Long Beach, specifically the North Village and surrounding neighborhoods. That includes the eighth District and ninth District.Today's council approval of the amended agreement would allow will allow a real chance for more formative project to move forward in North Long Beach. Almost two years ago, in July 2015, when the four former redevelopment properties were up for sale, I had an opportunity to meet with Shaheen Sadeghi, the CEO, and Chris Bennett from the lab, ourfirm at our former field office in the North Village, one of the properties that was actually for sale. We walked along Atlantic Avenue and South Street and discussed the vision and greater possibilities for this area as it got a better feeling for the neighborhood.Their vision for the project actually grew, and the lab is now looking at investing in a major project here in Long Beach that not only includes those original store fronts in the North Village, but also about 30 parcels, including vacant lots across the street from the Michelle Obama Library.The lab has a true, proven track record of commercial development that demonstrates a unique vision for creating a sense of place and a destination that draws visitors from throughout the region to enjoy unique eateries and boutiques that give a neighborhood a special identity and revitalize character.The Anaheim Packing District, or Central Street in historic downtown Anaheim, are examples of this or the lab A.I.M. in the camp in Costa mesa. It has taken nearly two years to work out all the deal points to move this project forward.In addition to Shaheen, I'd also like to thank Roman Carini from the lab, who was here this evening, work for working with the city to get this to this point and finding solutions to reach an agreement. I'd also like to recognize our city staff in economic development, including DA John Keisler and Sergio Ramirez, for finding creative waysto overcome hurdles in their work hurdles. With all that said, with this deal in place, as I share with Ramon, we now are anxious to see this project move forward in a very timely manner. Many of the storefronts in the North Village have been vacant for several years since the redevelopment agency was dismantled.The residents in North Long Beach have been waiting for this project for many years and they have watched Bixby nose and other corridors in other areas of the city made great strides. I'm glad tonight that this that we're going to use redevelopment sale proceeds to help fast track the the move.Improvements on the existing storefronts in the north village while additional development concepts are being worked on. And if I can borrow of a quote from Casablanca, I think this is a beginning of a beautiful friendship between the city in the lab and the residents and businesses of Long Beach will be the ones to benefit.And so, members, I would ask for your support. I know we have a a presentation that I think will impress you all. Thank you very much.Thank you. And, Councilman, we range of comments before the presentation.This is a wonderful partnership between the city and the developer. And I and I totally support this project. It's a way of dealing with our blight. I mean, since redevelopment went away, we have to use creative ways of dealing with our blight.And this is certainly one way of doing that. And I appreciate all the assistance that we're getting from our staff as well as with the owners. Thank you.Councilman Orson.As I mentioned, obviously vice mayor of Councilmember Richardson is not here. He and his staff have also been working very. Very diligently and hard as partners. We have had a shared vision to to really make Atlantic Avenue a destination and an active corridor throughout the city of Long Beach.And this will be a critical piece, if I can just emphasize what this means to North Long Beach. This is would be similar to our L.A. life. Right. You know what L.A. life did for downtown Los Angeles? This project will be L.A. Life for Long Beach, North Long Beach.And so northtown. The best is yet to come.Thank you. And I'm going to hear that we're going to do the presentation. I just want to say I have to first is to the Councilman Austin and Vice Mayor Richardson, who I know I believe is having a a exciting family moment right now.I think his wife is going into labor as we speak. And so he had to exit. But we're very excited. I'll be honest with you. And the councilman knows this. This is one of the most exciting projects we've had.This is this is a a home run project. And I just really want to thank Councilman Austin, Vice Mayor Richardson and the developers for this, because this is, I think, one of the best things that's going to happen to our city in a very, very long time.And so with that, I'll turn this over to Mr. West for the presentation.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Council members, this is part of the dissolution of the redevelopment agency. We're disposing of some of our successor agency parcels in North Lomita and District eight and District nine, and I echo exactly what all the council have said and also the mayor.This is going to be a fantastic development. I'm going to turn it over to the director, assistant director for economic development of Property Services. They put a lot of hard work and equity into these projects to make sure that we have a financial scenario that works both for the city and also for the developer.And this truly will change the face of North Long Beach when it's concluded. So that John or Sergio.I honorable mayor and members of the City Council, I'm going to actually turn the presentation over to Sergio Ramirez, who is our deputy director, who's embraced this project from the beginning. He's he's the one who's briefing.Our various departments and coordinating the effort. And so, without further ado.Sergio can give us a little bit of an overview of this wonderful project.Thank you, John. Good evening, honorable mayor, honorable council members. As you're aware, one of the key improvement areas in the city is the North Village area along Atlantic Avenue in council districts eight and nine. Since the dissolution of redevelopment, staff has been working to bring forth a truly transformative neighborhood revitalization project to this area.The city has partnered with the land developer of the camp and lab in Costa mesa and Anaheim Packing District to bring a project to this area. In 2015, the successor agency approved the sale of blocks m b, consisting of 18 noncontiguous parcels located along Atlantic Avenue to the land for rehabilitation at the amount of $3.6 million.Subsequently, in 2016, the City Council approved the sale of two future development sites BLOCK C and D, also in Atlantic Avenue to the lab for development in the amount of $2.5 million. Recently, the lab determined that building renovation and improvement work on blocks and B would be funded internally with while outside financing would be utilized to fundthe development of the future owned properties Box C and D. Further, the lab will initially activate occupancy of rehabilitated properties with internally owned businesses to help establish the area and help bring forth additional private investment due to the transformative nature of the proposed project and proposed capital intensive nature of the renovations and developments.Staff has determined that it's vital for the lab to preserve equity to satisfy the various financial requirements of the proposed future development projects, to assist the lab in preserving cash assets necessary for investment into the project. Staff recommends first reduction of the deposit from $500000 to $50000 be made with an increase to the promissory note in thesame amount, the city's new note amount would be $6.89 million, an increase of $450,000. Secondly, staff recommends a portion of the North redeveloped project area share of proceeds from the sale be designated to reimburse the lab for tentative improvements and exterior facade renovations in and in an amount not to exceed $350,000.Staff recommends approval of this item and we're excited to collaborate with the developer and all city departments to begin work necessary over the next 12 to 18 months to get this project underway. This concludes our report. Well, John and I are here to answer any questions.And as it was previously identified, Mr. Roman Katrina and and is here for the lab to answer any questions. Thank you.Thank you. Again, impressive presentation and very exciting project. Is there any public comment on this item? Please come forward. The South Council District three has a former employee in Costa mesa. I'm very familiar with the lab. Costa mesa is not Long Beach and the lab works in Costa mesa because it's freeway adjacent and it's off Bristol, whichis a huge thruway in the city. So the lab proposal here, North Long Beach is impacted. If you can't make Atlantic whiter, you can't make South Street wider. So it's going to be a traffic problem. We're not really freeway adjacent in any way, shape or form there.I don't know if the residents understand the concept behind what's going there and their land values, how they're going to change. So the development that we will be experiencing here. An ocean is now moving to North Long Beach, which I was just kind of waiting to see when that would happen.So I'm actually excited for a project like this, but I'd like to see Long Beach businesses have first opportunity there in the lab. One is developed. I'd like to see Long Beach employ people that need jobs, get first choice at those jobs as well, but find some way to make the lab, which is pretty hipster down inLong Beach to reflect the community of in customers excuse me but to make it reflective of Long Beach community and where it's going, artists perhaps.People on make it.Hip in our Long.Beach way. But again, the traffic is will be a problem. Parking will be a problem. It's already parking right now. But I think the greatest thing that's happened up there in that particular area is the free Wi-Fi that I can use when I'm up there visiting.Those are my comments. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please.Hello. I'm Sylvia Contreras, and I just came to say thank you. I've been looking forward to that project to get started. I was looking forward to a michelle Obama library and opened up and I was excited to be there.I don't know how many opportunities I'll have to be at a library opened, but this is going to be an opportunity again, a first timer for a Long Beach resident within walking distance of that time. Yeah, I have thought about the traffic, what's going to happen there?But you know what? What's going to be going on is supersedes that all the way. So thank you very much.Thank you. I see no other public comment and no other council comment. Members, please go and cast your votes. We do have actually a one other comment. I'm sorry about that.Oh, Joe. Sorry to be late. My name's Chris Bennett.I'm with Lab Holding. I really appreciate the opportunity to work in your city and really excited to work on this project. The lab, the company is a little American business. That's where our company acronym came, comes from. And we are focused on providing local independent jobs and local independent businesses.To create.Something that's very unique and Long Beach specific. And that's what we try to do in every community that we work with. And we're very excited to work in Long Beach.Thank you.Thank you very much. With that, we still have having some issues with our ah, our functioning board here according to some people. So let's do a voice vote starting on the end.All right.That's councilwoman. K motion carries unanimously with those members present. Thank you. Moving on to item 25, please.Item 25 is communication from Councilwoman Gonzalez, Council Member Peers and Council Member Turanga.

Are there any questions from members of the board? Councilman Ortega.Jeffrey, if you wouldn't mind, coming up. So is the improvement district folded within? An existing metro district or is it independent of a metro district?Yes. So general improvement districts are independent of metropolitan districts.Okay. And I know they can tax themselves as well. So how many? So 20 mills are being added. Is that what I heard you say to Gore, correct?Yeah. The budget for next year anticipates a property tax of 20 mills on the properties within the district, which is actually a reduction from what it used to be prior to 2016 when the district paid off its debt.And what was that?And you're going to ask me that. I think it was 35 mills when we had bonds outstanding.Okay. I was just trying to look at the budget here in our. Report. Give me a second, because it looks like in the this budget is significantly higher, at least in what it's showing us than it was in previous years.If you have the whole budget in front of you, there's a summary page that shows 2018 and 2019 on it.Okay.In 2020.Yeah, I'm pulling up a different document than I was just looking at. But this is the full budget, so. So the reason for the reduction. In the in the mills. You said it was 35 and now it's 20.Yes, I believe that's.What is the reason for the reduction?The district has no more outstanding bonds, so it issued bonds back in the late nineties and those were paid off at the end of 2016. So it didn't need that extra revenue for any debt service. So now we just use our revenue for operations and we basically fund projects as we.Just to cover this budget. Mm hmm. Okay. That's all I have questions about. Thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman C.A. Other questions? The public hearing for Council Resolution 11 zero five is closed. Comments from members of the board. Right.

The Sport Court at Marina Vista Park. The Luke to Sue Johnson Court.Councilman Price.Thank you. Vice Mayor, I, I want to I know this is an item that my colleagues will support, but I can't resist talking a little bit about why this item came to be, because this was a very special person in my life and in the life of my community.In 2005, a group of third district students, middle school and high schoolers were involved in a youth participatory budgeting program. One important member of the student committee was 15 year old Luke Johnson. Luke was a resident of Alamitos Heights and lived close to the park with his mother, Rena, father Todd and brother Spencer.Luke was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of 14 on the very day he started his freshman year at Wilson High School. In 2006, Luke lost his two year battle with leukemia. This journey took him out of school throughout his early high school career.The committee became one of the ways that he was able to stay in contact with his peers during his illness and was a responsibility he took seriously. Luke was well-loved in the community and he was a friend to everyone.His deeply missed by the community, his peers and his family. In honor of his community involvement and the role that he had and the Marina Vista Sport Court being built, the community has expressed its support for naming the new sport court in Luke Johnson's memory.I ask my colleagues to support this item. I have I did ask Luke's parents not to come tonight because I know this is going to go through a process and I don't want them to keep having to come to council meetings.Once the process goes through the motions, we will do an official naming at the park and have a lovely celebration with his family and the members of our community.Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Austin, very public comment on the same.Hello. My name is Alex Phillips and Luke Johnson is a child that lives in my neighborhood. I know his parents, I know his brothers.

Sorry, this is unorthodox filing this, but we're in a period here now where we won't have any hearings, we don't have any committees. And both of these things are looking to be implemented in the in the month of January.So that's why we have the 17 FS sorry for the late file. I ran up against the holidays and didn't get them filed on a on a. In the proper timeline. The first one is the first one is about the the the the mandates.The the. The COVID vaccination mandates. And I'm not taking the position. I'm for it. I'm against it. But what's going to happen here in the next little while that I want clarification is is first of all, what jurisdiction do we have to go into private business and tell them they have to collect or they have to dothe vaccine passports? But more importantly, we're talking about hundreds of people here that can potentially lose their jobs, whether it's police, firefighters, teachers, people that are collecting tickets, people that are giving tickets. Every department is going to be affected by this.We have no idea who they are, what they are, how many they are, and if they're going to have an opportunity to be able to come back to work if they comply. I'm looking for some clarification on this.And the second one is on is on the Roundhouse Hotel, which I defer. I couldn't be any more different from what the pathway that this administration is taking right here. Simple things. Who's the leaseholder is? Is it Public Health Commission?What's our what's our commitment going to be there? Meaning what's our money commitment going to be in there? Is it going to be drugs used on on the premise? What is the what is the the the security plan?When we asked in a meeting what the security plan was, a person from from BMC said it was very high level. So whatever that means, I can handle high level. I want to know what that security plans are.Again, these these were all filed because we are unable to have hearings now. We don't have our committees. We don't have our we don't have our. Yes, we won't we will not be having hearings for a month now.So this is this is pressing. And in the 17, if it's it's a face to face meeting, I would like to have someone sitting in front of me and explain to me all these things here. The Roundhouse isn't a surprise.It's not a surprise. We've been asking for over a month here all these questions I've been on record sending it over to this administration, all these questions. So it shouldn't be a surprise why they're not being why they're not being answered.We're asking the people on the street if they want hotel rooms. We're not asking the neighborhood what their their opinions are. It it reminds me if you ever wanted a question answered about the BPD and Menino, good luck.You never get it.

Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThe report of the Planning and Zoning Committee Agenda Item six Council Bill 118 974 Relating to housing and building maintenance. Amending limits for code sections 22.220 2.0 8020 2.206.0 20.0 40.0 50.0 80.0. 90.1 ten 131 4161 7022 point 14.0 50 end point zero 86 antimony Ortiz 1240 11.The committee recommends the bill passed as amended.Councilmember Johnson, thank you.This is the rental registration and inspection ordinance and probably the reason why everybody else is still here with us this afternoon. I'm really proud of the progress we've made so far on improvements to the rental registration and inspection ordinance.The bill, as voted out of committee, made five changes. One of those changes was technical in nature, but the other four made some pretty significant differences. And I'd like to thank Councilmember Herbold for bringing those amendments forward. They incorporate references to requirements related to lead paint modify.The percentage of units selected for inspection requires inspection reports from private inspectors and amends requirements related to lead paint, carbon monoxide alarms, minimum fire and safety requirements, improving security standards and other technical corrections. We had asked for a little bit of additional time between the vote committee and the full council vote in order to better identify arange of issues within the checklist to better classify failures. One of those failures that we hear a lot from the private sector landlords are that tenants disable their own smoke detectors. It's one of the most common, if not the most common failure that we get in our rental registries and inspection ordinance.And obviously a very different type of failure than the kinds of failures that we heard during public comment, like very significant mold issues or other safety issues. So we were intending to try to identify a set of ways to respond to that checklist.We just didn't quite run run into enough time to be able to do that. So we did set up a pathway that allows the department through director's role to continue to work with community partners and landlords and others to identify a lot of issues identified by Washington can Columbia Legal Services and other folks during the public comment. So I believe this is a really good step forward and continues to provide important protections for the 50% plus of our city who rent for their housing and really look forward to seeing what the outcomes of that additional work by the department looks like and commit to our friends who are still here that we're going to continueto do work in this fall's budget in order to make sure that we're adequately funding the department to continue to do their work. Thank you.Thank you, Captain Johnson.I'm sure Councilmember Herbold has something similar.To Councilmember Herbold. Thank you. You're good.Now. A couple of minutes. Oh, yeah, a minute.30 seconds.I just want to thank the community partners as well as landlords for sharing their concerns with my office and thank Councilmembers Johnson O'Brien for supporting the amendments that I move forward during committee. In particular, the creating criteria for requiring additional units for inspection, I thought was very important.DCI had the the administrative discretion to to do that and has had it for a number of years. But we keep hearing of buildings that fail their REO inspection, but that aren't getting the additional inspections of units prior to a decision being made of whether or not these buildings are actually passing, but they're failing individual inspections withouthaving a trigger for inspecting the whole building. So this is really, I think, important in identifying not just the need to correct violations within individual buildings, but to make sure that that's not indicative of other problems in the building.In addition, the reduction of the amount of notice to property owners of units selected for inspection I think addresses another sort of problem that has been identified with this program since its inception, which is there's among some landlords, certainly not all.There is some gaming of the system when landlords know which units are going to be inspected and they have a lot of notice, they are able to go in, fix those those problems quickly so that there's no indication to the to the department that there may be a problem in the in the building.And then lastly, the request that inspectors leave information in the unit after completing an investigation I think is really important to increasing tenant knowledge. In a building of the conditions and in ways to address those conditions in the future.And then finally, there's a signal of this council's interest in the future to address the program fees in such a way that we can evaluate and address any imbalances in the fee structure for small landlords while continuing to set the fees to cover the cost of administering the program.Thank you. Catherine Herbert. Any further comments? Thank you very much. Please call the roll on the passage of the bill.Burgess. Gonzalez Herbal. Hi. Johnson. Suarez. O'Brien. Swan. I beg your president.

Members of the City Council, we are bringing our H.R. staff, and here they are. Alex Vasquez and her staff will give a short presentation.Good evening.Dana Anderson, who is our manager of labor relations, is going to give a short overview of this item.

And a 3% six months later.

This concludes my brief staff report and I am available to answer any questions you may have.Thank you very much. We do have a motion and a second. Let me first we'll briefly public comment on this item. Mr. Goodhue, anything? Nope. Mr. Pritchard. Richard. Here he is.Rex Pritchard, president of Long Beach Firefighters Association. I just want to thank specifically Dana and Irma. They are tough negotiators. It was not an easy process at all. But this is a fair contract for both the city and us.It's going to really help. I believe the fire chief helped retain and recruit a diverse workforce and a highly competitive Southern California market, especially with L.A. City and L.A. County. So, again, we appreciate all the support and thank you.Thank you. And before we turn over to the motion, I just want to just make a couple comments as well. I want to I want to just begin by by thanking our firefighting team. Obviously, Mr. Pritchard, his whole team and our rank and file firefighters are what we have in front of us for adoption is a fair, responsible and forward thinking contract of the process of negotiations. Negotiating is typically tough. And you certainly have in our in our case, a stellar fire department that we're incredibly proud of. I want to note that I very grateful that our negotiating team went in.I'm thinking about things that were also important to the council and our firefighters. It is very important for us to ensure that our firefighters, that entire team at the department are not just well compensated, but that they have the types of benefits and the type of support needed so that we can recruit the very best.And we should always want the absolute best for our firefighters and our public safety officers. That's why I strongly support this contract and why I'm very proud of the council for getting us getting us here. I also just want to note that one thing that's in this contract, besides some of the adjustments for some of our ourfirefighters so that they can receive a fair a fair, fair pay and around certain skills is I know that our parental leave program is also being added to this. And again, Long Beach is ahead of most agencies where we are offering a very, I think, forward thinking parental leave program for all of our firefighters.And and as we did for our police officers just a few weeks ago. And so, again, thank you to our firefighter team, our negotiating team. And I'm very excited to move forward and get this contract done and to ensure that our firefighters have the support that they deserve.With that, Councilmember Richardson.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I just want to take a moment and chime in to thank our negotiating team and our rank and file firefighters for coming together on a fair deal. It's smart and balanced. I recognize as quality public services, which is important to our constituents every day.And also one thing that I want to acknowledge, that, you know, a lot of our firefighters are are young folks and they're growing, you know, families. And it recognizes the importance of family medical leave. And that's important to our city.And I'm glad to see that they were able to come to terms on that. And so this is the kind of deal that helps us maintain our status as a world class city and a world class fire department.Thanks a lot.Thank you very much. Councilmember Ringo.I thank you better. And I think you said it all. You covered all the important points about this agreement. And I want to congratulate the fire department and Mr. Prichard for his willingness to negotiate. Negotiations like these are always tough, and they don't happen unless there's an agreement with the city.And I think I want to congratulate actually both sides, both teams working together on a tentative agreement that is going to work for the city. Thank you.Thank you. Vice Mayor Andrews.Yes, thank you, ma'am. First of all, I want to thank our firefighters and our team and everyone else who made this item before us possible. You know, our firefighters deserve this and so much more over the years that their role and responsibility have grown.And they have came to work every day and work with our community with grace. So the bargain is never easy, but work for us is worth it. So I want to thank each and every one of you for being a big part of this.Thank you again.Councilmember Pearce.Yes. I'd also like to thank everybody that worked on this. I know that negotiations are probably some of the the toughest moments with our city. Really proud to see that we're rolling out parental leave and that they now have access to four weeks of that, that we as a municipality are really leading on that it's good tocontinue to see it. And what's most exciting, I think, is the mental health support that we're offering our first responders. Obviously risking your life every single day on the job and knowing that you're you're also risking an increase of having cancer by 100%.Like, these are big things. And having Long Beach be a city that people not only come to and do our training academy, but that they stay. And we know with fire that this is one of the biggest challenges that we have.And so I really think that creating a robust agreement really helps us retain those employees. So thank you, everybody, for a fair contract.Thank you. Councilman Price.I want to echo the comments of my colleagues, and I think this is an appropriate time to just share the following experience that we just had in CD3 that underscores exactly how important the work our firefighters do is.So we just had a really significant sink hole in one of our communities in the third district. It may seem like that's not that big of an issue, but we had about 40 homes, did not have water. We had a huge hole in the ground that was about eight feet deep, maybe even deeper than that and verylong. And we had fire was out there first. They were out there. They were on scene the entire time, having a presence there, letting the neighbors feel that they were safe, providing refuge if needed. They set up a command center with our police department nearby.And they and also our police department was there letting residents know that they were safe and that they were being watched over and they were being cared for. This is an example of city departments, multiple city departments working together, health, public works, water, police and fire.And they work together really well. But for me, there was so much piece of mind driving up or walking up the first day to the location, seeing our fire trucks there, seeing our firefighters there and seeing our police officers there.There's just such a sense of peace and safety when you see that and to be able to support public safety in our city for things like crime, but also things like sinkholes and emergencies where people need to rely on our first responders for peace of mind.And safety is just you can't underscore to mess with words. You have to be there to witness it. So I'm glad for that for this contract, because I do think it makes our fire service and the city of Long Beach competitive so that we can continue to attract candidates that are professional and competent and represent the citywell. And I thank our firefighters for their service, and I really am pleased with our city team. So thank you to our team for your negotiations and for your communications with council. You left, you know, nothing unsaid you shared with us and we felt included in the entire process.So thank you.Thank you so much, Councilwoman Mongo.Thank you. I want to take this opportunity to put out a big thank you to the Long Beach Fire Department. Over the past few months, I've gotten to work more closely with the new command team, and I will say that I am thoroughly impressed with the way in which this department takes care of each other.There are departments across the region who are losing personnel at alarming rates because there's such a shortage of individuals that want to enter into this field and have the physical fitness and wherewithal to make it through an academy.And we are so fortunate that very few of our our our family fire, a family of firefighters, even consider it because they really do feel taken care of by each other. And I want to thank the city staff for their work on this contract.It is so important that we have a contract that is fair and balanced for our community and specifically for our firefighters and our police officers. So thank you.You could hear what he did. I already did. Public comment, sir. I did public comment already. Councilmember supra you actually you spoke in support. Answer your. Now, you already spoke to the sign of.Okay.Next up is Councilman Austin.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I don't think I can say anything that hasn't already been said, so I won't echo anybody's comments, but I will say congratulations to our city team for negotiating a great agreement with our Long Beach Firefighters Association.I think this contract will will certainly help us recruit and retain high quality fire service professionals moving forward and maintaining quality services in the city. I will just say that that I'm. Relate it to actually have this opportunity to vote on this contract, because I've been here long enough to know that it hasn't always been been thisway. And so salute to all the parties for for working to get to an amicable agreement. Thank you.Thank you. And counsel for.And I'd like to to thank the negotiators on both sides city staff and local 372. Great job to hammer out a fair deal. I just don't want this moment to pass without recognizing what took place yesterday in the history of the fire department with the restoration of E17 17 and thanks to the chief, all the command staffand Mayor Garcia and my council colleagues for supporting that. It was a great day and that is one incredible firefighting force. When 17 and 17 roll out those bays. Thank you.Thank you very much. And Mr. Good here you did.

The committee recommends the bill pass.Thank you, Councilmember Bagshaw.Thank you very much. And thank you to Seattle Public Utilities that came to our committee the last month and provided us with the information about the stormwater code. The bill passed unanimously out of our committee under the Federal Clean Water Act's Municipal Stormwater Permit.Seattle and similar municipal governments are required to periodically update regulations for stormwater practices and facilities. This ordinance includes three immediate changes that save the city money while still controlling pollution and complying with ecology requirements and those requirements. They include a number of specific projects, but they're going to make our water quality treatment thresholds for the roadway projectsequivalent to ecology thresholds. They will exempt from Seattle public utility drinking water pipe projects from water quality treatment and green stormwater requirements consistent with the ecology requirements. And will also allow our Seattle Public Utilities Director to designate areas through a director's rule where new development may be exempt from the code's stormwater flow control requirements.Because the city drainage system has sufficient capacity to handle any increases in flow related to the development. I know that sounds very exciting to those of you who haven't been participating in it, but it's a very exciting project that I appreciate ESP moving forward on.So we will achieve equivalency with the Ecology 2014 Stormwater Manual.

Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nAgenda Item five Council.Bill 120124 Relating to the Organization of City Government Creating an Office of Economic and Revenue Forecasts, the committee recommends the bill pass. Thank you so much, Madam Clerk. As Chair of the committee again, I'll provide the committee report and then happy to open it up to any additional comments on the bill.Colleagues, I'm excited to be voting on this legislation today after nearly nine months of collaborative negotiations with the executive to develop this legislation. I believe that establishing the Office of Economic and Revenue Forecasts will create a more open, transparent and robust forecasting process that will enhance both the Council's and the public's access to and understanding of thecity's budgetary forecasts. The implementation of this office should also improve the dynamic between future councils and future mayors by building a stronger foundation of trust and balance between the branches as it relates to the development of the city's budget priorities.There are two prominent events during 2020 forecasting process that highlighted for me and many others how important it is to level the playing field between the council and the mayor's office with regard to our access to information related to the city's forecasting process.Those events prompted me, my staff and central staff, to look at alternative models for how governmental bodies develop their budget forecasts. And indeed, both Washington State and King County utilize independent forecasting offices that are outside of the legislative and executive branches.King County went so far as to pursue a voter approved charter amendment in 2008 in order to create their Office of Economic and Financial Analysis. Fortunately, based on my and central staff's review of the analysis conducted by our City Attorney's Office, we at the City Council are able to establish our own independent office in a manner consistentwith our city charter. And the legislation we're voting on today is reflective of all of the feedback that we received from the city attorney's review and their legal advice upon its creation. The Economic Revenue Forecast Office would provide independent forecasts and economic analysis, fulfilling the policy intent of the Council budget action that this Council previously took.And that was included in the 2021 budget that was adopted. It would also consist of three and a half full time equivalents through a combination of newly created positions and transferred positions from our city budget Office and Finance and Administrative Services.This new office would be headed by a director who would be hired by and report to a new forecast council comprised of the mayor, the city finance director, the council president and the Council Budget Chair, or their respective designees.The Forecast Council would be responsible for providing oversight of the new office and for approving the forecasts. The Governance and Education Committee did have a conversation and presentation on this particular proposed piece of legislation and unanimously recommended that the Council bill be passed and adopted by the full Council.And I'd like to encourage my colleagues to join us in voting to adopt this legislation. Are there any comments on the bill? Councilman Strauss, please.I think your council president will be supporting this legislation today. I think this is a smart choice to remove a city, but to create a an office forecast office that is not tied to either the executive or the council.I'm just going to take this moment to really share kudos of the city budget office. Last year during the recession and reopening of our of our economy. Because as compared to the state level the city budget office really did an amazing job of making accurate predictions that we could work off of as compared to the state thatdid a little bit had a bigger drop and a bigger rebound. So I know that we have the tools and I know that our city budget office is doing great work. And I think that this year legislation today is the next great step.Thank you, council president.Thank you, Councilmember Strauss. Really appreciate that. Any other customer, Herbold, please. Thank you. Just really quickly, I also want to thank you, Council President Gonzales, for moving forward. The intent that the council expressed again under your leadership during the budget discussions last year to create this independent office.This is, I think, considered a best practice and really appreciate knowing that moving forward, whether or not it's at times when there are increased revenue forecasts or or potential reductions in revenue, that the Council will have access to that information as opposed to sort of the current practice where an often we find it out at the sametime when there are budget proposals to. To cut or add. So it will allow us as the body that is most responsive, engaged with the public to to give input to those budget discussions and decisions. Thank you. Thank you.Councilmember Herbold, Councilmember Peterson, please.Thank you. Council President. I wanted to also explain my support for this new office. There were some articles written about this proposal recently that delved into legal issues and looking at the city charter. And I think that it was healthy to to to raise these issues.I did some additional research, got additional comfort with with that aspect of it from a from a practical standpoint, having worked for a budget chair many years ago and the timing of these revenue forecasts has also been a source of frustration.And so I think it's important to to have both branches collaborating on on this. This data about what the revenues are going to be, how we're predicting them, and having that information at the same time so that we're so that legislative branch isn't sitting around waiting.When is this information going to come so that we can then figure out how to make decisions since we ultimately have to adopt the budget and decide whether to amend it. So I was really pleased when you brought this proposal up and then the more to geologists I've done, it seems like it's going to be good forthe city that we have this information at the same time, both the executive and legislative branches. So thank you for bringing that forward.Thank you, Councilor Pearson. Appreciate that. Any additional comments on the bill? I've not seen any other hands raised, so I'll go ahead and closes out. I think Councilmember Peterson stole the words right out of my mouth. And that's the note that I wanted to end on, is that I think that as the budget appropriation authority, it hasseemed odd to me in the six years that I have served on the council to oftentimes feel like we are caught on the back of our heels when we're receiving revenue forecast changes in the middle of and sometimes towards the end of our budgeting processes.So I think that this bill will allow for more equitable access to information and to more timely access to relevant information in a way that will really allow and facilitate for the co-equal branches of government at government, at the city of Seattle, to really function like co-equal branches of government, and to make sure that both of ushave an opportunity to really fulfill our duty and obligation as both the budget proposer and the budget doctors for the City Government. So I'm excited about an opportunity to advance this bill and appreciate the ongoing support of my colleagues in the effort to advance this this important, important piece of legislation.Did want to thank did want to thank Cody writer in my office for all of his hard work over the last nine months, as well as Ali Pankey and Tom McPhail. And also, of course, appreciate the the collaborative opportunity that we had with the city budget office and with other members of the executive to come up witha shared plan and vision on how this can be achieved in a way that fulfills both the executive's desire and ours as well. So with that being said, I'm going to go ahead and close that debate and ask that to please call the roll and the passage of the bill.GROSS Yes.HERBOLD Yes. Suarez.

This legislation moved out of committee with a unanimous vote. Three in favor directed investigations are necessary because noncompliance with Seattle's labor laws still occurs in many sectors. Last year, the Council clarified the Office of Labor Standards Authority to do directed investigations.They are investigations that do not rely on a complaint from a worker. And specifically, the legislation passed last December provided that the Office of Labor Standards may initiate an investigation pursuant to rules issued by the Director, or when the director has reason to believe that a violation has occurred or will occur, or when the circumstances show thatviolations are likely to occur within a specific business sector because a vulnerable workforce is unlikely to file a complaint. What this resolution does is it sets out a process for the Office of Labor Standards to develop this as a new program.Specifically, this resolution requires the Office of Labor Standards to provide quarterly updates beginning at the end of the second quarter. And those updates will include progress on the issue of how they are involving the office sorry, the Labor Standards Advisory Commission in the development of this new program, the data that the Office of Labor Standards will useto decide where to focus its investigations, the percentage of investigations that they anticipate being these proactive, directed investigations over the next five years with the goal of at least 10% next year.

She's a pharmacist. She actually works at CVS in Alameda where she tells me she's been given lots of COVID vaccines.Hooray for you as a 16 year resident. And she is the mother of a kindergartner and fourth grader who are very involved in the library and library programs and just have participated in all kinds of programs. And she has a lot of great ideas for making the library more accessible to everyone, including geographically, including out in thethe West End, where maybe something like a bookmobile out at Alameda Point might be a way of bringing the library to people who can't come to the library. And then I'm also nominating Miss Sarah Strickler, who's a works for Google as a a service designer, and that's a designer of people's experience with various products.And and she spent a lot of time looking at case studies about libraries, how to make them more user friendly, how to make them more efficient and friendly to the staff, to all users, and.Just lots.Of enthusiasm. I love the fact that she's a Googler and she's young and all that, but she loves to just go and sit in the library and read books, actually flip the pages and read books, including cookbooks as a way of relaxation.So thank you.

That requires that the chief of the Seattle Police Department submit an annual report on the implementation of that chapter to the mayor, the city council and the city clerk for filing as a public record.And so really what this annual report does is that it lays out the type of information that the Seattle Police Department may have collected in the prior year for law enforcement purposes. There are requirements under the Seattle Municipal Code that that require destruction of that certain types of information, if it is gathered.And this is the chief's obligation to report to us and the general public as to the agency's compliance with those those retention and or destruction provisions within the ordinance and consistent with Council Central Staff's Report and the chief of police report, it appears that the ordinance has been complied with.So this is our due diligence in filing this report publicly consistent with the muni code.

Madam Secretary, please put the next item on our screens. And, Councilman Flynn, go ahead with your question. Or is this the one that.Mr. President, I ask for under rule 3.7 for a one week postponement for this resolution, which is the amendment to the photo radar and photo red light contract. At Mayor Council last week, both I and Councilman Lopez asked for additional information.And at this point, we have not received any answers yet. And so failing that, give them one more week to answer the and provide the information we asked for about how the intersections were chosen for the new red light cameras, what the accident rates were, what the yellow change interval timing changes might have been, and what othercountermeasures might have been taken before putting up cameras that photograph accidents rather than prevent them. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman Flynn, Councilman Lopez.And thank you, Mr. President. I also wanted to chime in with that. I do support the the the postponement to January 2nd for the same reasons. You know, when I was in committee, I asked the same questions that I asked in mayor council, and that is regarding the intersection at 14th and Federal Boulevard.It's still very unclear and I haven't got any kind of answer yet whether we whether CDOT indeed studied that intersection or not, and that they studied 14th and federal and said no formally. And the other question I have is whether the city even asked whether they to study the intersection.We still haven't I still haven't received adequate information or any kind of response as to whether that indeed took place. It is a very dangerous intersection. It's an intersection, I think, that would benefit from a tool like like our photo radar, especially when it comes to pedestrian and auto accidents.I know that typically photo radar is intended for folks that are running red lights and auto and reducing auto auto accidents. We all can agree that a lot of you know what would remedy the situation would be more officers.But since we do not have the budget and we've actually came down in the number of folks on patrol, these questions are important. And it's important to know, especially when as a city, we've signed on to a Vision Zero philosophy and goals.So I would love to have some kind of response to those two questions. Definitely.All right. Thank you, Councilman Lopez, Councilwoman Ortega.Thank you, Mr. President. Generally, I am supportive of photo radar in our community. Photo red light that helps us look at keeping our intersections safe. The one thing that I was surprised and if this was already mentioned, I apologize because I was out in the hall.But when we had the presentation to our committee and learned that the data that is collected on accidents does not include pedestrians that are struck by a vehicle or fatalities that involve pedestrians, that is not part of the data that Vision Zero looks at.It's only car accidents, cars against each other. And I think we need to be collecting that data because we already know, for example, Federal Boulevard is one of the most unsafe pedestrian corridors. We've had a number of fatalities in Councilman Flint's district by Loretta Heights.We've seen a number of serious injuries. I'm not sure the stats on fatalities at 14th and federal where we have a rail stop, but people cross that to catch a bus and they'll dart across traffic. I've seen that multiple times because I'm in that area on a regular basis.And it's not to say this is the only corridor and the only intersection in the city. But I think it is important that we begin to collect the data that helps us to be more accurate in targeting the resources where we need to address them.And we know that 14 in federal is, in fact, one of those intersections that has had a lot of challenges and problems. So I support the postponement so that we can have more discussion about this and be able to bring it back.And hopefully, I don't know what the the lever is to get us to start collecting the pedestrian data, but I think around the city that is really critical. I don't even know if it includes bikes, but if bikes are not included as well, that that should be in terms of the accidents and potential fatalities as well.Thank you.Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega.

        "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nMeeting transcripts:\nI have some comments and questions. I think if we can address the questions raised by Ms.. Fortuna, that would be great. I think one of the things that we want to definitely try to be clear about is that.The policy through the policy, AMP is making every effort to cover costs. But I think what what I'm hearing from his Fortuna is now how is it that that we're characterizing the cost and how is it that we know that we're going to cover it?Is that honest? Why are we certain that that that in other words, where.The CPC Rule 32 allows for telecommunication companies to set aside a certain amount of money per year they collected already on their rates. So we're all we're all paying for it already. That money set aside in a reserve fund for programs like this.So as the program gets implemented, as long as we have met CPC criteria, the CPC regulated companies such as AT&T or Comcast can pull from that regulated money. They're required to pull from that regulated money to cover the costs.My numbers are a little bit different, actually, to put a piece of conduit in the ground and run a run on AT&T service lateral or Comcast lateral actually has very little cost involved in it at all. The trench is already going to be opened up to run the underground, the underground service.And in fact, in a lot of modern developments, Comcast will go ahead and put their stuff in for free because they're going to recover that recover that in their in their pricing structure. So the the piece of conduit in the underground isn't really a very big cost at all for AT&T, and it is covered under the rule30 to a recovery.Well, thank you, Mr. Drake. I really appreciate that. Ms.. Fortune, I hope. Now on the matter of an American on the matter of cost, I do want to. Well, let me just say from the outset, I think the process that you put in that started under the leadership of Girish and mentioned and and continued by Mr. GlennSteiger, I think we're incredibly credible process. We certainly appreciate it. And I think the policies and the plans that are before us are also incredibly great. So let me just make sure to state that from the outset. But I do again on costs.And I want to add, the reason why I'm driving on cost is because, you know, when we say we're going to make every effort to cover the cost of items, you know, we're we're really raising the bar here.So and and and we want to make sure that it's a promise that we can keep. And I suspect it is. On Policy three, for example, on Policy three identifies that you UDV will fund the underground utility district fund will fund all necessary conversion costs up to a pre-established limit.That's policy three. So we have a sense of what the pre-established limit is. And then Policy five says that we're going to basically review every five years. The one thing that I just want to make sure. In a way, this is an accounting issue.But. But it could have subsequent. It is important. I want to make sure that we take into account the effects of inflation, basically in terms of how we characterize the cost of an issue. So for example, let's go back to Policy five.Policy five says that we're going to readjust the costs every five years. Well, if the actual cost of doing an undergrounding for a house is $3,000, $4,000, whatever, you know, digging up the ground, getting the labor, if the actual cost is $3,000 in year one and let's say AMP produces a document say that says per policy three, that is our pre-established limit, $3,000. So the actual cost is $3,000 in year one. And if we assume just a normal rate of inflation of 3%. It's not bad. Five years from now. From then, $4,000 will equal roughly $4,600.If we had it because you compound it but $4,000, let's say hypothetically, $4,000 in year 2000, $16. Is the same thing as $4,600 in year 2021 because of inflation. So I want to make sure that that that. We don't still have the $4,000 in the books, in our documents, and then five years later, we require someone topay 600 extra bucks.Hmm.So I want to make sure that we're going to adjust the well effects of inflation.That won't happen under this policy for a couple of reasons. It's a very good point that you're making. The first is the pre-established limit is is denotes denotes the the cost of the master contractor doing the work and establishes that there are some limits to the program.If people want to go above and beyond those limits, they're going to do so at their own cost. However, the program is designed to cover 99.9% of the cost. The second piece of it is, is that every five years, so there's not an established cost.There is the cost that the master contractor denotes for that particular you you'd at that particular time. Interestingly, over the last five years, since every four years since we got what you would cost, we did a price check and costs haven't changed that much.Not to say they won't in the future. However, with that rate of inflation, the rate of the 2% that we're going to be collecting is going to increase as well. And so you're going to see the fund increase at some incremental level, whether it's benchmarked to inflation or not, above or below.But it's going it's going to go up. Also, just one thing that the project doesn't necessarily readjust after five years of simply what we're simply doing, what we didn't have before was any kind of check mechanism for the entire policy.We don't have a formal mechanism for bringing the policy back. We believe that five years is a good time to come back to council and say, is this still the policy we want? And the answer may be yes or no, you could be.Now people need to contribute or share differently. It could be some other socioeconomic economic reason, but it doesn't necessarily change any kind of dollar amount because there is no pre-established dollar amount. It really is. The fund is going to fund what it costs to do the program.Ultimately, we may decide to do things differently, and that would be a council decision with public input.\nReasoning:Reasoning:",
        "answer": "The meeting transcript revolves around a discussion on the cost of implementing Policy 3 and Policy 5 related to undergrounding utility lines.

In June of 1993.The City of Long Beach entered into a 25 year franchise agreement with a Southern California gas company or SoCal Gas, to allow natural gas pipelines owned and operated by SoCal Gas, which run through the city of Long Beach to provide natural gas delivery services to certain residential and commercial customers within the city of Long Beach.That agreement expired on June 7th, 2018. For the past several months, Long Beach Energy Resources staff have been in negotiations with SoCal Gas to enter into a new franchise agreement, and a tentative agreement has been reached. Under this new agreement, the City of Long Beach will continue to receive fees based on the gross annual receipts and imputed. Value of Nonproprietary Gas.Delivered to SoCal Gas customers residing and operating within the city of Long Beach.

The purpose of the fund is to receive funds and distribute LTG bond proceeds.We will not be issuing the bonds right now. We are going to be punishing that fund with funds from an inner fund loan. That's $8.2 million of an interphone loan from the Construction and Inspections Fund to this newly created fund.We will then pay back the $8.2 million to the Construction and Inspections Fund once we issue the LTE LTE go bond fund. And then finally, the bill itself creates a new capital project within the capital improvement program. The new capital project is called Fire Station 31.Replacement Project.And really appreciate the leadership of Chief Scoggins, FRC Director Kevin Calvin Goins, Local 27, and Councilmember Juarez, who is also a sponsor of this legislation, really tipped tip of the hat to Councilmember Juarez for her efforts during the budget process last year and identify $100,000 of funds as a way to jump start the need for this replacementstation. Thank you. Councilmember Herbold, are there any other comments on the bills before us?Um. Council, president, council or more is here. Did you want me to address briefly the three, or did you want to do this?Yeah, we are. We are discussing all four bills right now. We'll take separate votes. So if you have any comments on any any of the the three bills, now's the time to make those comments.Great. Okay, great. Yes. Items four, five and six. First of all, thank you, Councilmember Herbold, for covering the basics and some of the detail on the financial plan. Obviously, I'm glad to see this legislation before us today to relocate fire station 31 in the Northgate neighborhood in District five.A special thanks, of course, to Chief Scoggins, Calvin Goins, Bass and Kenny Stewart, the president of Firefighters Union IAFF Local 27. The fire station is located south of Northwest Hospital, north of Northfield College and west of I Am and Northgate Mall.As many of you recall, the growing Northgate neighborhood lost our station 31 last summer when firefighters were all relocated to other stations. Relocation was necessary due to environmental testing, which revealed unhealthy conditions. And as you remember, this has been an ongoing issue for a few years.And since then I've been pleased to be in regular contact with both Chief Scoggins and director Calvin Goings about next steps. They review the current station capacity, the current system demand on the station, and the forecast for future demand, according to Chief Scoggins, Fire Station 31 is one of the busiest stations in our city.In addition, the relocation of firefighters last June resulted in higher response times that exceed the fire department standard. So high response times that makes us very happy. In the end, the city concluded that the current station 31 is too small to meet the needs of anticipated population growth in the North End, particularly with light rail coming atNorthgate and hopefully our other station up the road and on 130th. But in any way, immediate needs of growth and increased service demand. So rather than trying to salvage an environmentally unhealthy and uninhabitable station that will soon be too small, the recommendation was that the station should be replaced.And so with that, I urge my colleagues to pass. Item Council Bill 119780 Council. Bill 119782 Council. Bill 119781. Thank you.Thank you so much. Councilmember Warrens. Any other questions or comments on any of these three bills? Customers want lawyers.Thank you. And the bill is, of course, support improving the infrastructure of this yellow fire department, including the development of the new fire station 31, which is essentially being authorized by these three bills for council members who agree with the power station 31 charge.I just wanted to point out, for the benefit of the public that the building agenda item five is. Totally routine legislation authorizing the internment loan. The city uses an indefinite loan to make your funding immediately available when it can most efficiently be used and stage the plan for how the loan will be repaid.And I hope members of the public notice the difference between how the political establishment has talked about this and de-fund loan products proposed by Mayor Durkan. That is not at all talked about it. And the interest on loan proposed by Councilmember Morales and NE in our Amazon tax bill to make COVID relief stimulus checks immediately available tothe neediest of Seattle's working class families, ultimately to be paid for, of course, by the tax on big business. Rather than discuss the substance of the Amazon tax and the COVID relief and the jobs program that it will fund, the political establishment instead has mostly focused on the administrative, intertwined loan legislation in an attempt to sow confusionand distract from the substantive issues the mayor has toward new station, saying, quote, The entire fund loans, the funds that they want to rob, I am not sure that they have the authority to do that because those were all voter approved initiatives.As importantly, to the extent that there is the ability to having to fund loans, which is a budget technique, we may need that just to balance the budget this year. So there is no scenario under which people will receive checks this year.And I think that's really not responsible to tell people during these really hard times and good oatmeal. Durkan will clarify if she also thinks that irresponsible to tell the fire department that they will be purchasing the land for Fire Station 31 this year, funded with this indoor fund loan, obviously an indoor fund loan of $200 million forCOVID 19 relief for up to 100,000 working families. Is that a totally different scale than the $8 million on loan at worst, ongoing question today. And it would be appropriate if elected officials were openly to discuss whether the city had actually had funds to cover a loan of that size, which is precisely why we made sure thatCity Council's Angel staff's research was presented that strongly demonstrates that the city does have sufficient funds. Instead, the mayor has dishonestly claimed that it was somehow technically impossible or even illegal to carry out an internal fund loan, which is a common tactic used by the political establishment to confuse ordinary people in their fight for social justice.You know, for example, in Congress for decades, they have justified opposing single payer health care by claiming that it is just impractical and too complicated. And working people should not believe that those lies for one moment. So I will, of course, be voting on yes on all three legislation, including the totally routine legislation authorizing the interest onloan to provide the bridge funding for the fire station 31 project. And I urge members of the public to see this example of how an interest loan authorization legislation was approached as a completely uncontroversial issue compared to the way the mayor has reacted to the Amazon tax legislation related interest.If you council members want any other comments or questions from my colleagues herbal. Captain Kathryn Swann partially made this. But I just want to underscore, this is a very, I think, different in scale. This Interphone loan is for $8.2 million and the source of the Interphone loan is a is a very different source so that the sourceis the construction inspections fund for a small number of dollars. It is not $50 million from four different voter approved levies. I'm not commenting on the legality of of the latter funds. I'm just saying that this is a different source of of funds for the the Interphone loan, and then it's a much smaller number of funds.I think he can't remember any other comments. Okay. Great. Thank you so much to both councilmembers Herbold and Suarez for walking us through these bills. Looks like there are no other additional comments, so we're going to move forward with each bill and councilmembers will have a final opportunity to provide comments if they wish before we vote oneach item. So we'll begin with item four. I will move to pass Council Bill 119780. Is there a second?Second, second, second.Thank you. It's been moved and seconded to pass the bill. Councilmember Herbold has already spoken to this bill. Are there any additional comments on the bill? Hearing and seeing the clerk.
