He is standing in a queue near the entry gate, from the gate he could only see legs of the animals in the farm and he counted the total number of legs to be 30. He already knows that there are only ducks and horses in this farm. From this information find the number of ducks\nReasoning:", "answer": "We know that ducks have 2 legs and horses have 4 legs. If we assume that all animals are ducks (which have 2 legs), then the total number of legs would be 11 animals * 2 legs/animal = 22 legs. However, Harper counted 30 legs, which is 8 more than 22. These extra 8 legs must belong to horses, since horses have 2 extra legs compared to ducks. Therefore, there must be 8/2 = 4 horses.

He already knows that there are only ducks and horses in this farm. From this information find the number of ducks\nReasoning:", "answer": "We know that ducks have 2 legs and horses have 4 legs. Let's say the number of ducks is D and the number of horses is H. From the information given, we have two equations:\nD + H = 19 (total number of animals)\n2D + 4H = 56 (total number of legs)\nWe can simplify the second equation to D + 2H = 28 by dividing the entire equation by 2. Now we have two equations with the same format:\nD + H = 19\nD + 2H = 28\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives us H = 9. Substituting H = 9 into the first equation gives us D = 19 - 9 = 10. So there are 10 ducks in the farm.\nAnswer:10"}, {"prompt": "Solve the following math problem.
