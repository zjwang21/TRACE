Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nQuestion:\nHow many moles of Silver nitrate are required to react with 3 moles of Sodium hydroxide to form 3 moles of Silver Hydroxide along with 3 moles of Sodium nitrate\nReasoning:", "answer": "The balanced chemical reaction between Silver nitrate (AgNO3) and Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form Silver Hydroxide (AgOH) and Sodium nitrate (NaNO3) is as follows:\n\nAgNO3 + NaOH → AgOH + NaNO3\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of AgNO3 reacts with 1 mole of NaOH to produce 1 mole each of AgOH and NaNO3. So the mole ratio between AgNO3 and NaOH is 1:1. This means that the moles of AgNO3 required to react with 3 moles of NaOH will be 3 moles.\nAnswer:3"}, {"prompt": "Solve the following math problem. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nQuestion:\nFind molecular weight of N2O\nReasoning:", "answer": "The molecular weight of a compound is the sum of the atomic weights of the atoms in its molecular formula. The atomic weight of nitrogen (N) is approximately 14 and the atomic weight of oxygen (O) is approximately 16. The molecular formula of nitrous oxide (N2O) indicates that it consists of two nitrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Therefore, the molecular weight of N2O is (2*14) + 16 = 44.\nAnswer:44"}, {"prompt": "Solve the following math problem. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nQuestion:\nFind the number of moles of Water formed on combining 1 mole of Carbon dioxide and 2 moles of Ammonia\nReasoning:", "answer": "The reaction between Carbon dioxide (CO2) and Ammonia (NH3) can be written as follows:\n\nCO2 + 2NH3 → (NH2)2CO + H2O\n\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, we can see that one mole of CO2 reacts with two moles of NH3 to produce one mole of Water, along with Urea.\n\nGiven that we are combining 1 mole of CO2 and 2 moles of NH3, and considering the reaction stoichiometry, it follows that 1 mole of Water would be produced.\nAnswer:1"}, {"prompt": "Solve the following math problem. Give your reasoning first, and then the answer.\nQuestion:\nCalculate molecular weight of Ammonium iodide\nReasoning:", "answer": "The molecular weight of a compound is calculated by adding up the atomic weights of each of the atoms in its chemical formula. The chemical formula of Ammonium iodide is NH4I. The atomic weights of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Iodine (I) are approximately 14, 1, and 127 respectively. The molecular weight of Ammonium iodide is therefore calculated as follows: (14*1) + (1*4) + (127*1) = 14 + 4 + 127 = 145.\nAnswer:145"}]
